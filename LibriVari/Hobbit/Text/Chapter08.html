<h2>Chapter 8<br/>
Flies and Spiders</h2>
<p class="normal"></p>
<p class="normal">They walked in single file. The path was narrow and winding. There were black squirrels in the wood. There were queer noises too; but what made the noises they could not see. They saw dark dense cobwebs, often stretched from tree to tree. There were none stretched across the path, though.</p>
<p class="normal">The forest seemed endless, and they began to hate it. But they had to go on and on. The nights were the worst. But in the complete darkness they could see eyes. They slept all closely together, and took turns to watch; and when it was Bilbo’s turn, he could see pairs of yellow or red or green eyes in the distance, and then they slowly faded and disappeared and slowly shone again in another place. “Insect eyes” he thought, “not animal eyes.”</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo was always hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions. They once shot a squirrel with an arrow, but when they roasted it, it had a horrible taste, and they shot no more squirrels. They were thirsty too, for they had very little water, and in all the time they had seen neither spring nor stream. And then they saw that their path was blocked by running water. It flowed fast and strong, and it looked black. They remembered that Beorn had warned them against it, so now they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves. Bilbo looked ahead and suddenly cried:</p>
<p class="normal">“There is a boat against the far bank!”</p>
<p class="normal">“How far away is it?” asked Thorin.</p>
<p class="normal">“Around twelve yards,” answered Bilbo.</p>
<p class="normal">“We can’t jump it,” said Thorin.</p>
<p class="normal">“Can any of you throw a rope?” asked Bilbo.</p>
<p class="normal">Fili thought he could; so he took the rope in his hand, and then flung it across the stream.</p>
<p class="normal">“Not far enough!” said Bilbo who was looking forward. “Try again. I don’t think that the magic is strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a wet rope.”</p>
<p class="normal">Fili picked up the hook. This time he threw it with greater strength.</p>
<p class="normal">“You have thrown it right into the wood on the other side now. Draw it back gently,” said Bilbo.</p>
<p class="normal">Fili pulled the rope back slowly, and soon the boat was close to them.</p>
<p class="normal">“Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo.</p>
<p class="normal">“I will,” said Thorin, “and you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.”</p>
<p class="normal">“There aren’t any oars. How are you going to push the boat back to the far bank?” asked the hobbit.</p>
<p class="normal">“Give me another rope and another hook,” said Fili. Then he threw the rope into the darkness ahead and as high as he could. The hook got stuck in the branches. “One of you,” said Fili, “should pull on the rope that is stuck in a tree on the other side. One of the others must hold the hook that we used at first, and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back.”</p>
<p class="normal">In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted stream. But then something bad happened. Out of the gloom a deer ran into the dwarves and bowled them over. Then it prepared for a leap. High it jumped. But Thorin was quick: he shot into the leaping beast. They heard how the deer fell down. Just then Bilbo cried: “Bombur is drowning!”. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the deer sprang over him. He stumbled and fell into the water.</p>
<p class="normal">They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank.</p>
<p class="normal">Quickly they threw a rope with a hook to him. His hand caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He was wet from hair to boots, of course, but that was not the worst. When they laid him on the bank he was already fast asleep; and fast asleep he remained in spite of all they could do.</p>
<p class="normal">Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their bows. None found their mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them.</p>
<p class="normal">“Stop! Stop!” shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them were useless.</p>
<p class="normal">They were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following days. They were carrying the heavy body of Bombur. In a few days there was practically nothing to eat or to drink.</p>
<p class="normal">Two days later they came to a valley filled with oaks. “Is there no end to this damned forest?” said Thorin. “Somebody must climb a tree and have a look round.”</p>
<p class="normal">Of course “somebody” was Bilbo, because he was the lightest. Poor Mr Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they lifted him up into the lowest branches of a huge oak, and he had to climb up.</p>
<p class="normal">In the end Bilbo got to the top. His eyes were almost blinded by the light. He saw all round him a sea of dark green; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. But he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction.</p>
<p class="normal">He climbed down full of despair. His report soon made the others as miserable as he was.</p>
<p class="normal">“The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! What shall we do?” they cried.</p>
<p class="normal">That night they ate their last crumbs of food; and the next morning when they woke it was raining. The only good thing was that Bombur woke up suddenly. He had forgotten everything that had happened since they started their journey long ago. The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit’s house.</p>
<p class="normal">When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak. “Why ever did I wake up!” he cried. “I was having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this one, only with torches on the trees; and there was a great feast going on.”</p>
<p class="normal">There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, and go on. So they walked all that day very slowly.</p>
<p class="normal">Suddenly Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: “What was that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest.” They all looked, and they saw a red twinkle in the dark. So they hurried along then. The light was in front of them and to the left of the path, and at last they saw torches and fires burning under the trees, but a good way off their track.</p>
<p class="normal">“It looks as if my dreams were coming true,” gasped Bombur. He wanted to rush into the wood after the lights. But the others remembered the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn. “A feast will be no good, if we never get back alive from it,” said Thorin. “But without a feast we won’t remain alive much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo completely agreed with him. So they decided to leave the path and go into the forest together. They crawled quietly and peered round the trunks. They saw many people there, who looked like elves, all dressed in green and brown. The people were sitting in a great circle. There was a fire in the middle and there were torches fastened to some of the trees; but best sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing.</p>
<p class="normal">The smell of the meal was so delicious that all the dwarves got up and went into the ring to beg for some food. But as soon as the first stepped into the clearing, all the lights went out as if by magic.</p>
<p class="normal">They were lost in complete darkness and they could not even find one another. At last they managed to get together and count themselves by touch. They didn’t think of the food because they were really afraid to lose each other again. By that time they had forgotten where the path was.</p>
<p class="normal">Then Dori said in a loud whisper:</p>
<p class="normal">“I can see the lights are again over there.”</p>
<p class="normal">Up they all jumped. They heard the voices and the laughter quite clearly. When they got near the lights, Thorin said: “Don’t rush forward this time! I will send Mr Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won’t be frightened of him, and I hope they won’t do anything bad to him.” When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind. Before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell. But it was worse this time. They simply could not find the hobbit. They shouted and called: “Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! Where are you?” but there was no answer.</p>
<p class="normal">Suddenly Dori stumbled across Bilbo. The hobbit was fast asleep. When he was awake he was not pleased at all.</p>
<p class="normal">“I was having such a lovely dream,” Bilbo grumbled, “about a most gorgeous dinner.”</p>
<p class="normal">“Good heavens! He is like Bombur now,” they said. “Don’t tell us about dreams.”</p>
<p class="normal">Soon Kili came and roused them all again, saying:</p>
<p class="normal">“There are hundreds of torches and many fires over there!”</p>
<p class="normal">Up they got again; it was the same again and this time the result was disastrous. Thorin stepped into the centre of the circle.</p>
<p class="normal">Out went all light. Bilbo was running round and round and calling:</p>
<p class="normal">“Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield.” Soon he was alone in complete silence and darkness. That was one of his most miserable moments. But he decided to sit down with his back to a tree and stay there until morning. Bilbo was dreaming about food when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already wrapped, so that when he got up he fell over.</p>
<p class="normal">Then the great spider came from behind him and attacked him. Bilbo had a desperate fight. He beat the creature off with his hands until he remembered his sword and drew it out. Bilbo cut the string around his legs and then he struck the spider with his sword and killed it.</p>
<p class="normal">The spider lay dead beside him. Somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great difference to Mr Baggins. He felt a different person, and much bolder in spite of an empty stomach.</p>
<p class="normal">“I will give you a name,” he said to the sword, “and I will call you Sting.” After that he went to look around. The forest was gloomy and silent, but Bilbo had to look for his friends.</p>
<p class="normal">He crept quietly in the direction from which the cries for help had come. Soon he noticed spider webs. Suddenly he saw, too, that there were huge and horrible spiders in the branches above him. He heard their voices. The spiders were talking about the dwarves!</p>
<p class="normal">“It was a serious struggle,” said one, “but I hope they are juicy.”</p>
<p class="normal">“Don’t hang them too long,” said another, “kill them.”</p>
<p class="normal">Bilbo was horrified, now that he noticed the dwarves hanging in the shadows.</p>
<p class="normal">Then one of the spiders went to the dwarves. “There is no time now,” thought Bilbo. So he picked up a stone and threw it at the spider. The stone struck the spider on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree.</p>
<p class="normal">The next stone went through a big web, and took off the spider sitting in the middle of it. After that there was panic in the spider colony, and they forgot about the dwarves. They could not see Bilbo, but they knew the direction from which the stones were coming. So they ran towards the hobbit. Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the spiders further and further away from the dwarves. So he began to dance among the trees and he sang a song to annoy them, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice.</p>
<p class="normal"></p>
<p class="normal">This is what he sang:</p>
<p class="normal"></p>
“Old fat spider spinning in a tree!
Old fat spider can’t see me!
Stop your spinning and look for me!
You’ll never catch me up your tree!”
<p class="normal">As he sang he threw some more stones. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches. They were quick and frightfully angry.</p>
<p class="normal">Then quieter than a mouse he crawled back. He had precious little time, he knew. He had to rescue the dwarves.</p>
<p class="normal">He cut the strings with his sword and rescued Fili, Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Don, Nori and Bombur. But there were still five dwarves hanging at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back. Bilbo tried to scare away the spiders. But he had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and he had forgotten to put it on again, so now they all began to hiss:</p>
<p class="normal">“Now we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you!”</p>
<p class="normal">While this was going on, the other dwarves were cutting the threads with their knives. Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had his sword, Sting.</p>
<p class="normal">Many of the spiders were killed. But Bilbo was really tired; only four of the dwarves were able to stand firmly. Already the spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. In the end Bilbo decided to open the secret of his ring to the dwarves. He was sorry about it, but he had to do it.</p>
<p class="normal">“I am going to disappear,” he said. “I will draw the spiders off, if I can; and you must keep together and go in the opposite direction. To the left there, that is the way towards the place where we last saw the elf fires.”</p>
<p class="normal">So Bilbo suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great astonishment of the dwarves he vanished.</p>
<p class="normal">Soon they heard the sound of his song behind the trees on the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They went in the direction of the voice. Then the dwarves got together in a knot, and threw stones at the spiders on the left, and ran through the ring and went on.</p>
<p class="normal">The dwarves were very tired and weak. Every now and then they had to turn and fight the spiders.</p>
<p class="normal">Suddenly Bilbo appeared. “Go on! Go on!” he shouted. “I will fight them!” And he killed many spiders; they had become afraid of Sting, and did not come very near. At last the spiders went back to their dark colony.</p>
<p class="normal">The dwarves then had a chance to rest.</p>
<p class="normal">They lay for some time, but very soon they began to ask questions. They wanted to know the story of the ring. And then they asked Bilbo where they were, and where their path was, and what they were going to do next? So you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr Baggins very much, and had begun to have a great respect for him. They really expected Bilbo to think of some wonderful plan for helping them. Bilbo began to feel proud of himself.</p>
<p class="normal">All of a sudden Dwalin asked, “Where is Thorin?” It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. Where was Thorin?</p>
<p class="normal">Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. Do you remember Bilbo falling asleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a stone. Then the Wood elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away. The feasting people were Wood elves, of course. These are not wicked folk.</p>
<p class="normal">In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood there lived their greatest king. This great cave had many passages and wide halls; but it was lighter than any goblin dwelling. The king’s cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against their enemies.</p>
<p class="normal">It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged Thorin – not too gently, because they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing their treasure. The dwarves said that they only took their part, because the elf king had asked them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give them their pay. The elf king was really rich but very greedy. His people didn’t work metals or jewels, they didn’t cultivate the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf. So Thorin was angry, when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses.</p>
<p class="normal">The king asked Thorin many questions. But Thorin only said that he was starving. “Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people?” asked the king.</p>
<p class="normal">“We did not attack them,” answered Thorin; “we came to beg, because we were starving.”</p>
<p class="normal">“Where are your friends now? What are they doing?”</p>
<p class="normal">“I don’t know, but I think they are starving in the forest.”</p>
<p class="normal">“What were you doing in the forest?”</p>
<p class="normal">“We were looking for food and drink, because we were starving.”</p>
<p class="normal">“But why did you come into the forest?” asked the king angrily.</p>
<p class="normal">At that Thorin shut his mouth and did not say another word. “Very well!” said the king. “Take him away and keep him safe, until he tells the truth.” Then the elves shut him in one of the secret caves with strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him a lot of food and drink, though. So there poor Thorin lay.</p>
