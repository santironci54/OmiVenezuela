  <h2>III<br/>From the Farm of Bitterness</h2>

  <p class="normal">A <span>THOUSAND YEARS</span> after the men of Bora Bora had completed their long voyage to the north, a thin, sallow-faced youth with stringy blond hair left an impoverished-looking farm near the village of Marlboro, in eastern Massachusetts, and enrolled as a freshman at YaleCollege in Connecticut. This was the more mysterious for two reasons: to look at the farm one would never suppose that its owners could afford to send any of their ten children to college; and, having decided to do so, the parents must have had deeply personal reasons for sending a son not to Harvard, which was only twenty-five miles away, but to Yale, which was more than a hundred miles to the south.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gideon Hale, a gaunt man of forty-two who looked sixty, could explain each matter: ” Our minister visited Harvard and he assures us the place has become a haven for Unitarians, deists and atheists. No son of mine shall be contaminated in such a den of iniquitousness.” So seventeen-year-old Abner was packed off to Yale, which remained a haven for the honest if austere precepts of John Calvin as expressed in New England Congregationalism.</p>

  <p class="normal">As for the money, gaunt Gideon explained: “We are practicing Christians adhering to the word of Calvin as preached by Theodore Beza in Geneva and by Jonathan Edwards in Boston. We do not believe in painting our barns in worldly displays of wealth, nor in painting our daughters to parade their concupiscence. We save our money and apply it to the betterment of our minds and the salvation of our souls. When my son Abner graduates a minister from Yale, he will glorify God by preaching the same message and exhibiting the same example. How did he get from this farm to divinity school? Because this family practices frugality and avoids worldly exhibit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In his senior year at Yale, emaciated Abner Hale whose parents did not allow him enough money to live on, experienced a spiritual enlightenment which changed his life, impelling him to unanticipated deeds and imperishable commitments. It was not what the early nineteenth century called “conversion,” for Abner had undergone this phenomenon at eleven, while walking at dusk from the far fields to the milking shed. It was a wintry Marlboro night, and as he walked through the crackling stubble, frost on his breath, he heard a voice cry distinctly, “Abner Hale, are you saved?” He knew he was not, but when he replied, “No,” the voice kept repeating the inquiry, and finally a light filled the meadow and a great shaking possessed him, and he stood in the fields transfixed, so that when his father came for him he burst into wild tears and begged: “Father, what must I do to be saved?” In Marlboro his conversion was held to be a minor miracle, and from that eleventh year his pious father had scrimped and borrowed and saved to send the predestined boy to divinity school.</p>

  <p class="normal">What thin-faced Abner experienced at Yale was far different from conversion; it was spiritual illumination on a specific point and it arrived through a most unlikely person. A group of his worldly classmates, including his roommate, the young medical student John Whipple, who had once smoked and drunk, came by his room as he was writing a long report on “Church Discipline in the City of Geneva as Practiced by Theodore Beza.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come along to hear Keoki Kanakoa!” his rowdy classmates shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m working,” Abner replied, and closed his door more tightly against temptation. He had come to the part of his paper in which Beza had begun to apply the teachings of Calvin to the general civil life of Geneva, and the manner in which this was done fascinated the young divinity student, for he wrote with some fervor: “Beza constantly faced the problem which all who govern must face: ‘Do I govern for the welfare of man or for the glory of God?’ Beza found it easy to give his answer, and although certain harshnesses which the world condemned did unavoidably occur in Geneva, so did the Kingdom of God on earth, and for once in the long history of civilization, an entire city lived according to the precepts of our Divine Father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a rattling at his door and wiry John Whipple stuck his head in and called, “We’re saving a seat for you, Abner. Seems everyone wants to hear Keoki Kanakoa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am working,” Abner replied the second time, and carefully he closed his door and returned to his lamp, by whose amber light he wrote painstakingly: “The Kingdom of God on earth is not easy to attain, for mere study of the Bible will not illuminate the way by which a government can acquire sanctity, for obviously if this were the case, thousands of governments that have now perished and which in their day attended to the Bible would have discovered the godly way. We know they have failed, and they have failed because they lacked a man of wisdom to show them. . . .” He bit his pen and thought of his father’s long and gloomy battle with the town fathers of Marlboro. His father knew what the rule of God was, but the fathers were obstinate men and would not listen. It was no surprise either to Abner or to his father when the daughter of one of these perverse men discovered that she was going to have a baby out of wedlock, although just what this sin involved, Abner did not fully know.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner!” a stentorian voice called from the hallway. “It is your duty to hear Keoki Kanakoa.” The door was thrust open, revealing a chunky little professor in a waistcoat too tight and a stock too dirty. “In the interests of your soul you should hear the message of this remarkable young Christian.” And the man came over to the desk, blew out the light, and dragged his reluctant pupil to the missionary lecture.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner found the seat which handsome John Whipple had saved for him, and the two young men, so unlike in all ways, waited for the chairs on the college platform to be occupied. At seven-thirty President Jeremiah Day, calm but glowing with spiritual fire, led to the farthest chair a brown-skinned, white-toothed, black-haired young giant in a tight-fitting suit. “It is my honor to present to the students of Yale College,” President Day said simply, “one of the most powerful voices in the world today. For when Keoki Kanakoa, son of a ruler of Owhyhee speaks, he speaks to the conscience of the world; to you young men who have already committed yourselves to Christ’s ministry, the voice of Keoki Kanakoa brings particular challenges.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this, the young giant, standing about six feet five and weighing more than two hundred and fifty pounds, rose and graced his audience with a dazzling smile, after which he raised his hands like a minister and prayed: “May the good Lord bless what I am about to say. May He open all hearts to hear.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He speaks better than I do,” John Whipple whispered, but Abner was not amused, for he wished to be back at his books, feeling that he had come close to the heart of his essay on Theodore Beza when his professor insisted upon dragging him to the lecture by this barbarian from Owhyhee.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the brown-skinned giant launched into his message, not only Abner Hale but everyone else in the auditorium listened, for the engaging young savage told how he had run away from an idol-worshiping home, from polygamy, from immorality, from grossness and from bestiality to find the word of Jesus Christ. He recounted how, after landing from a whaling ship in Boston, he had tried to gain entrance to Harvard but had been laughed at, and how he had walked to Yale College and had met President Day in the street and had said to him, “I come seek Jesus.” And the head of Yale had replied, “If you cannot find Him here, this college should be dissolved.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki Kanakoa spoke for two hours. Sometimes his voice fell away to a whisper as he spoke of the evil darkness in which his beloved islands of Owhyhee festered. Again it rose like a thundering sea when he told the young men of Yale what they could do for Christ if they would only come to Owhyhee and circulate the word of God. But what had captured earlier audiences throughout New England, and what now completely absorbed the men of Yale, so that no one stirred even at the end of two hours, was Keoki’s impassioned story of what it was like to live in Owhyhee without Christ. “When I was a boy,” he began softly, in the fine English he had mastered in various church schools, “we worshiped dreadful gods like Ku, the god of battle. Ku demanded endless human sacrifices, and how did the priests find victims? Before a sacred day my father, the Governor of Maui, would tell his assistants, ‘We require a man.’ Before a battle he would announce, ‘We require eight men,’ and his assistants would then gather and say, ‘Let’s take Kakai. I am angry with him,’ or perhaps, ‘Now would be a good time to get rid of that one and take his lands.’ And at night two conspirators would creep secretly from behind while a third would walk up boldly and say, ‘Greetings, Kakai, how was the fishing?’ and before he could reply . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point giant Keoki had been coached by his missionary preceptors to pause dramatically, wait, then hold aloft in his enormous hands a lethal length of coconut-fiber rope. “While my father’s agent smiled at the victim, one conspirator crept up and pinioned his arms. The other slipped this rope around his neck . . . like this.” And slowly he twisted his two great hands together, compressing the rope into a tight knelt. Making a strangling noise in his throat, he allowed his big head to fall on his chest. After a pause, while his enormous frame seemed to burst from its ill-fitting American suit, he slowly raised his head and disclosed a face masked in pity. “We do not know Jesus,” he said softly, as if his voice were coming from a sepulcher.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he swept into his peroration, his voice hammering like thunder and tears splashing down like rain, so that the terror of his youthful days became clearly visible throughout his body. “Young men of God!” he pleaded. “In my father’s islands immortal souls go every night to everlasting hell because of you! You are to blame! You have not taken the word of Jesus Christ to my islands. We hunger for the word. We are thirsty for the word. We die for the word. Are you, in your indifference, going to keep the word from us forever? Is there no man here tonight who will rise up and say to me, ‘Keoki Kanakoa, I will go with you to Owhyhee and save three hundred thousand souls for Jesus Christ’?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The gigantic man paused. In deep and honest grief his voice broke. President Day poured him a glass of water, but he brushed it aside and called, through choking sobs, “Will no one go with me to save the souls of my people?” He sat down, quaking in his chair, a man shattered by the revelation of God’s word, and after a while President Day led him away.</p>

  <p class="normal">The impact of Keoki Kanakoa’s missionary sermon struck the roommates Hale of divinity and Whipple of medicine with stunning force. They left the lecture hall in shocked silence, brooding upon the misery depicted by the Owhyheean. In their room they did not bother to relight the lamp, but went to bed in darkness, weighed down by the indifference with which Keoki had charged them. When the awfulness of this indifference finally penetrated his conscience, Abner began to weep—for he had grown up in an age of weeping—and after a while John asked, “What is it, Abner?” and the farm boy replied, “I cannot think of sleep, seeing in my mind those human souls destined for all eternity to everlasting hell.” From the manner in which he spoke, it was evident that he had been watching each separate soul plunge into eternal fire, and the misery was more than he could bear.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple said, “His final call keeps ringing in my ears. ‘Who will go to Owhyhee with me?’” To this Abner Hale made no reply.</p>

  <p class="normal">Long after midnight, when the young doctor could still hear his roommate sobbing, he rose, lit the lamp, and began dressing. At first Hale pretended not to know what was happening, but finally he whipped out of bed and caught Whipple by the arm. “What are you going to do, John?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to Owhyhee,” the handsome doctor replied. “I cannot waste my life here, indifferent to the plea of those islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But where are you going now?” Hale asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To President Day’s. To offer myself to Christ.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment’s hesitation while the doctor, fully dressed, and the minister, in nightgown, studied each other. It was broken when Abner asked, “Will you pray with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the doctor said, and he kneeled beside his bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, at his, prayed: “Father Almighty, tonight we have heard Thy call. From the starry wastes of the sky Thy voice has come to us, from across the boundless deep where souls rot in evil. Unworthy as we are to serve Thee, wilt Thou nevertheless accept us as Thy servants?” He continued for several minutes, issuing a prayer to a distant, living, full-bodied, vengeful yet forgiving God. If at that moment he had been asked to describe the Being to Whom he prayed he would have said, “He is tall, rather thin, with black hair and penetrating eyes. He is very serious, marks every transgression, and demands all humans to follow His precepts. He is a stern but forgiving Father, a harsh but just disciplinarian.” And he would have described Gideon Hale in exactly the same terms. If anyone, at the end of his summary, should have asked, “Does this Father ever smile?” the question would have astonished young Abner as one he had not yet considered, but upon careful reflection he would have answered, “He is compassionate, but He never smiles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the prayer was ended John Whipple asked, “Are you coming with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but shouldn’t we wait till morning to speak with President Day?”</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,’ ” the young doctor quoted, and Hale, acknowledging the aptness of this admonition, dressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was four-thirty when they knocked at President Day’s door, and with no visible surprise he admitted them to his study, where he sat in coat and muffler hiding his nightgown. “I surmise that the Lord has spoken to you,” he began gently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are offering ourselves for Owhyhee,” John Whipple explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you considered this grave step?” Day asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have often discussed how we should spend our lives in God,” Abner began, but he was taken by a fit of weeping, and his pale young features became red and his nose runny. President Day passed him a handkerchief.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some time ago we decided to dedicate our lives to God,” Whipple said forcefully. “I stopped smoking. Abner wanted to go to Africa to rescue souls, but I thought I would work among the poor in New York. Tonight we realized where it was that we really wanted to go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is not then the decision of the moment?” President Day pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Abner assured him, sniffing. “My decision goes back to Reverend Thorn’s sermon on Africa three years ago.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you, Mr. Whipple? I thought you wanted to be a doctor, not a missionary.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I vacillated for a long time between medicine and seminary, President Day. I chose the former because I thought I could serve God in two capacities.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The president studied his two able students and asked, “Have you prayed on this grave problem?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And what message did you receive?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That we should go to Owhyhee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good,” Day said with finality. “Tonight I was inspired to go myself. But my work remains here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall we do now?” Whipple asked, as spring dawn came over the campus.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Return to your rooms, say nothing to anyone, and on Friday meet with the committee of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will they be here so soon?” Abner gasped in obvious delight.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. They have found that they are often needed after Keoki Kanakoa speaks.” But noticing the joy in the young men’s faces he warned, “Reverend Thorn, the leader of the group, is most adroit in uncovering young men who are guided by emotion and not by true dedication to Christ. If yours is not a profound commitment strong enough to sustain you for a lifetime, don’t waste the time of Eliphalet Thorn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are committed,” Abner said firmly, and the two young men bade their president good night.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Friday, John and Abner peered from behind curtains as the committee from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions gravely marched into Yale to hold sessions with various young men whose imaginations had been captured by Keoki Kanakoa. “That’s Reverend Thorn,” Abner whispered as the leader appeared. He was a tall, thin man, in a frock coat that reached his ankles and a black beaver hat that stretched far in the opposite direction. He had bushy black eyebrows, a hooked nose and a forbidding chin. He looked like a judge, and the two young scholars were afraid.</p>

  <p class="normal">But John Whipple’s fear was misguided, for he had an easy time when he faced Eliphalet Thorn. The intense, gaunt face leaned forward, while the four lesser ministers listened, and Whipple heard the first kindly question: “Are you the son of Reverend Joshua Whipple, of western Connecticut?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” John replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Has your father instructed you in the ways of piety?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He has.” It was apparent that the committee recognized Whipple for what he was: a forthright, appealing, quick-witted young doctor from a God-fearing rural family.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you experienced conversion?” Reverend Thorn asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I was fifteen,” John said, “I became much concerned about my future, and I vacillated between medicine and the clergy, and I chose the former because I was not certain in my heart that I understood God. I did not feel myself a pious youth, even though my father so reported me to the church. And then one day as I was trudging home from school I watched a whirling-broom of dust as it became larger and larger, and I am certain that I heard a voice say to me, ‘Are you prepared to serve Me with your life?’ and I said, ‘Yes.’ And I shook as I have never shaken before and the cloud of dust hovered about me for some time, but did not get into my nostrils. From that time on I have known God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The five austere clergymen nodded approval, for this kind of sudden discovery of God had grown commonplace in New England, following the Great Awakening of 1740, and no man could guess how another would experience conversion, but Reverend Thorn bent his icy face forward and asked, “If you were originally confused, Mr. Whipple, between medicine and clergy, and if your confusion rose from the fact that you were not certain that you knew God, why, after God spoke directly to you, did you not change your decision and study for the ministry?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was perplexed by this problem for a long time,” Whipple confessed. “But I liked medicine and I concluded that as a doctor I could serve God in two capacities.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s an honest answer, Mr. Whipple. Return to your studies, and you will receive a letter from us within the week.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When John Whipple left the interview he was in a state of such exaltation that he neither looked at his roommate nor spoke to him. In fact, it was the most completely sublime moment in his life up to then and the one in which he felt closest to God. He had committed himself totally to God’s work and he was certain that no power on earth could ever divert him from that commitment. Without speaking, he told his roommate that he had been accepted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner Hale had an entirely different experience with the committee, for when he appeared with his ill-fitting suit, his stringy blond hair pasted down, his sallow face flushed and his pinched shoulders bending forward too eagerly, one of the more worldly of the ministers asked himself, “Oh Lord, why dost Thou choose for Thy work such mangy men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you converted?” Reverend Thorn asked impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abner said, but his explanation grew long-winded and turgid. He spent a good deal of time explaining just where the meadow was and how it lay in relation to the milking shed. But there was no doubt that he personally knew God.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why do you wish to serve as a missionary?” Reverend Thorn asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because ever since my conversion I have been determined to serve the Lord,” Abner affirmed hastily, too eager to convince, and it was apparent to the other members of the committee that the young man was making a bad impression on Thorn, who was chairman because he had done work in Africa and knew the problems faced by missionaries. After a previous meeting with would-be missionaries from Williams College he had told his committeemen, “The type of man we must avoid is the unbalanced young gentleman who is so certain of his personal relationship with God that he refuses to accept his subordinate role in the mission community at large. If we can weed such excitable men out now, we will save the mission much expense in money and confusion later.” It was apparent that he was about to do some weeding, for he interrupted Abner’s flow of piety and pointed out: “I asked you why you wanted particularly to be a missionary. You haven’t explained.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I always wanted to serve God,” Abner repeated, “but I did not know that I was called to the mission field until the night of August 14, 1818.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What happened then?” Reverend Thorn asked impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You spoke on Africa, at the Congregational Church of Marlboro, Massachusetts. I date my true awakening from that night.” Eliphalet Thorn dropped his head and pinched his long nose, wondering what to ask next.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What particularly did Reverend Thorn say that impressed you?” the worldly minister inquired waspishly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is easy to answer that, sir, because ever since, his words have lived in my heart as an ideal. He spoke of the mission in Africa and said, ‘We were as one family in Christ, each contributing his gifts each dedicating himself to the common cause of saving souls.’ From that night I started to train myself to become a member of such a family in Christ. I have learned to saw straight and to build, against the day when I was sent where there were no houses. I’ve taught myself to sew and to cook, and to keep accounts. From the time Reverend Thorn spoke I have never thought of myself only as a college student or as a seminary scholar. I have been in solemn training to become one humble member of a family sent to some far place to serve Christ.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young man’s statement was so unexpectedly contrite and so choked with the spirit of Christ’s discipleship that even the worldly minister who had earlier classified Abner as mangy, which he decidedly was, awoke to his possibilities. “One of the members of the faculty,” this minister said, gracefully concealing President Day’s name, “has reported to us, Mr. Hale, that you are vain of your sanctity.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Abner confessed bluntly, “and I know I must fight against it, but none of my brothers or sisters are pious. Most of the young men here at Yale are not. From these comparisons I did acquire a sense of vanity. I said, ‘The Lord has chosen me, but not those others.’ I am ashamed that even my teachers saw this failing in me, But, sir, if you ask them again, I think you will find that they were speaking of me as I used to be. I have repeated over and over again the text, ‘Every one that is proud in heart is an abornination to the Lord,’ and I have taken it to heart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn was deeply impressed by the changes that seemed to have taken place in this young minister’s character, for Abner’s reference to August 14, 1818, awakened in the older man vivid reflections. He well remembered that meeting, for he had reported on it to his companions in Boston: “I spent the evening addressing a group in Marlboro, and I was distressed by the smug indifference of these well-stuffed farmers from their well-stuffed farms. I might as well have been preaching to their cattle, for all they understood of missionary zeal.” Yet in that indifferent audience there had been one sallow-faced youth acquiring the dedication which now brought him before this committee. The coincidence was too great, Reverend Thorn thought, and on the sudden he saw Abner not merely as a stringy-haired, pasty-faced young man with obvious tendencies toward identifying himself with God, but as a heaven-sent answer to a most pressing problem within the Thorn family. So the leader of the committee of inquiry leaned far forward and asked, “Mr. Hale, are you married?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no, sir!” the young man replied with what could have been interpreted as distaste. “I have never sought the companionship . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were you aware that the Board will send no minister abroad who is not married?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, sir. I told you that I had learned to sew and cook . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn pressed his inquiry. “Do you perchance know some dedicated young female, someone who has experienced conversion, who has thought of going . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, sir. I know no females.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn appeared to sigh with relief and indicated that he had no further questions, but after the committee had advised Abner to wait at Yale for a week, pending their decision on his case, their leader made a slight correction: “It may take us longer than a week to discover our minds in your case, Mr. Hale. Don’t become impatient.” And after the young man had returned to his room, somewhat dazed by the complexity of the questions he had been asked, he found worse confusion, for his roommate reported how relatively simple his examination had been.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They asked me a few questions about my faith,” John Whipple recounted, “and then told me to get married as soon as the letter arrived next week.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whom will you marry?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My cousin, of course.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Butyou’ve never spoken to her!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will. Whom will you many?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The committee treated me much differently,” Abner confessed. “I really don’t know what was in their minds.</p>

  <p class="normal">A knock came at the door, and when Whipple answered it, towering Reverend Thorn, his Adam’s apple dancing, said, “Will you please excuse us, Mr. Whipple?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please sit down, sir,” Abner stammered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall only be a moment,” the gaunt reverend replied, and then with the directness for which he was noted, asked, “I wish to verify my report. I understand that if the Board nominates you for Hawaii, you know of no young female whom you could invite . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was appalled at the idea that his careful life’s plan should be frustrated in the bud because he knew no girls, so he said quickly, “Reverend Thorn, if that’s all that’s going to keep me … Reverend, I know I could ask my father . . . He’s a very strong judge of character, sir, and if he picked a girl . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mr. Hale, please. I didn’t say that you would be forbidden to go. I didn’t even say that you could go in the first place. I merely asked you, ‘If we select you, do you know some appropriate female whom you could marry . . . well, rather promptly?’ And you said no. All right.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But, Reverend Thorn, if you would give me only two weeks,” Abner pleaded, near tears, “I know my father . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am much impressed with your piety, Mr. Hale,” the older man began, on an entirely new tack.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then there’s a chance?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I wanted to speak to you about, Abner,” said the tall, stern man in as kindly a manner as he could command, “is the fact that my sister in Walpole happens to have a daughter . . .” He paused in some embarrassment, hoping that Abner would anticipate his message and make its full delivery unnecessary. But honest Abner, with his hair pasted flat over his temples, could not imagine why the forbidding missionary was speaking of his sister, or his sister’s daughter, and he looked with disarming innocence at Reverend Thorn, waiting for him to proceed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall missionary swallowed his Adam’s apple several times and wiped his forehead. “So if you know of no young female . . .” he began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sure my father could find one,” Abner interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And if the Board selects you . . .” Eliphalet Thorn doggedly continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I pray it will!” Abner cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was wondering if you would entertain it kindly if I were to speak to my niece on your behalf?” The tall reverend swallowed heavily and stared at the sallow young man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner gaped, then blurted, “You mean that you would help me to find a wife? Your own niece?” He thrust his hand out eagerly and pumped Reverend Thorn’s for almost a minute. “That would be more than I dare ask,” he cried joyously. “Really, Reverend Thorn . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Withdrawing his hand, the gaunt missionary interrupted the effusive flow and added, “Her name is Jerusha. Jerusha Bromley. She is a year older than you, but a most devout young woman.”&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">The mention of a specific name, and attributing to that shadowy name a corporeal being with a given age, quite overcame Abner and he started to weep, but quickly he mastered himself and said, “Reverend Thorn, too much has been happening today. Could we pray?” And in the small room at Yale College the experienced missionary and the emotional boy stood with their heads raised to heaven as Abner prayed: “Dear gentle and supervising Lord, I am unable to comprehend all that has occurred today. I have talked with Thy missioners, and they have said that perhaps I may join them. One of Thy servants has volunteered to speak to a young female of his family on my behalf. Beloved and powerful God, if these things come to pass through Thine aid, I shall be Thy servant to the end of my days, and I shall carry Thy word to the farthest islands.” He dropped his head in humility and Reverend Thorn breathed a husky “Amen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will take about two weeks,” he said as he left.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tact was something Abner Hale would never have. “John Whipple said that he would know within a week,” he reminded the committeeman.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your case is different,” Thorn replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Abner demanded.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn wanted to blurt out the truth: “Because you’re an offensive, undernourished, sallow-faced little prig, the kind that wrecks any mission to which he is attached. There’s not a man on my committee that really thinks you ought to be sent overseas, but I have a niece who has got to get married one of these days. And maybe if I can talk to her before she sees you, possibly I can force her into marrying you. That, young man, is what requires two weeks.” Instead, with the self-control he had acquired in Africa, the sagacious minister recovered quickly and offered what he considered a rather clever explanation: “You see, Mr. Hale, Dr. Whipple will be going to Owhyhee as missionary doctor. If we accept you, and if you can find a bride, you will be going as an ordained minister. That’s why your case requires more careful investigation.” The answer was so reasonable that Abner accepted it at once, and when John Whipple received his letter of acceptance and immediately dispatched both an acknowledgment to-the Board in Boston and a proposal of marriage to his cousin in Hartford, Abner smugly smiled at his roommate’s excitement, repeating over and over to himself the reassuring thought: “Anyone can be a missionary doctor. But to be a fully ordained minister requires careful investigation.” But whenever he indulged in this vanity he invariably recalled his Biblical antidote and he recited this, too: “Every one that is proud in heart is an abornination to the Lord,” after which he recalled the powerful word from Job: “Behold every one that is proud, and abase him. Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low.” Thus his two natures warred.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>REVEREND THORN</span>, as soon as his interrogations at Yale College were completed, hurried back to Boston and caught the stage running out to Marlboro, Massachusetts, to make inquiries as to the character and prospects of Abner Hale. Even as the coach neared Marlboro, he felt his old distaste for the village returning. The smug white barns in the smug spring landscape bespoke generations of thrifty, cautious people, proud of their possessions and deaf to the teachings of the Lord. His earlier impressions were fortified when he found the townspeople as smug as the outlying barns.</p>

  <p class="normal">The school principal reported, airily: “Abner Hale! Ah, yes! There are so many Hale children it’s rather difficult to keep them separated in one’s mind. Abner, stringy hair, no good in games, worse in math, but rather gifted in the verbal processes that mark the cultivated mind. An austere young man who never pared his nails. Had good teeth, though.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was he pious?” Thorn pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To a fault,” the airy schoolteacher replied. Then, sensing that this could be construed by his visitor to be a slur against piety, he quickly added, “By that I mean he was inclined toward priggishness, which I hold to be a fault, for does not the Bible counsel us: ‘Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor’?” And he held his hands up and smiled ingratiatingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would he make a good missionary?” Thorn asked in some anger, for he had been unable to follow the Biblical citation.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, yes!” the teacher cried. “To plunge into the unknown. To carry the good Word to the heathen. Yes, I think Abner Hale . . . Do I have the right boy? He was Gideon Hale’s oldest? Bad complexion . . . really, an unlovely child? Yes, that’s the one. Oh, yesl He’d make a fine missionary. Likes odd places and being alone.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The local minister was no better, and Reverend Thorn, schooled in the hard fields of Africa, could quickly spot where Abner had learned to weep. The doddering old man wheezed: “Little Abner Hale! I remember the year he found the Lord. It was in his father’s meadow, and he stood transfixed . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would he make a good missionary?” Thorn interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Missionary!” the old man snapped. “Why should he leave Marlboro? Why not come back here and take my place, where he could do some good? Somebody ought to send some missionaries to Marlboro. Atheism, Deism, Unitarianism, Quakerism. Pretty soon there won’t be a decent follower of John Calvin in all New England. If you want my opinion, young man, and I can see by your red face that you don’t, you oughtn’t to be coming here seducing our young men to go to Ceylon and Brazil and such places. Let ‘em stay here and do some missionary work. But I haven’t answered your question. Abner Hale’d make a wonderful missionary. He’s gentle yet obstinate in the right. He’s hard-working yet poetic in his love of nature. He’s pious and he respects his parents. He’s much too good to be sent to Ceylon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the dusty walk to the Hale farm, Reverend Thorn just about decided to give up his complex plan of first convincing the Board that they ought to take Abner and then convincing his niece Jerusha that she should do the same. All he had so far heard about the boy confirmed his committee’s suspicions that Abner was a difficult, opinionated young man who was bound to cause trouble wherever he went, but then the gaunt missionary came upon the home of Abner Hale, and his mind was quickly changed.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the road a line of maples led along a narrow lane to a wandering New England farmhouse with barn attached. For nearly a hundred and fifty years the buildings had known no paint and now stood grayish brown in the New England sun, which instead of brightening what could have been a lovely grassed-in square served instead to underscore the bleakness of the buildings. It was, recalled Reverend Thorn, the kind of Christian house in which he had been raised, the archetype in which to produce true piety. He understood Abner better from having seen merely the harsh outlines of his home.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gideon Hale, angular and hard, completed the picture. Wrapping his skinny left leg completely around his right, so that one ankle locked into the other, he put his guest at ease by saying, “If you take Abner for Owhyhee you aren’t getting an unmixed blessing, Reverend Thorn. He’s not an average boy. He’s not too easy to handle, either. He was pretty reasonable until he found conversion. Then he was certain that it was he and not me that was to interpret God’s will. But he has enormous character. If you saw his marks in the Marlboro School, you’d find he started out poor in figures. But have you seen what he accomplished at Yale College? Only the best. In many ways he’s an indifferent boy, Reverend Thorn, but where the right is concerned he’s a rock. All my children are.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At supper Eliphalet Thorn saw the kind of granite from which Abner had been hewn. The nine little Hales, with no dirt on their faces and dressed in the cheapest kind of homespun, filed dutifully in and sat at a table marked by spotless cleanliness and very little food. “We will say prayers,” wiry, hawk-eyed Gideon announced, and all heads were bowed. One by one the nine children recited appropriate verses from the Bible, after which Mrs. Hale, an almost dead bundle of bones, mumbled briefly, “God bless this house,” which was followed by a five-minute prayer from her husband. These preliminaries over, Hale said, “And now will our guest consent to bless us with a word of prayer?”. And the scene was so reminiscent of his own childhood that Reverend Thorn launched into a ten-minute blessing in which he recalled the pious highlights of his youth in a Christian family.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the meager meal Gideon Hale took his entire brood into the front room, where a particularly dank smell proved that no fire was ever wasted, and he proposed formal evening prayers. His wife and daughters led in a spirited version of “All hail the power of Jesus’ name,” after which Gideon and the boys sang a hymn quite popular at the time: “Oh, for a closer walk with God.” When they came to the stirring verse about idols, Reverend Thorn joined in forcefully, for the words could almost serve as the dominant motive of his life:</p>

  <p class="normal">“The dearest idol I have known, Whate’er that idol be, Help me to tear it from Thy throne, And worship only Thee.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Prayers by Gideon and his oldest boy followed, then an invitation to the visitor to say a few words. Reverend Thorn spoke long and passionately of the influence a Christian home can have upon a young man, or, as he remembered his sisters and the strong women into which they grew, upon a young female. “It is from homes like this,” he said, “that God picks those who are to carry forward His work on earth.” And in the fullness of his talk he committed himself to sponsoring Abner Hale, for he knew then that while it must be granted that the young man was unpleasant now, in the future he was going to be a great and solid implement of the Lord.</p>

  <p class="normal">When prayers were ended, and the children dismissed, the reverend asked Gideon for a sheet of paper on which to report to the Board. “Will it be a long letter?” Gideon asked anxiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A short one,” Eliphalet replied. “I have happy news to report.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Gideon, therefore, prudently tore his letter paper in half and handed his visitor one portion. “We waste nothing here,” he explained, and as the tall missionary began his letter: “Brethren, I have visited the home of Abner Hale and have found that he comes from a family totally dedicated to God …” he happened to look at the narrow shelf where books were kept, and he saw with pleasure that they much resembled the books his family had collected—a battered copy of Euclid, Fox’s Book of Martyrs, a speller of Noah Webster’s, and a well-worn edition of John Bunyan standing beside a family Bible. “I see with some pleasure,” Reverend Thorn interrupted, “that this Christian family does not surrender to loose poetry and the novels which are becoming so popular in our land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This family is striving toward salvation,” Gideon replied bleakly, and the thin-faced missionary finished the letter which would send Abner Hale to Owhyhee.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Ehphalet Thorn stepped into the cool spring air, Mr. and Mrs. Hale accompanied him to the bright road that shimmered in moonlight. “If it were raining,” Gideon said, “or if there were no moon, I’d saddle the horses . . .” Instead, he pointed the way to Marlboro with his powerful right arm. “It’s not far,” he assured his guest.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn bade the couple good night and started off toward the dim lights of Marlboro, but after he had gone a short distance he stopped and turned to survey once more the bleak and arid home from which his proteg6 had come. The trees were in line; the fields were well trimmed; the cattle were fat. For the rest of the farm, one could see only penury, a complete lack of anything relating to beauty, and an austerity of purpose that was positively repellent, except that it so obviously called to the passer by: “Here is a home that is dedicated to God.” And as if to underline that fact, it was less than two hours after Reverend Thorn’s departure that Abner Hale’s oldest sister rushed weeping into her mother’s room and stood trembling in the moonlight, crying, “Mother! Mother! I was lying awake thinking of the poor Africans about whom Reverend Thorn spoke tonight, and I began to shake, and I heard God’s voice speaking directly to me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you have a sense of overwhelming sin?” her mother asked, slipping into a long coat which she used as a night wrap.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes! I saw for the first time that I was hopelessly and utterly damned and that I had no escape.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you felt willing to surrender yourself totally to God?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was as if a great hand were shaking me, violently, bringing me to my senses at last.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Gideon!” the girl’s mother cried in ecstasy. “Esther has been initiated into a sense of sin!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The news was more pleasing than any other that Gideon Hale could have heard, and he cried, “Has she entered into a state of grace?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She has!” Mrs. Hale cried. “Oh, blessed Beulah Land, another sinner has found you!” And the three Hales knelt in the moonlight and gave ardent thanks to their bleak and forbidding Protector for having disclosed to still another member of their family the remorseless weight of sin under which mankind lives, the nearness of the inextinguishable fires to which ninety-nine out of every hundred human beings are forever and hopelessly committed, and the joyless, bitter path of salvation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Within three days Reverend Thorn approached one of the most gracious villages ever to have developed in America: the tree-lined, white-clapboarded, well-gabled village of Walpole, near the Connecticut River in southwestern New Hampshire. It was a village to gladden the heart, for its glistening church steeple could be seen from afar, and the rolling hills that surrounded it were prosperous. It was to Walpole that Reverend Thorn’s older sister Abigail had come when she had stubbornly insisted upon marrying the young Harvard lawyer, Charles Bromley, whose family had lived in Walpole for several generations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn had never approved of either the Bromleys or their village, for both bespoke good living rather than piety, and he rarely approached Walpole without a definite feeling that God must one day punish this sybaritic place, a conviction which deepened when he neared the Bromley home, a handsome, large, white three-storied house with many gables. He could hear, with some dismay, his sister playing English dances on the family organ. The dance terminated abruptly and a bright-faced, round-cheeked woman of forty rushed to the door, crying, “It’s Eliphalet!” He, avoiding her kiss and looking about anxiously, was gratified to see that his niece Jerusha was not at home.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, she is!” Abigail corrected. “She’s upstairs. Brooding. She’s doing very poorly, but if you ask me, it’s because she wants to. She refuses to get him out of her mind, and just when time is about to solve the problem, a letter reaches Boston from Canton or California, and she goes into a decline again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you thought of intercepting the letters?” Eliphalet asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Charles would never permit that. He insists that any room which an individual holds within a house is that individual’s castle. And foreign powers, even though they be corrupt, have an inalienable right of communicating with that castle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn was about to say he still could not understand why the Lord did not strike Charles Bromley dead, but since he had been wondering this for the past twenty-two years, and since the Lord stubbornly refused to do anything about it, he left his hackneyed observation unvoiced. What did gall him, however, was the fact that the Lord went out of his way to bless Bromley’s various occupations.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” he said stiffly when his sister asked if he would stay with her. “I shall stop at the inn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why did you come so far?” Abigail asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because I have found an opportunity whereby your daugther may be saved.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jerusha?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Three times I have heard her say that she wanted to surrender her life to Jesus. To work wherever He sent her … as a missionary.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eliphalet!” his sister interrupted. “Those were the words of a young girl disappointed in love. When she spoke thus she hadn’t heard from him for a year.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is in moments of disappointment that we speak our true thoughts,” Thorn insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Jerusha has everything she wants right here, Eliphalet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She wants God in her life, Abigail, and here she lacks that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, Eliphalet! Don’t you dare . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you ever discussed with her the things she has told me?” Reverend Thorn pressed. “Have you had the courage?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All we know is that if she has recently received a letter from him, she’s in heaven on earth and wants to get married as soon as he docks at New Bedford. But if six or seven months of silence have gone by, she swears she will become a missionary and serve in Africa . . . like her uncle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let me speak to her now,” Eliphalet proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! She’s in a fit of depression now and she’d agree to anything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even, perhaps, to the salvation of her immortal soul?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eliphalet! Don’t talk like that. You know that Charles and I try to live good Christian lives . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nobody could live a good Christian life in Walpole, New Hampshire,” he muttered with disgust. “Vanity is all I see here. Look at this room! An organ not used for hymns. Novels. Books of lascivious poems. Money that should be going to missions going into ostentatious decoration. Abigail, a young Massachusetts man, dedicated to God, is about to sail as a missionary to Owhyhee. He has asked me to speak to you regarding Jerusha’s hand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Bromley fell back in her damasked chair, then collected herself and called a servant. “Go fetch Mr. Bromley immediately,” she ordered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did not come here to talk to your husband,” Eliphalet protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is my husband, not God, who is Jerusha’s father,” Abigail replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Blasphemy!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, love!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brother and sister sat in hateful silence until Charles Bromley, rotund, jovial, successful and overfed, came into the room. “Family fight?” he asked robustly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My brother Eliphalet . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know who he is, dear. Just call him Phet.” He laughed and added, “I’ve found in these matters that if you can get the litigants to start off on an informal basis it’s so much better. If you call a man ‘My brother Eliphalet,’ why, out of self-respect you’ve almost got to wind up in court. What r’ya up to, Phet?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A fine young man in the divinity school at Yale College is about to depart as a missionary to Owhyhee . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where’s&#160; Owhyhee?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Near Asia.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Chinese?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. Owhyheean.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never heard of it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And he was much impressed with what I had to say about my niece Jerusha.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How did her name come up?” Bromley asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s humiliating,” Abigail sniffed. “Eliphalet’s going around peddling our daughter. To get her married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think it’s very generous of him, Abby,” Bromley exploded. “God knows I haven’t had much success peddling her. One week she’s in love with a sailor, whom she hasn’t seen for three years. Abby, did that sailor ever even kiss her?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Charles!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the next week she’s in love with God and self-punishment on some distant island. Frankly, Phet, if you could find her a good husband I’d be obliged. I could then spend my efforts on her two sisters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The young man of whom I speak is Abner Hale,” Thorn said stiffly. “Here’s what his professors think of him. I visited his home . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Eliphalet!” his sister protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the guise of satisfying myself as to his Christian upbringing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And was it a good Christian home?” Bromley inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was,” Eliphalet replied. “In every respect.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Charles Bromley paced the handsomely decorated room for several moments, and then said unexpectedly, “If you say it was a good Christian home, Phet, I’m sure it must have been horrible indeed. I can see young Abner Hale right now. Skinny, bad complexion, eyes ruined through too much study, sanctimonious, dirty fingernails, about six years retarded in all social graces. And yet, do you know, as I watch life go past here in Walpole, it’s often those boys who in the long run turn out to be the best husbands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In spite of himself, Reverend Thorn always admired the acuity of his brother-in-law’s mind, so now he added what he had never intended saying: “Charles and Abigail, this young man is all the things Charles has just predicted. But he’s also a dedicated man, extremely honest with himself, and one who is going to grow in grace. I wouldn’t want him as a son-in-law now, but in ten years he’ll be the best husband a woman could have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he as tall as Jerusha?” Abigail asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not quite, and he’s a year younger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mrs. Bromley began to cry, but her gruff husband joshed her. “You know how it is, Phet! This sailor that Jerusha fell in love with . . . Some ridiculous dance here in Walpole . . . He’s a cousin of the Lowells, I think . . . I’ve always thought it was her mother who fell most completely in love that night. These tall men with commanding eyes!” He patted his own rotund belly and coaxed his wife away from her tears.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It amounts to this,” Eliphalet said bluntly. “You have a daughter and I have a niece. We both love her very much. She’s twenty-two, and she grows more confused each day. We must find her a husband. We must help her choose a way of life. I offer both.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And I appreciate the offer,” Charles said warmly. “God knows I’ve been helpless.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you still wish to speak with her, Eliphalet?” Abigail asked, swayed by her husband’s reactions.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Abigail,” her husband interrupted. “This is your problem, not Phet’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is, isn’t it?” Mrs. Bromley sniffed. “But what can I tell her about the young man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Eliphalet, having anticipated this, handed her a neatly written dossier on Abner Hale, including a minute description of the young minister, a transcript of his marks in college, an essay he had written on Church Discipline in Geneva, and a sketchy genealogy of the Gideon Hales of Marlboro, descendants of Elisha Hale of Bucks, England. There was also a separate sheet which indicated that confidential letters could be addressed to John Whipple and President Day at Yale, to several Christian citizens at Marlboro, Massachusetts, and to Abner’s sister Esther on the family farm. Abigail Bromley peeked first at the physical description: “Fine clear complexion but sallow; fine teeth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Bad news she could have taken, but these hopeful comments collapsed her and she sobbed, “We don’t even know where Owhyhee Then she accused her husband of lacking parental love: “Are you willing to send your daughter .</p>

  <p class="normal">“My dear,” Charles said firmly, “the only thing I’m not willing to do is to abandom my child to fits of depression and religious mania in a small upstairs room. If she can find love and a rich life in Owhyhee, it’s a damned sight better than she’s doing in Walpole, New Hampshire. Now you go up and talk with her. I believe she’s in a religious swing of the pendulum this month and she’ll probably jump at the chance of marrying a minister and going to Owhyhee.” Therefore, as a result of Reverend Eliphalet Thorn’s importunate trip to Marlboro and to Walpole, young Abner Hale, sweating the June days nervously at Yale, finally received his letter from Boston: “Dear Mr. Hale: As a result of careful inquiries conducted on our behalf by Reverend Eliphalet Thorn, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions is happy in the will of God to advise you that you have been chosen for mission duty in Hawaii. You and your wife will depart Boston on September first in the brig Thetis. Captain Janders.” There was enclosed a printed list of some two hundred articles that venturing missionaries were urged to carry with them:</p>

  <p class="normal">3 razors</p>

  <p class="normal">compass</p>

  <p class="normal">towels</p>

  <p class="normal">washbasin</p>

  <p class="normal">calash</p>

  <p class="normal">1 parasol</p>

  <p class="normal">3 scissors</p>

  <p class="normal">4 mugs</p>

  <p class="normal">3 chambers</p>

  <p class="normal">1 lantern</p>

  <p class="normal">1 nest Hingham boxes</p>

  <p class="normal">1 pair bellows</p>

  <p class="normal">3 stone jugs</p>

  <p class="normal">1 pair andirons</p>

  <p class="normal">1 crane and hooks . . .</p>

  <p class="normal">There was also a much shorter letter which said simply: “You would be well advised to present yourself in late July at the home of Charles and Abigail Bromley in Walpole, New Hampshire, there to meet their daughter Jerusha, a Christian girl of twenty-two. It occurs to me that you may require some few necessities to make yourself additionally presentable for this important meeting, so I enclose herewith three dollars, which you need not repay me.” This letter was “Eliphalet Thorn, of the African Mission.”</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THESE YEARS</span> of the early 1820’s, there were many young ministers destined for Hawaii who, absorbed in study, found no time to make the acquaintance of marriageable young women and who were unexpectedly faced with the positive necessity of getting married within the space of a few weeks, for the A.B.C.F.M. resolutely refused to send any unmarried men to the islands and advised all such who wished to labor there for the Lord to inquire of their friends to see if a suitable female might be found, and there is no record of failure. Of course, some young ministers were rejected by the first nominees of their friends, but sooner or kter all found wives, “not because the young fellers was handsome, but because New England turns out so danged many old maids. Our best boys is all out to sea.” There was much argument as to whether the decision of the A.B.C.F.M. to reject unmarried men stemmed from understanding of what errors men living alone might fall into; or from specific knowledge of what life in Hawaii was like, and it seems probable that the latter was the case, for many whalers had often returned to New Bedford and Nantucket, if they bothered to come home at all, with faraway tales of generous maidens, endless supplies of coconuts and thatched houses in magnificent valleys. In all seaports one could hear the sad refrain:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“I want to go back to Owhyhee,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Where the sea sings a soulful song,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Where the gals is kind and gentle,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And they don’t know right from wrong!”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">From listening to such songs the Board concluded that, conditions being what they were, it would be prudent to require even young men who lived in a state of grace to take their own converted women with them. More potent however was the conviction that women were the civilizing agents, the visual harbingers of Christian life. The A.B.C.F.M. therefore required females, not only to keep the young missionaries in line, but also because a devoted young wife was herself a missionary of the most persuasive kind. And so the young men scattered over New England, meeting shy, dedicated girls for the first time on Friday, proposing on Saturday, getting married after three Sundays had elapsed for banns, and departing for Hawaii immediately thereafter.</p>

  <p class="normal">But none of these amorous odysseys was stranger than the one conducted by Abner Hale. When he left Yale in early July, duly ordained a minister in the Congregational Church, he was five feet four inches tall, weighed one hundred and thirty-six pounds, had a most sallow complexion, a somewhat stooped bearing, and stringy blond hair which he parted in the middle and pasted down with water, bear grease and tallow. He wore the black claw-hammer coat favored by ministers, had a skimpy cotton stock about his neck, and a new ten-inch-high beaver stovepipe hat which tapered inward about five inches above his head and then flared out to a considerable expanse of flatness on top. In his meager luggage, tied together in a box, he carried a small brush which he had been told to use in grooming his hat, and this was the one vanity of dress he allowed himself, for he reasoned that this hat, more than anything else, heralded him as a clergyman. His cowhide shoes, black with elastic webs, he ignored.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the coach landed him at Marlboro, he stepped primly down, adjusted his tall hat, grabbed his box, and set out on foot for home, To his disappointment, no one in Marlboro bothered to congratulate him on having attained the ministry, for in his tall hat no one recognized him, and he reached the tree-lined lane leading to his home without having spoken to anyone, and there he stood in the hot dust, greeting, as he felt, for the last time, this bleak, unkindly home in which generations of Hales had been born, and it seemed to him so marked with love that he bowed his head and wept. He was standing in this manner when the younger children spotted him and led the whole family out to welcome him home.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had barely assembled in the austere front room when Gideon Hale, brimming with pride at having a son who was ordained, suggested, “Abner, will you lead your first prayer in this house?” And Abner took as his text Leviticus 25:10, “And ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family,” and poured forth a minor sermon. The family glowed, but when services were over, shy, gangling Esther took her brother aside and whispered, “The most wonderful thing has happened, Abner.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Father told me, Esther. I am deeply pleased that you have entered into a state of grace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would be vain of me to speak of that,” the eager girl said, in blushes. “That wasn’t what I meant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What then?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have received a letter!”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was now Abner’s turn to blush, and although he did not wish to display unseemly interest he nevertheless had to ask, haltingly, “From . . .” But he could not bring himself to utter the name he had not yet spoken to anyone. It seemed to him so improbable that he should even know of Jerusha Bromley, let alone be on his way to propose to her, that he would not profane her name by mentioning it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Esther Hale took her brother’s two hands and assured him, “It is from one of the sweetest, most considerate, gentle and Christian young women in all New England. She called me sister and asked for my prayers and guidance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“May I see the letter?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh! No! No!” Esther protested vigorously. “It was sent to me in confidence. Jerusha said . . . Isn’t that a sweet name, Abner? It was Jotham’s mother’s name in Kings. She said that everything was happening so rapidly that she had to confide in a trustworthy friend. You would be amazed at the things she asked me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“About what?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“About you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did you say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wrote a letter of eighteen pages, and although it was a secret letter between my sister and me . . ,”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your sister?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Abner. I’m convinced from the manner of her letter that she intends marrying you.” Esther smiled at her confused brother and added, “So although it was a secret letter, I made a copy of one of the eighteen pages.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because on that page I listed every single one of your faults, as a young woman would assess them, and in sisterly love, Abner, I would like to give you that important page.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would like to have it,” Abner said weakly, and he took the finely composed page, with its flowing penmanship, to his room and read:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dearest Jerusha, whom I hope one happy day to have the right of calling sister, thus far I have told you only of my brother’s virtues. They are many and I have not exaggerated them, for as you can guess, living in close harmony in the bosom of a large and closely bonded family provides even the dullest intellect with ample opportunity to penetrate even the most secret recesses of another’s mind and temperament. Against the day, therefore, when we may meet as true sisters, and desirous of having you judge me as having been completely honest with you in true Christian principle as enjoined by our Lord in Ephesians 4:25, ‘Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another,” I must now advise you of the weaknesses of my devout and gentle brother. First, Jerusha, he is not skilled in pretty manners and will surely disappoint you if you seek them foremost in a husband. That he could learn to be more gracious I feel sure, and perhaps under your patient counsel he might one day become almost civilized, but I doubt it. He is rude and honest. He is thoughtless and forthright, and from having watched my mother deal with such a husband I know how trying it can be at times, but in all of my life I have not seen my father make much change, so I must conclude that this is something which women prize but which they rarely find. Second, he is thoughtless where women are concerned, for I have lived with him in closest intimacy for nineteen years, and I have shared his secrets and he mine, and never in that time has he thought to give me a present other than some useful object like a straight-edge or a journal. I am sure he does not know that flowers exist, even though our Lord saw to it that His temple in Jerusalem was constructed of finest materials and sweet woods. In this also he is much like his father. Third, he is not a handsome young man and his habit of stooping makes him less so. He is not careful of his clothes, nor of his person, although he does wash his mouth frequently to avoid giving offense in that quarter. On any day in Marlboro I see young men who are more handsome than my brother, and I suppose that one day I shall marry one of them, but I have not the slighest hope that this handsomer man will have the list of favorable attributes which I have just enumerated. But I know you will often wish that Abner stood a little straighter, wore linen a little whiter, and had a more commanding presence. He will never have these graces and if you seek them primarily, you will be grievously disappointed. Finally, sister Jerusha, for I make bold to call you this in the most fervent hope that you will accept my brother, for the spirit of joy I find in your letter is one that Abner sorely needs, I must warn you that he is both grave and vain, and if he were not destined for the ministry these would be insufferable traits, but his gravity and vanity spring from the same cause. He feels that God has spoken to him personally, as indeed He has, and that this separates him from all other men. This is a most unpleasant trait in my brother, and I can now say so because God has spoken to me, too, and I judge from your letter that He has come to you, and I find neither in you nor in myself the vanity that mars my brother. I have found in God’s presence a sweetness that I never knew before. It makes me gentler with my sisters, more understanding of my little brothers. I take more joy in feeding the chickens and churning the butter. If only Abner could surrender his vanity in the presence of the Lord, he would be a near-perfect husband for you, Jerusha. As it is, he is a good man, and if you should elect him, I pray that you will keep this letter with you and that you will find as the years pass that your unseen sister told you the truth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was another letter waiting at Marlboro. It came from Reverend Eliphalet Thorn and said simply: “While you’re at your father’s, work each day in the sun with your hat off. If Jerusha accepts you, I’ll perform the ceremony.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So for two weeks Abner worked in the fields as he had as a boy, and in time he grew bronzed and the sallow skin under his deep-set eyes tightened, so that when it came time for him to say farewell to his large and loving family he was as close to being handsome as he would ever be, but the relaxation from grimness that his sister Esther had sought to encourage had not taken place. This was partly because the young minister had a presentiment that this was the very last time on earth that he would see these eleven people, this barn, that meadow where he had known conversion, this warm fellowship of a Christian family. He shook hands with his mother, for he was never much of an embracer, and then with his father, who suggested cautiously, “Since you’re leaving, maybe I ought to hitch up the wagon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was obviously relieved when his son replied, “No, Father. It’s a good day. I’ll walk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to give you a little money to go away with, Abner,” his father began, hesitantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s not necessary,” Abner replied. “Reverend Thorn kindly sent me three dollars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what Esther told me,” Gideon Hale replied. Thrusting out a well-worn hand, he said stiffly, “May the Lord go with you, son.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“May you continue to live in grace,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">He then said good-bye to Esther and for the first time realized that she was growing into quite a fine young woman. He had a pang of regret and thought: “I ought to have known Esther better.” But now it was too late, and he stood in a welter of confusion when she kissed him, thus paving the way for each of his other sisters to do the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good-bye,” he said chokingly. “If we do not meet again here on earth, we shall surely reassemble at His feet in heaven. For we are heirs of God and joint heirs of Jesus Christ to an inheritance uncorrupted, undefiled and limitless and which fadeth not away.” With this he sternly moved away from his bleak parents and their bleak home with its unpainted boards and unlovely windows. For the last time he walked down the lane, out into the dusty road, and on to Marlboro, where the coach picked him up for New Hampshire and an adventure which he dreaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Arrived at the Old Colony Inn at Walpole, Abner washed and took from his papers one that had been written by his sister. Numerous items were set forth, and numbered, the first thing being: “Upon arrival wash, brush yourself thoroughly, and have the messenger deliver this note to Mrs. Bromley: ‘My dear Mrs. Bromley, May I have the pleasure of calling upon you this afternoon at three?’ Then sign your name and the name of the inn, in case one of the family should deem fit to come to escort you in person.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The letter had scarcely been dispatched when Abner heard a hearty male voice crying, “You got a young fellow from Massachusetts staying here?” And before Abner had time to read his sister’s careful instructions for the first visit, his door was burst open and he was greeted by a generously filled-out New Hampshire gentleman who laughed, “I’m Charles Bromley. You must be nervous as a colt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Abner said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You look a lot browner and tougher than everybody said.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend Thorn told me to do some work in the fields.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do me a lot of good to do the same. What I came for, though, was to tell you that we won’t hear of you waiting around this inn till three o’clock. Walk right across the common with me, and meet the family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It won’t be an imposition?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Son!” Lawyer Bromley laughed. “We’re as nervous as you are!” And he started to lead young Hale home, but on the spur of the moment stopped and called to the innkeeper, “What are the charges here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sixty cents a day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hold the bill for me. These young ministers don’t earn much money.” He then took Abner out into the midsummer perfection of Walpole. There was the village church, glistening white in its pre-Revolutionary splendor, the massive houses, the giant elms, the marvelous green common with a fretwork bandstand in the middle where Charles Bromley often delivered patriotic addresses, and straight ahead the lawyer’s residence from which Mrs. Bromley and her two younger daughters peered like spies.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s not as bad as they said!” Charity Bromley whispered to her sister.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s not very tall,” Mercy sniffed. “He’s more your size, Charity, than Jerusha’s.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now be composed, girls,” Mrs. Bromley commanded, and all sat primly in large chairs. The door was kicked open in Charles Bromley’s familiar way, and a young man in black carrying a large stovepipe hat entered the room. He walked firmly across the carpeting, bowed to Mrs. Bromley, and said, “I am honored that you would invite me to your home.” Then he looked at Charity, nineteen and pretty, with curls to her shoulders, and said with a tremendous blush and a deep bow, “I am especially pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss Bromley.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s not Jerusha!” young Mercy squealed, attacked by a furious set of giggles.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Mr. Bromley joined the laughter and said, “You know how girls dawdle, Abner. You’ve got sisters. You’ll know Jerusha when she, comes down. She’s the pretty one.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner felt a wave of paralyzing embarrassment sweep over him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he became aware that Mrs. Bromley had addressed a question to him: “Do you have a sister Mercy’s age? She’s twelve.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have a brother twelve,” he fumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, if you have a brother twelve,” Mercy said brightly, “you can’t very well have a sister twelve, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could be twins,” Charity laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No twins,” Abner explained precisely.</p>

  <p class="normal">“So then he doesn’t have a sister twelve!” Mercy triumphed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What Mrs. Bromley was going to say, Abner,” explained Mr. Bromley, “was that if you did have a sister twelve, you’d understand why we sometimes would like to drown this little imp.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea startled Abner. He had never heard his parents say such a thing, even in jest. In fact, he had heard more joking in these first few minutes with the Bromleys than he had heard in his entire family life of twenty-one years. “Mercy looks like too fine a child to be drowned,” he mumbled in what he took to be gallantry, and then he gaped, for coming down the stairs and into the room was Jerusha Bromley, twenty-two years old, slim, dark-eyed, dark-haired, perfect in feature and with gently dancing curls which framed her race, three on each side. She was exquisite in a frail starched dress of pink and white sprigged muslin, marked by a row of large pearl buttons, not flat as one found them in cheaper stores, but beautifully rounded on top and iridescent. They dropped in an unbroken line from her cameoed throat, over her striking bosom, down to her tiny waist and all the way to the hem of her dress, where three spaced bands of white bobbin lace completed the decoration. Abner, looking at her for the first time, choked. “She cannot be the sister they thought of for me,” he thought. “She is so very lovely.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With firm step she came across the room and offered Abner her hand, saying in a low gentle voice, “The wisest thing I have done in my life was to write to Esther. I feel as if I already know you, Reverend Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“His name’s Abner!” Mercy cried, but Jerusha ignored her.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a long, hot, enchanting afternoon from one o’clock to six. Abner had never before encountered such wit and relaxed laughter, marred only by the fact that upon his dusty arrival at the inn he had drunk enormous quantities of water, so that from four o’clock on he needed more than anything else a chance to go to the privy, a predicament which had never before faced him and with which he was incapable of coping. Finally, Mr. Bromley said openly, “Just occurred to me, we’ve been keeping this young man talking for five hours. I’ll bet he’d like to visit the outhouse.” And he led the blushing young minister to the most enjoyable relief he had ever experienced.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dinner Abner was aware that the entire Bromley family was watching his manners, but nevertheless he felt that he was conducting himself fairly well, a fact which gave him some pleasure, for although he thought it was stupid to judge a man by his manners, he suddenly realized that he wanted this pleasant family to think well of him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We were all watching to see if you took the cherry pits out of your mouth with your fingers,” Mercy teased.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We learned not to do that at college,” Abner explained. “At home I used to spit them out.” The family laughed so merrily that Abner discovered he had made a joke, which had not been his intention.</p>

  <p class="normal">At eight Mr. Bromley asked if Abner would lead evening worship, and he did so, taking for his text one that Esther had selected, aftet much study, for the occasion, Genesis 23:4: “I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” Charles Bromley found the passage excessively gloomy for a beginning preacher of twenty-one but he had to confess admiration for the adroitness with which Abner converted death into a glowing assurance of life. Abner, for his part, held that the manner in which Mrs. Bromley played the organ for hymns and the way in which her three daughters sang them were both unnecessarily ornate. But granting these differences, the service was a success.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Mr. Bromley said, “To bed, family! These youngsters must have much they want to discuss.” And with a wide sweep of his arms he projected his brood upstairs.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they were gone, Jerusha sat with her hands folded, looking at the stranger in her house, and said, “Reverend Hale, your sister told me so much about you that I feel no need for asking questions, but you must have many that perplex you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have one that surpasses all others, Miss Bromley,” he replied. “Do you have unshaken confidence in the Lord?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do. More than my mother or father, more than my sisters. I don’t know how this happened, but I do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am pleased to hear that you are not a stranger to our Lord and Master,” Abner sighed contentedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you no other questions!” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner looked startled, as if to say, “What other questions are there?” But he asked, “Are you willing, then, to follow blindly His grand purpose of life, even if it takes you eighteen thousand miles away from home?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am. Of that I am quite certain. For some years now I have had a calling. Of late it has grown most powerful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know that Owhyhee is a pagan land, barbarous with evil?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One night I heard Keoki speak at church. He told us about the dark practices of his people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you are nevertheless willing to go to Owhyhee?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha sat extremely primly for several moments, fighting down her natural inclinations, but she could not do so, and finally she blurted, “Reverend Hale, you’re not hiring me to go to Owhyhee And you’re not investigating me to see if I should be made a minister! You’re supposed to be asking me if I want to marry you!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From his chair some few feet away, Abner swallowed very hard. He was not surprised by Jerusha’s outburst, for he was aware that he knew nothing of women, and perhaps this was the way they were expected to act. So he did not panic. Instead he looked at his hands and said, “You are so beautiful, Miss Bromley. You are so much more lovely than I had ever a right to expect, that I cannot even now comprehend that you might consent to marry me. I am astonished that you would bother with me, so I have been thinking that you must have some powerful call to the Lord. It seemed safe and reasonable for us to talk about that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha left her chair, walked to Abner and kneeled on the floor so that she could look up into his eyes. “Are you saying that you’re afraid to propose to me, Reverend Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. You are so much more beautiful than I expected.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you’re thinking, ‘Why isn’t she already married?’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend Hale, don’t be embarrassed. All my family and friends ask the same question. The simple truth is, three years ago, before I came to know the Lord, I was in love with a New Bedford man who came here on a visit. He was everything you aren’t, and immediately everyone in Walpole decided that he was a perfect husband for me. But he went away and in his absence . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You used God as a substitute?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Many think so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And now you wish to use me as a substitute, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I imagine that my mother and sister think so,” Jerusha replied quietly. The moment of emotion having passed without Abner’s even having touched her hands, she rose demurely and returned to her own chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yet my sister Esther thought that your letter was sincere,” Abner reflected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when she thought so,” Jerusha said wryly, “she did her best to convince me to marry you. If Esther were here now . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Aloofly, two strange lovers, like continents undiscovered, sat apart, with oceans of uncertainty between them, but as the unique day drew to an end, Jerusha found that Abner Hale really did believe on the Lord and that in his heart he was truly afraid to take a woman to wife who was not wholly committed to God; whereas Abner learned that it was unimportant whether Jerusha Bromley was in a state of grace or not; what counted was the fact that she was willing to remain an old maid forever unless marriage brought her the honest passion of which life was capable.</p>

  <p class="normal">On these mutual discoveries the first interview ended, except at the door to the Bromley home Abner asked quietly, “May I be so bold as to grasp your hand tenderly before I go … as a token of my deep esteem for you?” And when he first touched the body of Jerusha Bromley, spinster of Walpole, in what was for him the most daring gesture of his young life, a surge of such power sped from her finger tips to his that he stood for a moment transfixed, then hurried in confusion across the sleeping common and to his inn.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before eight the next morning all the kitchens of Walpole—at least all whose members attended the local church—knew of the precise state of the Hale-Bromley courtship, for little Mercy had been spying, and now she went from house to house relating breathlessly, “Well, he didn’t really kiss her, because that would have been improper on a first visit, but he did take her hand in his, like in an English novel.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At eight-thirty Mercy and her sister Charity called at the inn and advised their possible brother-in-law that he was about to be spirited away on a family picnic, and he asked impulsively, “Is . . . Miss Bromley attending?” And Mercy replied, “Jerusha? Naturally. How else is she going to become engaged?” But Abner, foreseeing another day spent far from a privy, refused to eat any breakfast or drink either milk or water, so that by the time the picnic baskets were opened on a New Hampshire hill, he was famished and ate prodigiously, after which he and Jerusha went for a walk along a stream, and he asked, “How do you find it possible to leave such a lovely place?” And she replied cryptically, “Not all of those who followed Jesus were peasants.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped by a bending tree and said, “I could not sleep last night, Miss Bromley, thinking that I managed badly in our conversation, but then it seemed that I hadn’t managed so poorly after all, because as a result of our talking I came to know you and to appreciate your qualities. Any fool could see that you were beautiful, so there was no sense talking about that, but in other circumstances we might have said a great deal last night without having discovered as much as we did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What we found out,” Jerusha replied, holding onto a branch, “is that we are both stubborn people, but that we both honor the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Standing more than six feet from her, he asked, “Would you be willing to go to Owhyhee … on those conditions?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would, Reverend Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He swallowed, scratched at the tree trunk and asked, “Does this mean we are engaged?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It does not,” she said firmly, holding onto her branch and swinging back and forth provocatively.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why won’t you marry me?” he asked in great confusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because you haven’t asked me,” she said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I said . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You said, ‘Would you be willing to go to Owhyhee?’ and I said, ‘Yes.’ But that certainly didn’t mean I’d be willing to go all the way around Cape Horn to Owhyhee with a man who wasn’t my husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, I never intended . . .” Abner crimsoned in dismay and tried to make several different apologies, with no success. Finally, he stopped and looked at the slim girl in the silky summer dress, swinging on the bough so that she seemed to be dancing, and without her teasing him more, he discovered what he should say. He left the tree trunk and kneeled in the dust beside the faltering stream. “Miss Bromley, will you marry me?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will,” she replied, adding nervously, “I was so afraid, Reverend Hale, that you were going to say, ‘Will you marry me and go with me to Owhyhee?’ That would have spoiled it all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She held down her hands and helped him to his feet, expecting to be embraced, but he dusted his knees and said in a burst of real joy, “We must advise your parents.” Smiling wryly, she agreed, and they went back to the picnic area, but Mr. and Mrs. Bromley were sound asleep. Mercy and her sister were not, and could guess what had happened, so Mercy asked, “Are you engaged?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Jerusha said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Has he kissed you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not yet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner! Kiss her!” the sisters cried, and in the hot sun of a late July day, Abner Hale kissed Jerusha Bromley for the first time. It wasn’t much, as kisses go, and the audience was nervously distracting, but when it ended he amazed himself by grabbing first Charity and kissing her and then Mercy, and crying, “You’re the dearest sisters in the whole world!” Then he sat down, dazed, and confessed, “I never kissed a girl before but now I’ve kissed three of them!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mercy awakened her parents, screaming, “They’ve done it!” And there were more deep greetings, after which Charity produced a piece of paper on which she had outlined numerous dates: “We can post the banns on Sunday, that’s the fifth, and on Monday the twentieth you can get married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mercy cried, “We’ll turn Daddy’s office into a sewing room and the cloth we’ve bought can be made into dresses and sheets . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve bought the cloth?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Charity confessed. “Three weeks ago Jerusha decided to marry you, after she read Esther’s letter. She told us, ‘We’ll let him come to visit just in case his sister’s a wicked little liar.’ But we all knew she wasn’t. Anyway, Daddy must have got fifteen different letters about you, and we knew.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did all of you read all the letters?” Abner asked in embarrassment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Mercy cried. “And the part I liked best is where you learned to cook and sew and keep house … in case you became a missionary. I told Jerusha to marry you quick, because then she’d never have to do any work at all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But that evening, as the two younger sisters took their new brother-in-law-to-be back to the inn so that he could wash up before supper, Mercy pointed to a large white house and said, “That’s where the sailor came to visit. He was a very handsome man, although I was only nine at the time, so he may have seemed taller than he really was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What happened?” Abner asked cautiously, and he saw Charity pinch her sister’s arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ouch! Charity’s trying to make me keep still, Abner, but I thought somebody ought to tell you. He was much handsomer than you are, but not as nice.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jerusha would never have married him, anyway,” Charity added.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It takes a certain type of girl to marry a sailor,” Charity said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What type?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Salem type. The New Bedford type. Women who are willing to have their husbands away for years at a time. Jerusha is not that kind of woman, Abner. She lives on affection. Do be sweet with her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall be,” he said, and on the marriage morning, when Reverend Thorn arrived by coach from Boston to conduct the ceremonies for his niece, he found his young minister friend from Yale in a state of gentle hypnosis. “I can’t believe that I am going to marry this angel,” Abner exploded, eager for someone to talk with after the three weeks of sewing and parties and meeting friends. “Her sisters have been unbelievable. Eighteen women were at their home all last week making me clothes. I’ve never known . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He showed the tall missionary six barrels of clothing made by the women of Walpole, books donated for the mission in Owhyhee, and crockery. “I have experienced an outpouring of the spirit in this town that I never knew existed,” Abner confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My sister Abigail is a girl who always made friends quickly,” Eliphalet Thorn admitted. “I am so glad that you and Jerusha have found each other in God. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll step along to the house to complete arrangements with Charles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But as he left Abner’s room, the innkeeper called him and said, “If you’re heading for Bromley’s, you can take along this letter which just came in the mail,” and he handed the missionary several sheets of paper folded upon themselves to form an envelope, and it was from Canton, in China, and had been on the sea for many months to London and to Charleston in South Carolina and to New Bedford. It was addressed to Miss Jerusha Bromley, Walpole, New Hampshire, and was written in a strong, fine hand. Reverend Thorn studied the letter for a long time and rationalized: “What chance is there that the innkeeper will mention this letter before Jerusha leaves Walpole? Not very much, I should think. But there is still a chance, so I must not burn it. Besides, to do so would be a sin. But if I now honestly declare, ‘Eliphalet Thorn, you are to deliver that letter to your niece, Jerusha Bromley,’ my intentions will be clear. Then, if I tuck it deep inside my inner pocket, like this, it would be only logical for me to forget it. Three months hence I can post it to my sister with apologies. And with Jerusha already married, why would Abigail want to bother her daughter with such a letter? Abigail’s no fool.” So he hid the letter and said in a loud voice as he walked across the common, “I must give this letter to Jerusha immediately I see her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon Abner Hale, twenty-one, married Jerusha Bromley, twenty-two, whom he had known two weeks and four days, and on the next morning the young couple, accompanied by fourteen barrels of missionary goods, set out for Boston and the hermaphrodite brig Thetis, 230 tons, bound for Owhyhee.</p>

  <p class="normal">The mission party assembled for the first time on August 30, 1821, in a brick church on the Boston waterfront. When Abner and Jerusha entered, John Whipple saw them and gasped with surprise at the beauty of the young woman who stood hesitantly in a fawn-oolored coat and a pale blue poke bonnet that neatly framed her dancing brown curls and flashing eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Amanda!” he whispered to his wife.&#160; “Look at Abner!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that Abner?” the tiny bride from Hartford asked. “You said . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hello, Abner!” Whipple called softly. When the couples met, Whipple said, “This is my wife, Amanda.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is Mrs. Hale,” Abner replied, and they proceeded to meet the other nine mission couples.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of the eleven young men convened in the church, all were under the age of twenty-eight, and nine were less than twenty-four. One had been married for two years, another for almost a year. The remaining nine had been married much as Abner and Jerusha. Friends had dispatched hastily written word pictures of unmarried girls of known piety, and weddings had been abruptly arranged, usually on the first meeting between the young people. Of these nine hurried marriages, only John Whipple and his tiny cousin Amanda had known each other for more than four days before banns were announced. Of the remaining eight couples, six, when it came time to sail, had not yet relaxed sufficiently for husband and wife to call each other by their first names, and that included Reverend and Mrs. Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">Few pilgrims have ever set forth upon great adventure with clearer directions than those promulgated by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in the little brick church. Tall, godlike Eliphalet Thom, drawing upon his hard years in Africa, said bluntly, “Brothers, you are about to immerse yourselves in one of the most difficult of all ventures, mission work in a pagan land. You are severely admonished to abide by these rules. First, all property is to be held in common. You are a family, and as a family you will receive from us here in Boston regular supplies which belong to no man or woman, but to the family in general. If you who are farmers raise fruit and sell the surplus, the proceeds belong to the family. If you who are good seamstresses sew clothing and sell it to the sailors in Owhyhee, the returns belong to the family. You are a family in Christ, and it is as a family that you own your houses, your lands, your schools and your churches.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Second, you are abjured from interfering in the government of the islands, for you must constantly repeat to yourselves the injunction of our Lord as found in Matthew: ‘And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.’ You are specifically abjured from participating in government. You are sent not to govern but to convert. You are directed to accomplish two divine missions: bring the heathen to the Lord and civilize him. How he governs himself is his concern. How he learns to know Christ and the alphabet is your concern, for remember that until he learns to read, he cannot know the Bible and God’s redeeming word. Therefore, to speed this worthy end we are sending with you three full fonts of type, and you are to put into the language of Owhyhee the Holy Bible and such other learning as the Owhyheeans are capable of mastering. Provide them with a written language, and they will glorify the Lord.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Third, there is an inborn inclination on the part of all New England men to trade, and I suspect from the natural abilities which I have found among you as I have studied your careers, that many of you would do conspicuously well in business, but you have been called to serve the Lord, and it is to this business that you must attend. You will receive no salary, and you are expected to earn none. Your sole job is to serve the Lord, and if you do this with all your ability, you will have no vain and idle time for business pursuits.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Finally, you are to lift up the heathen step by step until he stands with you. Within the passage of years the schools you build must be taught by him, and before you leave the scene, the pulpits you erect and from which you deliver the word of God must be filled by him. You are setting forth to save immortal souls for the harvest of God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After Reverend Thorn had taken up questions concerning medical practices to be followed, an elderly, white-haired minister who had worked in many parts of America and in Ceylon spoke briefly. “Brothers in God,” he said simply, “you are not entering upon a limited mission. You are to aim at nothing less than the complete regeneration and salvation of a society. If children now die, they are to be saved. If minds are now ignorant, they are to be enlightened. If idols flourish, they are to be supplanted by the word of Jesus. And if a road is mired and useless, it is to be paved and made straight. If there is among you any man or woman with a hundred capacities, he will find in Owhyhee full outlet for all of them. Spend yourselves in Christ so that in later years it may be said of you, ‘They came to a nation in darkness; they left it in light.”’</p>

  <p class="normal">ON <span>THE LAST DAY</span> of August the mission family was introduced to the ship on which they would live during the six months required for the slow passage to Hawaii. Reverend Thorn led them from the brick church, where they had engaged in morning prayers, onto the dock where a large three-masted ship lay anchored while her cargo of whale oil was being unloaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s a substantial ship,” Jerusha observed to some of the other women. “A person shouldn’t get too seasick on that,” she added hopefully.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s not the mission ship,” Reverend Thorn corrected. “Yours lies ahead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” one of the women gasped as she saw the squat and ugly little brig Thetis. It looked scarcely large enough for a river boat.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are we sailing in that?” Abner asked shakenly of John Whipple.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It says Thetis,” Whipple replied dourly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The brig was almost the smallest two-master that could successfully round Cape Horn at the farthest tip of South America. It was seventy-nine feet long, twenty-four feet wide, and drew only a dozen feet when loaded. Jerusha, upon inspecting it more closely from the quay, confided to Amanda Whipple, “It looks as if it might sink if twenty-two missionaries step aboard.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re free to inspect the Thetis,” a rough voice called, and for the first time they met Captain Retire Janders, a rugged forty-year-old master with a circle of sandy beard that framed his clean-shaven face from one ear, down the jaw line, under the chin and up to the other ear, making him look like a ruddy-faced boy peering through a hedge.</p>

  <p class="normal">As Reverend Thorn led his family aboard he introduced each couple formally to Captain Janders. “The captain has been instructed to look after you on this long and tedious voyage,” Thorn explained. “But his first job is to run his ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you, Reverend,” Captain Janders growled. “Sometimes folks don’t understand that a brig at sea ain’t like a farm in Massachusetts.” He led the missionaries forward to where a hatch stood open, and deep in the bowels of the brig they could see their boxes and books and barrels. “It’s impossible, absolutely and forever impossible for anybody to touch anything that’s down in that hold before we get to Hawaii. So don’t ask. You live with what you can store in your stateroom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excuse me, Captain,” young Whipple interrupted. “You pronounce the name of the islands Hawaii. We’ve been calling them Owhyhee. What is their accurate name?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders stopped, stared at Whipple and growled, “I like a man who wants to know facts. The name is Hawaii. Huh-va-eee. Accent on second syllable.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you been to Hawaii?” Whipple asked, carefully accenting the name as it should be.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You learn well, young man,” Captain Janders grunted. “I’ve sure been to Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s it like?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The captain thought a long time and said, “It could use a few missionaries. Now this hatchway aft is where you come up and down from your quarters,” and he led the twenty-two down a dark, steep and narrow flight of stairs so that each wife thought: “If the boat rolls I’ll never be able to manage this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They were little prepared for what Captain Janders now showed them. It was a gloomy, grimy, ‘tween-decks area twenty feet long—less than the length of four grown men—and fifteen feet wide, out of which a substantial portion had been stolen for a rough table shaped in the form of a half-circle, through the middle of which rose the brig’s mainmast. “Our public living area,” Captain Janders explained. “It’s a mite dark at present but when a stout storm comes along and rips away our sails, we’ll take that extra suit from in front of the portholes, and things’ll be a bit lighter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The missionaries stared numbly at the minute quarters and Jerusha thought: “How can twenty-two people live and eat here for six months?” But the real astonishment came when Captain Janders kicked aside one of the canvas curtains that led from the public quarters into a sleeping area.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is one of the staterooms,” Janders announced, and the missionaries crowded their heads into the doorway to see a cubicle built for dwarfs. Its floor space was exactly five feet ten inches long by five feet one inch wide. It had no windows and no possible ventilation. The wall facing the canvas was formed by the brig’s port side and contained two boxed-in bunks, each twenty-seven inches wide, one atop the other. One of the side walls contained two similar boxed-in bunks.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does this mean&#160; .&#160; . .” Amanda Whipple stammered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mean what, ma’am?” Captain Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That two couples share each stateroom?” Amanda blushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, ma’am. It means that four couples fit in here. One couple to one bunk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was stunned, but Jerusha, faced with a problem, moved immediately toward the Whipples, seeking them as stateroom partners only to find that little Amanda was already telling the captain, “The Hales and the Whipples will take this room, plus any other two couples you wish to give us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You and you,” the captain said, arbitrarily indicating the Hewletts and the Quigleys.</p>

  <p class="normal">The others moved on to receive their assignments while the first four couples, knocking elbows as they stood, started making decisions which would organize their lives for the next six months. “I don’t mind an upper bunk,” Jerusha said gallantly. “Do you, Reverend Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll take an upper,” Abner agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Immanuel Quigley, a small, agreeable man, said at once, “Jeptha and I will take an upper.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Practical Amanda suggested: “On the first day of each month those on top come down below. What’s more important, the bunks along this wall seem longer than these. John, climb in.” And when Whipple tried to stretch out, he found that whereas Amanda was right, and the bunks running along the wall of the ship were nine inches longer than the others, both were too short.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Those who start with the shortest bunks,” Amanda announced, “will switch to the longer ones on the first of each month. Agreed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And the eight missionaries formed their first compact, but long after it was forgotten, the one that Abner was about to suggest would mark the missionaries. Looking at the seven distressed faces in the little room he said, “Our quarters are not large and there will be many inconveniences, especially since four among us are females, but let us remember that we are indeed a family in Christ. Let us always call each other by true family names. I am Brother Hale and this is my wife, Sister Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am Sister Amanda,” the saucy little girl from Hartford promptly corrected, “and this is my husband, Brother John.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Since we are only now met,” Abner countered soberly, “I feel the more formal appellation to be the more correct.” The Hewletts and Quigleys agreed, so Amanda bowed courteously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How’s it look?” Captain Janders called, shoving his head through the canvas opening.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Small,” Amanda replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let me give one bit of advice, young fellow,” Janders said, addressing Whipple. “Stow everything you possibly can right in here. Don’t worry about having space to stand. Pile it bunk-high, because it’s going to take us six months to get out there, and you’ll be surprised how grateful you’ll be to have things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will we get seasick?” Jerusha asked querulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am, two hours after we depart Boston we hit a rough sea. Then we hit the Gulf Stream, which is very rough. Then we hit the waters off the coast of Africa, which are rougher still. Finally, we test our brig against Cape Horn, and that’s the roughest water in the world. Ma’am, what do you weigh now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“About a hundred and fifteen pounds,” Jerusha replied nervously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am, you’ll be so seasick in your little stateroom that by the time we round Cape Horn, you’ll be lucky if you weigh ninety.” There was a moment of apprehensive silence, and Abner, feeling a slight rocking of the ship, was afraid that he was going to start sooner than the rest, but the captain slapped him on the back and said reassuringly, “But after we round the Horn we hit the Pacific, and it’s like a lake in summer. Then you’ll eat and grow fat.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How long before we get to the Pacific?” Abner asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“About a hundred and fifteen days,” Janders laughed. Then he added, “I’ll send a boy in here with a screwdriver. Cleat your trunks to the deck. You don’t want ‘em sloshing about in a heavy sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the missionaries saw the boy in their cramped stateroom, they were both amused and delighted, for he was so tall he had to bend over. “It’s Keoki Kanakoa!” John Whipple cried. There were hearty greetings as the massive Hawaiian explained, “The American Board is sending me home to help Christianize my islands. I’m working for Captain Janders only because I like ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the tiny cabin was finally packed, no floor was visible; there was no place to sit; there was only one solid layer of luggage upon the other, and four bunks so close together that the toes of one missionary couple were only eighteen inches away from the toes of the next pair.</p>

  <p class="normal">Early on the morning of Saturday, September 1, in the year 1821 the mission family assembled on the wharf. Gaunt, God-stricken Reverend Eliphalet Thorn conducted service, crying above the sounds of the port, “Brothers in Christ, I command you not to weep on this joyous day. Let the world see that you go forth in fullness of spirit, joyously to a great and triumphant duty. We who send you upon this mission to far lands do so in joy. You who go must evidence the same exaltation, for you go in the spirit of Jesus Christ. We will sing the mission song.” And in a clear voice he started the anthem of those who venture to far islands:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Go, spread a Saviour’s fame:</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And tell His matchless grace</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the most guilty and depraved</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Of Adam’s numerous race.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“We wish&#160; you&#160; in&#160; His&#160; name</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>The most divine success,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Assur’d&#160;&#160; that&#160; He&#160; Who&#160; sends&#160; you&#160; forth</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Will your endeavors bless.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn then spoke his final word of encouragement: “I have personally helped in the selection of each man in this group, and I am convinced that you will be adornments to the work of Jesus Christ. In storms you will not grow weary, in disappointments you will not question the ultimate triumph of your cause. Through your administration the souls of millions yet unborn will be saved from eternal hellfire. I can think of no better parting hymn than the one which sent me forth on such a mission some years ago:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>‘Go to many a tropic isle</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>On the bosom of the deep</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Where&#160; the&#160; skies&#160; forever&#160; smile</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And&#160;&#160; the&#160;&#160; blacks&#160;&#160; forever&#160;&#160; weep,’</em></p>

  <p class="normal">You are to still that weeping.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Another minister issued a long prayer, not much to the point, and the service should have been ended on this high religious plane, with each of the twenty-two missionaries attentive to Reverend Thorn’s injunction that they show no sadness, but the elderly wife of one of the supervising ministers, upon looking at the pretty young brides about to depart, and knowing that some would die in childbirth in Hawaii and others would waste away and others would lose their grip on reality because of back-breaking work and insufficient food, could not restrain her motherly emotions, and in a high piping voice she began one of the most truly Christ-like of all church hymns. Its old familiar strains were quickly picked up, and even Reverend Thorn, unable to anticipate what was about to happen, joined lustily in:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Blest&#160; be&#160; the&#160; tie&#160; that&#160; binds</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Our hearts in Christian love;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>The&#160; fellowship&#160; of&#160; kindred&#160; minds</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Is like to that above.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">All went well in the first verse, and also in the second, but when the singers came to the succeeding thoughts, one after another began to choke, and at the end all the women in the audience were weeping:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“We share our mutual woes;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Our mutual burdens bear;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And&#160; often for each other</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>The sympathizing tear flows.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">Reverend Thorn, his voice strong and clear to the end, thought ruefully, “Women ought not be permitted to attend leave-takings,” for in the general sobbing that now overtook the congregation he witnessed the collapse of his plans for an orderly departure. Instead of triumphant testimony, the morning had become a sentimental shambles, the victory of common human love over black-coated respectability.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, and not by plan, the morning did end on a note of high religious emotion, for Jerusha Hale unexpectedly moved forward and in her fawn-colored coat and lively poke bonnet stood before Reverend Thorn, saying in a clear voice so that all could hear, “I speak to you not as my Uncle Eliphalet, nor as Reverend Thorn of Africa, but as an officer of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. We place our futures in your hands. The eleven men here take no money with them, only those things required for life on a savage island. It would not be proper for me to take worldly wealth, either, and so I turn over to the Board the small inheritance I received from my loving aunt. It was to have been spent on my marriage, but I have married the work of the Lord.” And she handed Reverend Thorn a packet containing more than eight hundred dollars.</p>

  <p class="normal">Penniless, uninformed, ill at ease with their suddenly acquired partners, but strong in the Lord, the missionaries climbed aboard the brig Thetis, and Captain Janders cried, “Break out the sails!” and the tiny ship flung aloft her nine new sails and began moving slowly toward the open sea. Standing on the port side of the vessel, Abner Hale had the distinct premonition that he would never again see America, and he uttered a short prayer which invoked blessing for all those who lived on that bleak, ungenerous little farm in Marlboro, Massachusetts. If he had been asked at that solemn moment what mission he was setting forth upon he would have answered honestly, “To bring to the people of Hawaii the blessings that I enjoyed on that farm.” It could never have occurred to him—as indeed it never did—that a better mission might be to bring to Hawaii the blessings that characterized the solid white home facing the village common in Walpole, New Hampshire, for although he had said nothing about this to anyone, he could not believe that the levity, the profane music, the novels and the deficiency in grace that marked the Bromley home were in any sense blessings. In fact, he rather felt that in bringing Jerusha onto the Thetis he was somehow saving her from herself.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was now tugging at his arm and saying, “Reverend Hale, I think I’m going to be sick.” And he took her below and placed her in one of the short berths, where she was to stay for most of the time during the first four months. Abner, to everyone’s surprise, proved a good sailor, for although he constantly looked as if he were about to vomit, he ate ravenously and never did.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was he, therefore, who led prayers, did the preaching, studied Hawaiian with Keoki Kanakoa, and frequently took care of eighteen or twenty seasick missionaries. Some of them came ungenerously to detest the wiry little man as he moved briskly among their sickbeds, assuring them that soon they would be up like him, eating pork, biscuit, gravy, anything. And yet grudgingly they had to admire his determination, particularly when Captain Janders began to rail against him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders started with his first mate. “Mister Collins, you’ve got to keep that pipsqueak Hale out of the fo’c’s’l.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he bothering the men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s trying to convert “em.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Those monsters?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s got his dirty little fangs into Cridland. I found the boy weeping last night and I asked him what was wrong, and he told me that Reverend Hale had convinced him that death and eternal hellfire were the lot of everyone on this ship who did not confess and join the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe he’s right,” Collins laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But in the meantime we have to run a ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have the men complained, sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, that they haven’t. Cridland says they sort of like to have the little squirt around. Makes them feel as if someone was interested in ‘em.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll tell him to stay clear of the men,” Mister Collins promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders knew precisely when the message was delivered, for two minutes later Reverend Hale, sputtering with rage, was ‘tween decks, hammering on the half-circle table. “Do I understand, Captain Janders, that I have been ordered not to go into the fo’c’s’l?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not an order. A request.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then you were partner to this request?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you are consciously setting yourself athwart my efforts to save the souls of these forsaken men steeped in evil and abornination?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“These are just good ordinary sailors, Reverend Hale, and I don’t want ‘em upset.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Upset!” Reverend Hale beat the table more loudly, so that all the seasick missionaries could hear the argument, whether they wished to or not. “You call the conversion of an immortal soul to God’s grace upsetting! Captain Janders, there are some aboard this brig who would profit from some upsetting, and I am not referring exclusively to those in the fo’c’s’l.” Thereafter, however, he stayed out of the men’s cramped quarters forward, but he did lie in wait for them as they went about their duties, until Captain Janders had once more to call in the first mate. “Damn it, Mister Collins, now he’s meddling with the men when they’re trying to change sails. Warn him about it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This led to further protests from the missionary, which Captain Janders patiently entertained. Finally Hale cried, “I don’t believe you care, Captain Janders, whether you run a Christian ship or not. The men tell me that you issue rations of rum after a storm. That you never try to get them to take the pledge. Obviously, you try to impede me in every way possible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend Hale,” the captain pleaded, “I’m trying to get this ship to Hawaii. You seem to be trying to get it to Beulah Land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Hale replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The two ports are incompatible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not in God’s eyes, Captain Janders. You’ve forbidden me the fo’c’s’l. Now you forbid me to talk to the men on duty. Are you also going to forbid me the right to conduct Christian services on Sunday?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Reverend Hale, I aim to run a God-fearing ship, and when no ministers are aboard, I conduct services myself. Short ones. I’d be pleased to have you carry on for me. I’m in favor of church, at sea or ashore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, when talking with the first mate, the captain asked, “Why do you suppose it is, Mister Collins, that with all these intelligent young men aboard, and with eleven damned attractive young women, it has to be Hale who is always well enough to eat with us? Why don’t he get sick and his wife come to dinner?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Divine providence is sometimes malign, Captain Janders,” the mate replied. But how malign, he was not to know until Reverend Hale preached his first Sunday sermon on the afterdeck. The Thetis rolled so sorely that no other missionary could appear above decks, but there stood Abner Hale, with a heavy Bible in his left hand, preaching into the winds.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have chosen for my text James, chapter 4, verse 8: ‘Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.’” And he launched into one of the most violent attacks on the moral dangers faced by sailors that the crew had ever heard, for he charged that all who sailed before the mast were peculiarly tempted, that those who led them were apt to be insensitive brutes, that their employers who remained safe at home in Salem and Boston were determind to corrupt their vessels, and that every port they touched harbored instruments of evil that stay-at-home citizens could only dream of. Abner painted the men before him as the blackest, most evil and forlorn group of reprobates in Christendom, and the men loved it. Throughout his fiery sermon they nodded approvingly, and even Captain Janders and the first mate agreed that except in the part where Abner belabored them individually, he was close to the truth. But the result of his sermon was rather the opposite of what Abner had intended, for throughout the rest of the day the young sailors whom he wanted to reach most—for he felt that Janders and Collins were past saving—strutted with extra swagger as if in sudden realization of the fact that they “were among the evilest human beings known.” They had suspected this for some time, and they derived positive pleasure from being told so by an expert. Only Cridland, a pathetic, undernourished boy with an overpowering sense of guilt, caught anything of Hale’s message, and he appeared red-eyed and perplexed as Abner was about to go below, asking, “What must I do to be saved?” And from his question Abner knew that his sermon had been a success.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You must pray. You must study the Bible. And you must try to save the souls of your mates in the fo’c’s’l,” Abner explained. He handed young Cridland his own Bible and said, “You may keep this tonight. I brought along eight seamen’s Bibles, and I’ll give you one at Sabbath service but it is only a loan from God to you. Only when you get some friend in the fo’c’s’l to ask for his Bible, will you have started upon your true salvation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At supper Captain Janders growled, “The mate says he saw your large Bible in the fo’c’s’l, Reverend Hale. I thought it was understood that you were not to annoy the men down there any more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have kept severely to my promise, Captain Janders, but since I am forbidden entrance into that pit of depravity, I feel sure that you will not object to my sending there, as my messenger better able to discharge my obligations than I myself, the holy word of God. If you wish to throw the Bible out of your ship, do so, Captain, and your name will become imperishable in the roll call of mariners.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please, Reverend Hale, don’t preach sermons down here. I only asked if you had violated your agreement to stay out of the fo’c’s’l.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have never violated an agreement,” Abner cried. “Oh, I shall stay out! Never fear! But by next Sunday, Captain Janders, eight of my Bibles will be down there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In spite of their arguments with the difficult missionary, both Captain Janders and Mister Collins were impressed by the fatherly way in which he tended his sick companions. Each dawn he went from one sickbed to another, collecting the night’s slops, hauling them away and bringing fresh water to cleanse lips foul from vomiting. Before breakfast he visited each man and woman and read to them from the Bible. Men who wanted to shave were provided with hot water from the cook’s galley, and women who required fresh linen could indicate to Abner which boxes were to be hauled out and opened. At mealtimes he took to each sick friend those portions of greasy food which had a chance of staying down in retching stomachs. He argued the captain into allowing him to cook up batches of oatmeal gruel for the women. And each evening, no matter how sick the missionaries were, they were hauled out of bed and made to attend divine worship conducted by Abner in the tiny, crowded cabin. If he saw that a man or woman could remain upright only with difficulty, he would conclude his prayer in half a minute and say, “The Lord has marked your presence, Joshua. You had better return to bed.” Then, when the sick had mercifully departed, he would involve the others in long discussions, sermons, prayers, hymns. He was especially fond of one hymn which contained a verse which he held applicable to the Thetis:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>He’ll shield you with a wall of fire;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>With flowing zeal your hearts inspire,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Bid raging winds their fury cease,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And hush the tempest into peace.</em></p>

  <p class="normal">But after the eighth rendition of this hopeful assurance, John Whipple, barely able to stand, said shakily, “Abner, you keep singing that the tempest is going to subside, but it gets worse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When we reach Cape Verde, we reach fine weather for certain,” Abner assured everyone, and as the creaking little ship plunged sickeningly on through the North Atlantic swells, he grew more cheerful and more helpful.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’d make a wonderful cook’s helper,” Captain Janders observed to the first mate one night.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you stopped to think what this cabin area would be like without him,” Mister Collins reflected. “Twenty-one sick missionaries on our hands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was therefore not surprising that long before the storm abated, Abner Hale was recognized by all on board as the unofficial father of the mission family. There were men who were older, and men who were wiser, but he was the one to whom all looked for aid and decision. So, when he announced on the fourth Saturday that the storm had sufficiently abated to hold next day’s service topside, and that all who could possibly do so must attend, there was a general effort to drag bruised and smelling bodies back into some semblance of order.</p>

  <p class="normal">In his own stateroom, Abner kneeled on boxes and assured the four sick women there that when Sunday came, he would do everything required to help them dress and climb topside to worship the Lord. Amanda Whipple agreed, as did the two others, and he laid out their things for them, but Jerusha, after trying to rise, subsided and whimpered, “I cannot even raise my hand, Reverend Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will help you, Mrs. Hale. I have brought you some broth from the meat, and if you will drink this now, by morning you will be stronger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha drank the greasy broth, and only with difficulty kept from throwing it back into the smelly stateroom. “I am so dreadfully ill,” she insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the morning you will be better,” Abner assured her, and while she slept he went aloft under the first stars of the voyage. As he was standing by the starboard railing of the brig, two shadowy forms came to him and he heard Cridland say, “I’ve been talking all week with Mason, sir, and he wants a Bible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner turned in the darkness and saw the indistinct form of a young sailor. “Do you wish to be saved?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do,” the boy replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has led you to this decision?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been listening to the older hands speak of a sailor’s life ashore, and I’m afraid,” the boy whined.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re a wise young man, Mason,” Abner said. “The Lord has spoken and you have listened.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, sir, begging your pardon. It’s been Cridland who’s been speaking. He’s made me see the error of my ways.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tomorrow after service, Mason, I’ll hand you your Bible, when Cridland gets his. But it is only a loan from God to you. To keep it, you must get some friend</p>

  <p class="normal">in the fo’c’s’l to acknowledge God and to ask for his Bible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you say a prayer for us, Reverend Hale?” Cridland begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Lord always provides wisdom for those who seek,” Abner replied. And in the darkness he raised his head to the stars and prayed: “Lord, we are afloat on a great ocean in a little boat. The winds and the storms harass us, but we trust in Thee. Tonight we are only three praying to Thee: a young boy on his first voyage, a sailor who seeks guidance, and a beginning minister who has never had a pulpit of his own. Great Father in heaven, we are insignificant in Thine eyes, but guide us in Thy divine ways. For if we are only three tonight, later we shall be more, for Thy wisdom permeates all things and saves all souls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He dismissed the two sailors and stood for a long time watching the stars and waiting till the midnight hour heralded the first Sabbath on which a substantial number of the missionaries could attend formal service. As the holy day crept across the meridian of night, Abner prayed that the Lord might make this day one of special significance. Then he went below and whispered to his unnerved wife, “My dearest companion, you would not believe what has happened. Tonight two sailors came voluntarily requesting evening prayers. The spirit of God is beginning to permeate this forsaken ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s wonderful, Reverend Hale,” his wife whispered, lest they waken the three other couples who had been sick most of the evening.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And tomorrow our family will celebrate its first holy service,” Abner sighed. “But I forget. It’s already Sunday. I studied where the tarpaulin is to be hung. We’re going to have a very handsome church, Mrs. Hale, on the bosom of the deep.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I won’t be able to go up the stairs, Reverend Hale, but I’ll pray with you,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll be well enough,” he assured her, and he crept into the short narrow berth beside her.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in the morning she was no better, and the sight of little Amanda swaying back and forth on the piled boxes made her more ill, so that when Abner returned from checking all his charges he found his wife not dressing, but lying in bed pale and exhausted. “I’m awfully sorry, Reverend Hale,” she sighed, “but I’ll have to miss service this morning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not at all,” he protested cheerily. “I’ll help you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I’m sure I can’t stand,” she protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, Mrs. Hale . . .” And he forcibly brought her slim legs down onto the boxes and caught her in his arms when she proved unable to maintain her balance. “Some breakfast will strengthen you. Then we’ll have service. You’ll see the sun. And you’ll be fine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In trying to get out of the little heaped-up stateroom she almost fainted, weakness and nausea combining to make her deathly ill, but again Abner helped her and maneuvered her through the canvas opening and on into the cramped and smelly cabin, where Keoki Kanakoa was spreading a breakfast consisting of cold suet beef, mashed beans and watery rice, left over from the night before. Jerusha closed her eyes when the sodden food was placed before her and kept them closed as Abner asked one of the older ministers to bless the day. Then Keoki prayed in Hawaiian, to familiarize the missionaries with the language, and the meal was begun.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha could manage a little hot tea and one bite of suet beef, but the clammy lard in the latter revolted her, and she rose to leave, but Abner’s firm hand caught her wrist and she heard him saying, “A little longer, Mrs. Hale, and you’ll conquer it.” So she sat in agony as the cold lard slipped down into her stomach and nauseated her whole body.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to be sick!” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” he said insistently. “This is our first meal together. This is the Sabbath.” And she fought her rising illness, with the smell of food and two dozen people crowding in upon her nostrils.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was pale when the meal ended, and staggered toward her berth, but Abner refused to let her go, and with his strong hold on her arm, marched her up the stairs and onto the gently sloping deck, where a canvas had been hung to form a rude chapel. “Our first worship as a family,” he announced proudly, but the entire family was not to participate, because one of the older ministers took one look at the slanting deck, rushed to the railing, relieved himself of his breakfast, and staggered white and gasping back to his berth. Abner stared at him as he left, interpreting the poor man’s involuntary actions as a personal rejection of God. He was especially irritated because several of the sailors, who were idling the Sunday morning away by hanging on ropes to catch their first glimpse of the mission family, laughed openly as the distraught minister threw up his breakfast.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’ll be more,” one of the sailors predicted ominously, and his mates laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Services were conducted by Abner, as the only one who was likely to be able to finish them, and the family, resting comfortably under canvas strung from the mainmast, sang as cheerfully as circumstances permitted, the fine old Sunday hymn of New England:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Another six days’ work is done,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Another Sabbath is begun;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest—</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Improve the day thy God has blessed.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">Abner then spoke at some length on various passages from Ephesians, chapter 3. ” ‘For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, . . . That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye . . . might be filled with all the fullness of God.’” He pointed out that the family of love within which they lived was open to all who were willing to confess their sins and work toward a state of grace. He was obviously preaching to two audiences: his brother missionaries, to remind them of the family within which they operated; and the eavesdropping sailors, tempting them to join this family of Christ; but his message to the latter was somewhat destroyed when Jerusha, experiencing a dreadful wave of nausea, tried to stagger to the railing, failed, fell on her knees and vomited over the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Watch out, lady!” a sailor called derisively, but Cridland and Mason, the two young men who were to get Bibles that day, quickly jumped forward, caught Jerusha by the arms and carried her below. Abner, infuriated at the disruption of his charge to the sailors, concluded his sermon in rather a jumble, and turned the prayer over to an associate. He was confused and angry, because he had arranged the entire service so that it would end dramatically with his presentatation of the Bibles to Cridland and his friend, thus symbolically welcoming them into the Lord’s family, but when the time had come to do this, those two were below decks, and Abner was painfully aware that his first major effort had ended like that of so many ministers: looking for a logical place to stop. Finally he had just quit.</p>

  <p class="normal">When service ended, members of the family made a pretense of commending Abner for his sermon, but both the extenders of congratulations and the recipient knew that they were hollow. In an unruly fit of temper and disappointment, Abner started to go below, but he was met at the top of the hatchway by Cridland and Mason, who reported, “Your wife is very sick, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank you,” he replied curtly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The minister who got sick first is helping her,” Cridland said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner started down but Mason stopped him and asked, “Have you our Bibles, sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Next week,” Abner snapped, and was gone. But when he saw his wife, and how ashen white she was, he forgot his own problems and fetched water to wash her perspiring face.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m sorry, my cherished partner,” she said wanly. “I’ll never make a sailor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll get you above decks just a few minutes each day,” he said reassuringly, but even the thought of facing that slanting deck again brought back her nausea, and she said, “I’m going to weigh even less than Captain Janders predicted.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At noon, when the day’s big meal was served, Janders saw with pleasure that seventeen of his passengers were at last able to eat. “On each trip,” he observed, “as we approach Cape Verde, our sick ones get better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we be stopping at the islands?” John Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, if weather permits.” The news was so good that Abner rose from his pork-and-suet pudding and called into any staterooms where sick missionaries lay, “We’ll soon be touching at Cape Verde. Then you can walk about on land and get fresh fruit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“By the way, Reverend Hale,” the captain added, “that was a good sermon you preached today. There is indeed a heritage that the Lord provides those who serve Him, and may we all come into it.” The missionaries nodded their approval of this sentiment, whereupon Janders launched his harpoon: “Seems to me your message got a little tangled up at the end.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since all knew this to be true, they looked at their plates and thought: “Our captain is a clever man.” But Abner looked at him boldly and said, “I count a sermon a success if it contains one good Christian thought in it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do too,” Janders said heartily. “Yours had several.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hope we can all take them to mind,” Abner said piously, but secretly he wished that services could have ended as planned. Then the ship would have heard a sermon.</p>

  <p class="normal">After lunch Captain Janders invited the missionaries to tour the ship with him, and John Whipple asked, “I don’t understand why, if we’re bound west for Hawaii, we sail east almost to the coast of Africa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mister Collins, break us out a chart!” And Janders showed the surprised missionaries how it was that ships wanting to double Cape Horn sailed from Boston on a heading which took them not south for the Horn but far to the east, almost to the coast of Africa. “It’s so that when we finally turn south for the Horn, we can run in one straight line, down past Brazil and Argentina, straight on to Tierra del^Fuego,” Janders explained, and the chart made this clear.</p>

  <p class="normal">^’Are the Cape Verde islands pleasant?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You watch! Some of our boys jump ship there on every trip. We’ll be leaving Verde with a couple of Brava boys as replacements.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While the captain was explaining these things, Abner was on another part of the deck talking seriously with Cridland and Mason, “I did not give you your Bibles today because you did not earn them,” he chided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we had to take Mrs. Hale below decks,” Cridland protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The work of the Lord required you to be present topside,” Abner said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Others could have cared for her, Cridland. Next Sunday I shall give you your Bibles. I am going to preach from Psalms 26, verse 5: ‘I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.’ When I have finished my sermon, I shall hand each of you his Bible.” Then he recalled what he had said earlier and, staring at Mason, asked, “But have you earned your Bible? I thought you were to have brought another soul to God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am about to do so,” Mason reported happily. “I have been reading the tracts you gave us to one of the older men. He had led an evil life, but last trip on a whaler he was swept overboard and was saved only by a miracle. Of late, he has been weeping very much and I shall keep talking with him. Perhaps by next Sabbath . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good work, Mason,” Abner replied, and although another might have thought it strange that the religious ardors of the two sailors were not dampened by their disappointment over the Bibles, particularly when their dereliction arose from their humane treatment of a woman, and she the wife of the minister himself, Abner Hale was not surprised. As he pointed out to the young men: “The Lord is a jealous master. You cannot approach Him at your determination, He tells you when you may come into His presence. And if you have been faithless in even small things, the Lord will wait until you have proved yourself worthy.” For Abner knew that easy salvation was never appreciated; Cridland and Mason already treasured their forthcoming Bibles doubly because they had once failed to attain them.</p>

  <p class="normal">If Abner’s first Sunday sermon was something of a failure, his second was a stunning success, marred only by the fact that his wife Jerusha was unable to witness it. He had got her to breakfast, had forced a little cold pork and rice into her racked body, and had even carried her limply onto the deck, but one look at the wallowing waves put her stomach into gyrations, and she was hurriedly taken below by Amanda Whipple and Mrs. Quigley. The intellectual highlight of Abner’s sermon came when he spent fifteen minutes on the congregation of evildoers that the devil had thrown together aboard the “hamferdite” brig Thetis. Like all the missionaries, he called it a hamferdite, not knowing exactly how to pronounce, spell or define the longer and more accurate word, since it was in none of the mission dictionaries. But according to Abner, few ships that had ever sailed the Atlantic knew such a congregation of evil, and his catalogue of what these sailors lounging idly on deck had perpetrated in their short and unspectacular lives was terrifying. The dramatic climax, of course, came when he announced to his startled missionaries and surprised ship’s crew that God had been at work even in this den of vice and that three souls had already been saved, whereupon he produced Cridland, Mason and a beat-up old whaler with bad legs whose catalogue of sin actually surpassed Abner’s conjectures. Some of the old man’s friends, who had spent time ashore with him in Valparaiso, Canton and Honolulu, expected lightning to play upon the waves when he touched the Bible that Abner extended him. Captain Janders shuddered and said to his first mate, “Mark my words, Mister Collins, you’ll be up there next week.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That Sunday the noonday meal was an unalloyed triumph. Captain Janders said it was one of the best sermons he had ever heard afloat, although he was satisfied that Reverend Hale must have been talking about some other ship, and Mister Collins confessed, “It’s a strange phenomenon, but no matter what the ship, the closer it gets to Cape Horn, the more religious everyone becomes. It’s as if all aboard sensed at last the futility of man in the face of God’s awful power. I’m not sure that I would be even a moderately Christian man, which I hold myself to be, if I had never rounded Cape Horn.” Captain Janders added, “I agree. No man by his own power could accomplish the transit we shall soon face.”</p>

  <p class="normal">No comment could have pleased Abner more, for like all the missionaries he had been contemplating with some dread the trial they would encounter as Cape Horn approached, and although it still lay eight weeks in the future, he felt that he would make no mistake in undertaking reasonable preparations. He therefore said, “I have observed, Captain Janders, that you spend your Sundays reading .. .” He found it difficult to say the word, and hesitated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Novels?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Profane books. I was wondering, Captain Janders, if you would entertain it kindly if I were to give you, from the mission stores, several books of a more appropriate and edifying nature?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Richardson and Smollett are edifying enough for me,” Janders laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But when you have in your care some four dozen souls . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In those circumstances I rely on Bowditch and the Bible . . . in that order.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do I understand that you would not take it kindly . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would not,” Janders said stiffly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The mission family has decided,” Abner said abruptly, having talked with no one of this project, “that starting with today we shall hold both morning and afternoon services on deck, weather permitting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fine,” Janders said. Then, always eager to keep the young minister off balance, he asked, “By the way, how’s Mrs. Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Poorly,” Abner said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I should think you would spend some time with her,” Janders suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do,” Abner snapped. “I pray with her morning and night.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I meant, play games with her, or read her an interesting novel. Would you entertain it kindly if I were to offer you, from my own library, several novels of an entertaining nature?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We do not read novels,” Abner retaliated. “Especially not on Sundays.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In that case, when you do get around to seeing your wife, you can tell her that on Tuesday we’ll land at Brava, and she can walk ashore. It’ll do us all wonders.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha was elated by this news, and on Monday, when the calmer waters in the lee of Cape Verde were reached, she ventured on deck for an hour and the sun diminished her pallor. On Tuesday, when the islands were clearly in sight, she clung to the railing, praying for the moment when she could step ashore, but she was to be sorely disappointed, for a stiff breeze came up offshore, followed by heavy low clouds, and even before the Thetis began to roll in deep troughs, it became apparent that to beat into Brava would be too difficult a task, whereas to run before the mounting storm would carry the little brig so far on its westward heading that any attempt to recover Brava would be wasteful. Nevertheless, Jerusha stood in the rain, praying that some miracle would enable the ship to make land, and it was not until Captain Janders himself passed and said, “We’re going to run before the wind, ma’am. There’ll be no Brava,” that she admitted sorry defeat. Then she discovered that she was very seasick, and began retching at the rail so that Janders shouted, “You, there! Take this poor woman below!”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a gloomy family that met that night in the swaying cabin for a supper of gruel and hard cheese. Half the missionaries were unable to leave their staterooms. The others wore bleak faces in recognition of the fact that a chance to step ashore had been missed, and that no other would present itself for many days. How lonely and mean the cabin seemed as the whale-oil lamp swung in the creaking night, as the latrine smelled up the fetid atmosphere, and as friends retched in new despair. Keoki, corning in with the food, said, “I would like to offer the evening prayer,” and in rich Hawaiian he praised the open ocean as compared to land, for on the former one was required to know God, whereas on land there were many diversions. Therefore, reasoned Keoki, it was better this night to be on the Thetis than to be in Brava.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of all the listeners, only Abner knew enough Hawaiian to piece together the message, and he thought it so felicitous that he interpreted it for the mission family, and then he surprised everyone by standing and uttering his first prayer in Hawaiian. It was halting, but it was the native tongue of the islands, and it helped acquaint God with the strange tongue in which this family was to work.</p>

  <p class="normal">ON THE&#160; <span>FORTY-FIFTH</span> DAY&#160; of the voyage,&#160; Monday,&#160; October 15, the groaning Thetis crossed the equator in brilliant sunshine and on a glassy sea. The first victim was Reverend Hale. Since the day was hot, Captain Janders casually suggested at noon that his passengers ought to wear old clothes, and not too many of them. When he was satisfied that no one was wearing his best, he winked at Keoki, who passed a signal aloft.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Reverend Hale!” a voice cried down the hatchway. “Cridland wants to see you!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner hurried from table, grasped the handrail leading aloft, and swung up the narrow ladder. He had gone only a few yards forward when he was completely drenched in a bucket of sea water thrown down from the shrouds. He gasped, looked about in dismay, and felt his muscles contracting in useless fury. But before he could speak, Mister Collins winked at him and said, “We’ve crossed the equator! Call Whipple!” And Abner was so startled by the experience that he found himself calling, “Brother Whipple! Can you come?”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a movement at the hatchway as Whipple ran into a full bucket of water. “Equator!” Abner giggled.</p>

  <p class="normal">John wiped himself off, then looked up into the shrouds where two sailors were dizzy with delight and reaching for fresh buckets. On the spur of the moment Whipple shouted, “Whales!” and stood back as several passengers from below came storming up the ladder and into their initiation. Soon the deck was choked with laughing missionaries, and Captain Janders announced that the crew would now initiate the sailors who had not yet crossed the line. But when one of the young men who had doused Whipple came up for his diet of gruel, whale oil, soap and grease, John shouted, “Oh, no! I’m to feed this one!” And to everyone’s surprise he leaped into the middle of the fray, got himself roundly smeared with grease, and fed the laughing sailor, whereupon there was great hilarity and the captain ordered all hands an issue of rum, at which point the missionaries solemnly withdrew. An hour later Abner had visible proof of the horrors of ardent spirits, for Keoki Kanakoa begged him to come forward into the fo’c’s’l, where the old whaler who had accepted the Bible had somehow collected six or eight extra rations of grog and was now cursing vehemently and bashing his head into a bulkhead. With some difficulty Abner got him into his foul bunk and sat consoling him. When the man was sober enough to speak coherently, Abner asked, “Where is your Bible?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the box,” the old whaler replied contritely.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This one?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.” Primly, Abner opened the box, ignored the filth and disarray, and lifted out the Holy Book.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some men do not deserve Bibles,” he said sternly, and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend! Reverend!” shouted the sailor. “Don’t do that! Please!” But Abner was already far aft.</p>

  <p class="normal">The strange day ended with a sight of incomparable beauty, for from the west, heading to the coast of Africa, came a tall ship with many sails, out of the sunset, and the Thetis spoke to her and lowered a longboat to greet the stranger, taking mail which could be returned to Boston; and as the longboat prepared to stand off, Captain Janders, in the stern, shouted, “Whipple! They might appreciate prayers!” And John swung down into the boat, and all aboard the Thetis watched as their men rowed into the sunset to visit the strange, tall ship, so beautiful in the dusk.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha was brought on deck, and although she tried to control herself, fell into tears at the sight of this curious meeting of two ships in the first shadows of night. “My beloved companion,” she signed, “it’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Look how the sunset rests on the waters. The sea is a mirror.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Amanda, not wishing to be alone at such a still moment, came to stand with the Hales and whispered, “It was almost unbearable, to see Brother Whipple rowing away like that. It’s the first time we’ve been separated. He has been my dear companion and close friend. How lucky we are to be spending our first days of marriage like this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the longboat returned to the Thetis, and when the tall ship had resumed its passage, with night upon it and the noiseless sea, Amanda saw that her husband sat in the prow biting his lip, while Captain Janders sat in the stem, riveted in hatred. Even the sailors, New England men all, were harshly silent, their mouths pursed into tight lines. Only Captain Janders spoke. “By God!” he cried. “At such moments I wish we were armed. I wish to Almighty God we had sent that damned foul thing to the bottom.” In fury he threw a handful of letters at the missionaries’ feet. “I would not entrust your letters to such a ship. A slaver.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, John Whipple reported to the missionaries: “It was horrible. They had not secured the chains below, and you could hear them swinging in the swell. It was a dark ship. Abner, would you pray?” And in the hot cabin, on their first night across the equator, the missionaries prayed and Abner said simply, “Where there is darkness, Lord, allow the light to shine. Where there is evil, substitute goodness. But let us not concern ourselves only with distant evil. Remind us always that our first responsibility is the evil that occurs within our immediate environs. Lord, help us not to be hypocrites. Help us to do Thy work day by day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He was so moved by this chance brush with the slaver that he could not sleep and spent the night on deck, peering off into the direction of Africa, hoping that God would vouschafe him a flash of light indicating that the blackbirder had exploded. Toward morning he was visited by Keoki Kanakoa, who said, “Reverend Hale, you worry so much about Africa. Did you not know that there are also slaves in Hawaii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are?” Abner asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. On my father’s island there are many slaves. We call them foul corpses, and they may touch nothing that we touch. They are kapu. Not long ago they were kept for the human sacrifices.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me all about them,” the stunned young missionary said, and as Keoki explained the various rituals and kapus involving the foul corpses, Abner felt an impatient fury mounting in his throat, so that before Keoki finished he cried, “Keoki, when I get to Hawaii there will be no more slavery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will be difficult,” the giant Hawaiian warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keoki, you will eat with the foul corpses.” He told none of the other missionaries of this resolve, not even Jerusha, but as dawn came he knew in his heart that that strange tall ship, that cruel Brazilian slaver, had been sent across his path at the equator for a purpose. “There will be no more slavery in Hawaii,” he swore as the sun rose.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was on the long, dreary run to Cape Horn, more than six thousand miles in almost a straight line, that the famous “missionary’s disease” struck in earnest, so that long after seasickness was forgotten, missionary families would recall with embarrassment and discomfort the illness which really prostrated them.</p>

  <p class="normal">They called it, in a blush of euphemism, biliousness, and day after day Jerusha would inquire cautiously, “Reverend Hale, do you still suffer from biliousness?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He would reply, “Yes, my dear companion, I do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since all the other couples were conducting similar inquiries, with identical responses, the missionaries began to look with truly jaundiced eyes at their doctor, as if Brother Whipple ought by some miracle to be able to dispel the tormenting biliousness. He studied his authorities, especially the Family Medical Book, and prescribed various time-honored cures. “Two tablespoons of ipecac and rhubarb,” he advised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Whipple, I’ve been taking ipecac for weeks,” a worried missionary reported. “No good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you tried two grains of calomel, Brother Hewlett?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It helps at the moment … but .. .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then it’ll have to be castor oil … and walking.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t take castor oil, Brother Whipple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then walk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So the dreadfully constipated missionaries took ipecac and rhubarb and calomel and castor oil. But mostly they walked. After breakfast all who were able would stride purposefully up and down, up and down the, cramped afterdeck, turning on the animal pens at one end, and the foremast at the other. Sometimes they walked for hours, trying to shame their recalcitrant intestines into action, but nothing really cured the biliousness.</p>

  <p class="normal">The after quarters contained one latrine, unbearably foul, and if each missionary occupied it for only fifteen minutes at a time, which was not excessive in their condition, five and a half hours were automatically consumed, and the day was half spent with no time allocated for emergency cases on the part of those who in extreme desperation had taken a master dose or ipecac, rhubarb, calomel and castor oil, all together.</p>

  <p class="normal">It therefore became necessary for Brother Whipple, with Captain Janders’ amused consent and with able help from Keoki Kanakoa, to rig an unclosed improvised privy aft of the stern. At stated intervals all females would go below decks, and one minister after another would test his good fortune on the open seat, his hands wrapped desperately about the timbers Keoki had hammered into place, his pallid white bottom winking at the whales.</p>

  <p class="normal">Day after day they walked. The boisterous sailors, whose bodies were kept functioning by the extraordinary amount of work they had to do, irreverently made bets as to which of the brothers would next try his luck on the precarious perch, and they referred to the constant walking as “the missionary waltz.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One day, in despair, poor, tied-up Abner demanded of Brother Whipple, “Why is it that God afflicts us so and does nothing to those impious sailors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s simple, Brother Hale,” the doctor laughed. “We all got seasick and cleaned our lower quarters completely. Then we ate little and allowed it to compact itself. Lacking fruit and vegetables the compacting became harder. But most of all, we did no work. Sailors work, so God looks after their bellies.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner wasn’t sure but what Brother Whipple had indulged in blasphemy, but he was too uncomfortable to argue, so he merely said, “I feel dreadful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let me see your eyes,” Whipple ordered, and when he saw tie bleary yellow stains he said, “You are dreadful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can I do?” Abner pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Walk,” Whipple commanded, and the missionary waltz resumed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Brother Whipple took most of his walks at night, when the stars were out and when his interest in science could be freely indulged. His long discussions with the mates over astronomy came so to occupy his mind that he frequently absented himself from evening prayers, a dereliction which caused Abner to detail two brothers to investigate.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are a family, as you know, Brother Whipple,” they said. “Our prayers are family prayers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sorry I was forgetful,” Whipple apologized. “I’ll attend prayers.” But as soon as the first worshiper cried, “Amen!” the young doctor was up the hatch and talking astronomy.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How does a mariner feel when he crosses the line and sees that the North Star has vanished?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” Mister Collins reflected, “no matter how well you know the southern stars, it’s a wrench to see old reliable go down over the horizon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From his work with the mates, Whipple learned to work Bowditch for both latitude and longitude, and occasionally his calculations coincided with those of Captain Janders, which led the latter to predict, “You’d make a better navigator than you ever will a missionary.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll trap your soul yet,” Whipple retorted. “If I could get Brother Hale up here . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Leave him where he is!” Janders urged.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, Captain Janders had to admit surprise at the success Abner was enjoying in converting the crew. He had five Bibles out and two more pending. Six men had been cajoled into signing temperance pledges, at which Janders growled, “Easiest thing in the world is to get sailors on board to become temperance. Trick is to do it in port.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The sailors appreciated Abner’s curious gift of raising exactly those questions they had often pondered, so that even men who were not religious would stand about as he argued: “Suppose this voyage occupies four years. On the first week you are away, your mother dies. You don’t hear about it. Now what is your relation to your mother during the next two hundred weeks? She is dead, yet you think of her as living. She is dead, yet she has the capacity to help you. Is it not possible that she is indeed living? In Jesus Christ?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t think about it that way, Reverend,” an unbeliever said. “But in another way I did. Suppose I’m married, and when I leave Boston my wife is … well … if you’ll excuse me . . . expecting. Now I never see that baby for four years, but when I come home he looks like me, has my habits, and in some unknown way has come to love me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only sometimes he don’t look like you,” the old whaler observed from his own experience. “What then?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you converted Captain Janders?” Cridland asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner replied sorrowfully. ” ‘The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait a minute, Reverend!” an old hand corrected. “Cap’n believes. When you ain’t aboard he conducts services.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“True believing requires that you submit your will entirely to God’s,” Abner explained. “Captain Janders will not confess that he lives in a state of abject sin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t classify him as no sinner,” the old whaler reflected. “Not a proper, hard-working sinner, that is. Now you take a man like Cap’n Hoxworth of the whaler Carthaginian … I seen Cap’n Hoxworth get four naked Honolulu girls into his cabin at one time . . . Well, as a sinner, our cap’n just don’t compare.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, Abner waged relentless campaigns against Captain Janders, particularly in the matter of novels, which the captain read ostentatiously immediately after each Sabbath sermon. “You will learn to call such books aborninations,” Abner mournfully predicted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders fought back with irony: “You converting any more old whalers, Brother Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The question infuriated Abner, symbolizing as it did the world’s pernicious habit of rejoicing over the downfall of sanctimonious men. Actually, he could have turned the tables on the captain, so far as the old whaler was concerned, for the man was agonizingly eager to win back his Bible before reaching Cape Horn. “Many’s a sailor’s been lost at the Horn, Reverend,” he constantly pleaded. “Don’t make me round the Horn without a Bible!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Abner had absorbed one fundamental lesson on this trip: the established church must not be maneuvered into a position of danger by the backsliding of fools who were never truly saved in the first place. It is such who have the greatest power to damage the church and they must be denied the opportunity of doing so. Frequently, on the long leg south Abner would sit on a trunk in his stateroom and analyze this case with his seven companions: “I was too prompt to accept this man . . . too eager for merely another number rather than for a secured soul. We must never repeat this foolish mistake in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, on the evening of November 24, just as Keoki placed on the half-moon table the Saturday night suet pudding, an unexpected gale from the southwest struck the Thetis port-side and threw her well onto her beam ends. Since the storm had come without warning, the after hatch had not been closed and torrents of cold gray water cascaded into the cabin. The lamp swung parallel to the decking. Food and chairs and missionaries were swept into a jumble and buried in new floods ripping down the hatchway. There were screams, and from the stateroom where Jerusha lay ghastly ill, Abner heard a plaintive cry, “Are we sinking?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stumbled to her and found her berth drenched with water, and everything in confusion. “We shall be safe,” he said firmly. “God is with this ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They heard the hatchway being hammered into place and smelled the loss of air. Then the cook shouted, “Cape Horn is rushing out to meet us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will the storm last long?” Brother Whipple inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe four weeks,” the cook replied, picking up the debris of his meal.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Sunday, November 25, Abner ventured on deck to survey the damage, and reported breathlessly, “All the livestock was swept away. That first big wave almost capsized us.” One by one the missionaries, those who were not confined to their bunks, viewed the storm and discovered what the cook meant when he said that Cape Horn had come to meet them. A cold, dismal fog enveloped the ship where the warm waters of the Atlantic met the icy wastes of the Antarctic, and the waves rose high in the gloom, falling away into icy depths.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m fearfully cold,” Jerusha told her husband, but there was nothing he could do. The little Thetis kept probing southward toward the Cape itself, and each day took her into colder waters. The thermometer stood at thirty-nine degrees, with no fires allowed on board. Bedding was wet from the dousing and all gear was molding in unaired boxes. Most of the time the hatchway was covered, so that no air swept into the dank confined cabin, and with no freedom for walking, griping biliousness overtook the missionaries.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Tuesday, November 27, John Whipple hurried below with heartening news. “We can see Staten Island to port, so we must be approaching the Cape. The waves aren’t as big as we feared.” He led his companions aloft to view one of the bleakest, loneliest lands on earth, lying off the tip of the continent. Through partial mist its low treeless hills were visible, and Whipple said, “We are seeing it in summer. Imagine what it must be like in winter.” But the missionaries were looking not at Staten Island, but rather at the terrifying waters that lay ahead.</p>

  <p class="normal">There, at the southern tip of the habitable world, in a latitude of fifty-five degrees, the earth-girdling southern currents that thundered in from the lower Pacific crashed into the turbulent swells of the Atlantic, and the missionaries could see that the resulting waves were mountain-high and clothed with fog and fear. If a sailor were lucky enough to hit Staten Island with an easterly at his back, he could penetrate those monstrous waves with some hope of success, but when, as in late November of 1821, both the set of the Pacific and the bearing of its winds were from the west, there was slight chance of doubling the Cape.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Captain Janders, face grim within the rim of sandy whiskers, was stubbornly determined to prosecute every chance. “I’ll not be the captain who has to write in his log, ‘Today abandoned hope of doubling Cape Horn and turned back across the Atlantic to try Cape Good Hope. If you write that in your log, they never let you forget it. You’re the Yankee who couldn’t double the Cape.” So he gambled that either the wind would veer to the east and blow him through, or that the Pacific swell would somehow abate and allow him to beat into the wind, no matter where it stood.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am convinced that one or the other will happen,” Janders repeated doggedly. But on the evening of Thanksgiving Day he stumbled down into the cabin and said dourly, “If any of you missionaries have personal knowledge of God, I would appreciate your prayers now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do the winds continue against us?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never seen ‘em so bad,” Janders growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will we have to turn back?” one of the wives inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, ma’am, we won’t!” Janders said firmly. “There’ll be no man say I tried the Cape and failed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was gone back to the deck John Whipple said, “I see no fault in supporting him with our prayers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nor do I, Brother Whipple,” Jerusha said, and Dr. Whipple prayed: “Let us recall the reassuring words of Proverbs: ‘I neither teamed wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. Who “hath ascended up into the heavens, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name?’ Brethren, we who stand at the ends of the earth, where the winds are gathered in God’s fist against us, let us not forget that it is the just man whom God tries. The evil man passes and repasses this Cape with no concern, for he has already been tested. It is you and I who have not been tested. Let us pray that these winds abate in our favor, but if they do not, let us doubly rely upon the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">By Saturday, December 1, the Thetis had spent seven full days negotiating a distance of one hundred and ten miles. During breaks in the storm, the forlorn missionaries had seen blunt and brutal Tierra del Fuego to the north and had retired to freezing berths, huddling together in fear and seasickness. The tempest from the west did not abate.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Sunday, December 2, the Thetis turned due west to find a channel which would carry them north of Cape Horn itself, perched on an insignificant island to the south, but this day the waves from the Pacific were terrifying even to Captain Janders. Once, when the Thetis heeled far over onto her beam ends, he looked in dismay at Mister Collins, who was brave enough to say, “I’ve never sailed in a worse sea, Captain. We’d better run for it.” In an instant Captain Janders swung his tiny brig about and sent her running before the violent storm, eastward past dangerous rocks, and within three hours, at the amazing speed of nearly thirty knots, the little Thetis lost al the westward progress she had acquired in eight days.</p>

  <p class="normal">On December 3 Mister Collins asked the fatal question: “Shall we run across the Atlantic, sir, to Cape Good Hope?” and Captain Janders replied, “We shall not!” and he trimmed his sails once more for the westerlies that roared in upon the great Pacific swells. At noon of that day John Whipple reported startling news to the frightened and freezing missionaries: “I think we’re right where we were eight days agol I’m sure that’s Staten Island to the south and the point of Tierra del Fuego to the north.” His wife asked weakly, “You mean to say that we’re being driven backward?” When her husband nodded, she said softly, “John, I have to fight so hard to stay in my berth that my elbows are bleeding. Do see how poor Sister Hale is.” And when John looked, he saw that her elbows and knees were bleeding, too. But there was nothing anyone could do but lie in his cold, wet berth and fight the frantic rolling of the ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">On December 4 the Thetis reached far to the south, so that the sun barely set at all, and night consisted only of a mysterious ashen haze, holding low upon the tuibulent sea. And when it looked as if there might be better wind toward the Antarctic, Captain Janders tried his next trick. Running boldly on a tack that carried him away from the protecting island behind which mariners customarily doubled the Cape, he led his tiny brig into the waters of the Drake Passage, roughest in the world. It was a gallant move, but toward morning a vast Pacific accumulation swirling with sleet and snow swept down on the Thetis, lifted her high, and threw her sideways, so that water rushed into the terror-stricken cabin and filled the lower berths. “Abnerl Abner!” bruised Jerusha screamed from the floor, forgetting his proper title. “We’re drowning.” He replied calmly, picking her up gently and moving her into John Whipple’s upper bunk, “No, my beloved companion, God is with this ship. He will not abandon us.” The terrifying shaking continued, accompanied by fresh torrents of water slopping aft from some ruptured forward area. “We cannot stand this!” a hysterical wife screamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God is with this ship,” Abner quieted her, and in the weird darkness, with water about his ankles and the sobbing of those who thought they would soon be dead, he prayed in a strong voice and reminded the missionaries that they had come on this voyage to do God’s work and it was notorious that God tested His chosen and that their way was never quick or easy. “We shall ride through this storm and see the pleasant valleys of Hawaii,” he affirmed. Then he went to each freezing stateroom and helped lift luggage out of berths into which it had been swept. No attempt was made to serve meals, but when Captain Janders looked below and saw the work Abner was doing, he shouted to the cook, “Bring some cheese aft to these poor people.” Abner asked, “Are we rounding the Cape?” and Janders replied, “Not yet, but we will be.” However, toward six in the evening it became apparent that the night’s waves were to be even more tumultuous, so he said at last to Mister Collins, “We’ll run for it,” and once more within less than an hour they lost all they had gained in two days.</p>

  <p class="normal">On December 5 the wounded brig Thetis, coated with ice, was back at the Atlantic entrance to the waters that guarded the Cape, and there was no sign of either an easterly wind or an abated swell, so Captain Janders kept his ship tacking idly back and forth, waiting, and about ten o’clock at night it looked as if the big chance had come, for the wind seemed to veer. Crowding sail, the captain lashed his ship into the swells and for the remaining two hours of that gray day the Thetis chewed awkwardly into the heavy seas and apparently made some progress.</p>

  <p class="normal">On December 6 the brig actually accomplished forty-eight miles into a snowstorm, bucking a sea as choppy and as sickening as any the missionaries had so far experienced. There was not the abstract terror of the ship on beam ends, but there was the constant rise and fall, wallow and recovery that made even inanimate objects like trunks and boxes creak in misery. The cold, intensified by the sleet and snow, grew worse, and wives huddled beneath wet blankets, shivering and convinced that death would be preferable to two more weeks of Cape Horn. But Brother Whipple reported heartily to all that at last the brig was making headway.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Friday, December 7, the wind perversely returned to its former heading; the seas became more confused; and once again the Thetis stood on her beam ends. This time she came perilously close to foundering. Heavy trunks that had been cleated down tore loose and piled brutally into berths. Timbers creaked ominously as if they could bear no more, and the little brig fell sickeningly into a trough out of which it seemed it might not recover. “Oh, God! Let me die!” Jerusha prayed, for a trunk had her pinned against the bulkhead. Other women were crying, “Brother Hale! Can you move this box?” for they knew that he was the only missionary then- capable of constructive work.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was some minutes therefore before he got to Jerusha, and he found her wandering in speech. “Let me die, God. It wasn’t Abner’s fault. He was good to me, but let me die!” she whimpered. He pulled the trunk away and felt her limbs to see if they were broken, but as he did so, he heard her prayer for death. “What did you say?” he asked, appalled. “God, let me die!” she prayed blindly. With a violent slap he thrashed her on the cheeks and cried, “Mrs. Hale! You may not blaspheme!” He continued slapping her until she recovered her wits, and then he sat beside her and said, “I am afraid too, my beloved companion. I am afraid we are going to drown. Oh!” And he braced himself for a wild ride down the hollow of a wave, and the shattering pause, and the groaning climb. “Do even you think we are lost?” Jerusha asked softly. “I am afraid,” he said humbly, “but we must not blaspheme, even if we are deserted.” She asked, “What did I say, dear husband?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He replied, “It’s best forgotten. Mrs. Hale, will you pray?” And in the cold, dark ‘tween-decks he coached her in what he thought would be their last prayer.</p>

  <p class="normal">At that moment above decks, Captain Janders was shouting in fury, “Goddamnit, Mister Collins, we can’t make it!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we run for Good Hope, sir?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We shall not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll founder, sir,” Collins warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Turn around, and we’ll lick our wounds in the Falklands,” Janders replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And then?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll go through the Strait of Magellan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So <span>THE HAMFERDITE BRIG</span> Thetis, seventy-nine feet long, two hundred and thirty tons out of Boston, was finally turned away from Cape Horn, and on a northeast heading, which took advantage of the strong winds, it shot up to the Falkland Islands, which hung in the South Atlantic off the coast of Patagonia.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Falklands were a group of rocky, wind-swept, treeless islands used by whalers—and those who could not double the Cape—for recuperation, and when the forbidding group hove into view on December 10 they seemed to the bruised missionaries like fragments of Beulah Land, and as soon as the Thetis had anchored in a rocky cove, all hastened to be among the first ashore. All through the brief, gray starless night John Whipple inspected the cold ground, and at dawn he hailed the brig with good news: “There are geese and ducks here and some small cormorants. Bring all the guns!” He organized a hunting party that was to provide the Thetis with fresh food for many weeks. Mister Collins led another group that found sweet water to replenish the barrels and stacks of driftwood that had reached the islands from the coast of Argentina.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll keep fires going for ten days,” he promised the missionaries. “We’ll dry you out proper.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wives decked the Thetis with laundry, since none had been done for more than a hundred days, but it was energetic Abner Hale, tramping to the highest spot of the island, who made the big discovery. There was another ship hugging one of the northern harbors, and he and two sailors ran down to it. It was a whaler just in from the Pacific, and before long its skipper and Captain Janders were comparing all the charts thev had on the Magellan passage.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s a horrible passage,” the whaler said, and he showed Captain Janders and Abner how the island of Tierra del Fuego, which they had tried to pass by the southern route, stood a narrow distance off the mainland of South America, so that the Strait of Magellan was actually the northern alternate route around Tierra del Fuego.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nobody aboard either ship had ever penetrated the strait, but many recollected stories. “In 1578 Francis Drake made the passage in seventeen easy days,” a historical expert recalled. “But in 1764 it took the Frenchman Bougainville fifty-two days. Record is two Spaniards who fought Magellan’s route for a hundred and fifty days. But they finally made it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why is it so difficult?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It isn’t,” the whaler explained. “Not until you reach the other end.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then what happens?” Abner pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“See these rocks? The Four Evangelists? That’s where ships perish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why? Fog?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. Westerlies from the Pacific pile up tremendous waves all along your exit from the passage. In trying to break out, you run upon the Evangels.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean it’s worse than where we just were?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The difference is this,” the whaler explained. “If you try to double Cape Horn in adverse conditions, you might have fifty days of mountainous seas. It just can’t be done. At the Four Evangelists the waves are worse than anything you’ve seen so far, but you can breast them in an afternoon … if you’re lucky.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is it precisely that so many ships go on the rocks?” Janders reviewed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Here on Desolation Island. It’s not bad of itself, but when a ship thinks it’s breasted the Evangelists, it often finds it can’t maintain position. In panic it turns and runs, and Desolation grabs it. Fifty . . . hundred ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any survivors?” Mister Collins asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“On Desolation rocks?” the whaler countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is the trick?” Mister Collins pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Find yourself a good harbor toward the western end of Desolation. Go out every day for a month if necessary and try to breast the Evangelists. But always keep yourself in position so that when you see you’ve got to run back to harbor for the night, you’ll be in command and not the waves.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s exactly as I understand it,” Captain Janders agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is this an easterly coming up?” Mister Collins asked hopefully. “Seems to me if we caught a reliable easterly we’d be in luck. It would push us right through the strait.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s an error!” the whaler snorted. “Because while it’s true that an easterly will help you a little in the first part of the transit, by the time the wind has built up a sea at the western exit, it simply creates added confusion around the Four Evangelists. Then you really have hell.”&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“But even so, the waves can be penetrated?” Janders inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Dutchmen did it. So did die Spaniards. But remember, go out every day from Desolation and come back every night till you find the right sea. And you do the steering. Not the storm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The whaler, sensing that Abner might be a minister, asked him if he would consent to conduct divine services as a guest, and this pleased the missionary very much, for he looked at Captain Janders as if to say, “Here’s one sea captain who acknowledges God,” but Janders could never willingly permit Abner complete triumph, so in snakelike tones he destroyed Hale’s paradise by commenting, when the whaler went below to rouse the men, “He’s probably run the vilest ship on the seas. Probably has crimes on his head no man could measure. Ask him what he did in Honolulu? Once these whalers get back around the Cape and near Boston, they all beg for one good prayer to wash away their accumulation of evil.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, a surly, husky lot of men and officers assembled for worship, and Abner flayed whatever crimes they had committed, with this text: “Leviticus 25, verse 41: ‘And shall return unto his own family.’ And upon returning, will his conscience return with him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In impassioned words, heightened by Captain Janders’ goading, he analyzed the condition of a man who had been away from both the home of the Lord and the home of his family for four years, the changes which had occurred both in him and in his home of which he could not be aware and the steps which must be taken to remedy those changes, if ill, and to capitalize upon them, if favorable. The whalers listened with astonishment as he laid bare their half-expressed thoughts, and at the end of the service three men asked if he would pray with them, and when the prayers were over, the captain said, “That was a powerful sermon, young man. I should like to give you a token of our ship’s appreciation.” And he surprised Abner by delivering to the Thetis’ longboat a stalk of handsome green bananas.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’ll ripen and be good for many days,” he said, “and the sickly ones will enjoy them.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are they?” Abner asked.&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bananas, son. Good for constipation. Better get to like them because they’re the principal food in Hawaii.” The whaler showed Abner how to peel one, took a big bite, and gave the stub to Abner.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Once you become familiar with&#160; ‘em, they’re real good.” But Abner found the penetrating smell of the skin offensive, whereupon the whaler bellowed, “You damn well better get to like ‘em, son because that’s what you’ll be eatin’ from now on.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were you in Hawaii?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was I in Honolulu?” the whaler shouted. Then, recalling the sermon just concluded, he finished lamely, “We took a dozen whales south of there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On Tuesday, December 18, after Captain Janders had copied all the charts that his fellow skipper could provide of the Magellan passage, and had compared them with his own, finding that no two placed any single island in the passage even close to where the others did, the Thetis weighed anchor and headed back for Tierra del Fuego, but this time to the northern end of the island, where it abutted onto South America, and where the forbidding passage discovered by Magellan waited sullenly. As its bleak headlands came into view on the morning of December 21, Captain Janders said to Mlister Collins, “Take a good look at ‘em. We’re not comin’ back this way.” And with stubborn determination he plunged into the narrow strait which had defeated many vessels.</p>

  <p class="normal">The missionaries were fascinated by the first days of the passage and they lined the rails staring first at South America and then at Tierra del Fuego. These were the first days of summer, and once a band of natives clad only in skins were spotted. At night Abner saw the fires that had given the large island its name when Magellan first coasted, for in spite of the fact that all was bleak, it was also interesting.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Thetis, aided by the easterly wind, sometimes made as much as thirty miles in a day, but more often about twenty were covered in slow and patient probing. After the first westward thrust was completed, the brig turned south, following the shoreline of Tierra del Fuego, and the days became somnolent, and there was scarcely any night at all. The missionaries sometimes slept on deck, wakening to enjoy any phenomenon that the night produced. When winds were adverse, as they often were, the Thetis would tie up and hunting parties would go ashore, so that for Christmas all hands had duck and thought how strange it was to be in these gray latitudes instead of in white New England. There was no seasickness now, but one passenger was growing to hate the Strait of Magellan as she had never hated any other water.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was Jerusha Hale, for although her two major sicknesses had departed, another had taken their place, and it consisted of a violent desire to vomit each time her husband made her eat a banana. “I don’t like the smell of the oil,” she protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t like it either, my dear,” he explained patiently, “but if this is the food of the islands . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s wait till we get to the islands,” she begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, if the Lord providentially sent us these bananas in the manner he did . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The other women don’t have to eat them,” she pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The other women were not sent them by the direct will of God,” he reasoned.</p>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend Hale,” she argued slowly, “I’m sure that when I get off this ship, where I’ve been sick so much, I’ll be able to eat bananas. But here the oil in the skin reminds me . . . Husband, I’m going to be sick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Mrs. Hale!” he commanded. And twice a day he carefuly peeled a banana, stuck half in his mouth, and said, against his own better judgment, “It’s delicious.” The other half he forcefully pushed into Jerusha’s, watching her intently until she had swallowed it. The procedure was so obviously painful to the sickly girl that Amanda Whipple could not remain in her berth while it was being carried out, but what made it doubly nauseous was that Abner had strung the ripening bananas from the roof of their stateroom, and there they swung, back and forth, through every hour of the passage, and as they ripened they smelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Jerusha thought: “I’ll watch the bunch grow smaller,” but it showed no effect of her efforts to diminish it. Instead it grew larger, more aromatic, and swung closer to her face at night. “My dear husband,” she pleaded, “indeed I shall be sick!” But he would place his hand firmly over her abdomen until the day’s ration was swal-lowed, and he refused to allow her to be sick, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p class="normal">After one such performance John Whipple asked, “Why do you like bananas so much, Brother Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t,” Abner said. “They make me sick, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why do you eat them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because obviously the Lord intended me to eat them. How did I get them? As a result of having preached a sermon. I would be an ingrate if I did not eat them!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you believe in omens?” the young scientist asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Abner inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Superstitions? Omens?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why do you ask that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was thinking. Keoki Kanakoa has been telling me about all the omens under which he used to live. When one of their canoes went out to sea, they had an old woman who did nothing but study omens. And if an albatross came, or a shark, that meant something . . . god had sent them . . . you could learn what the god intended . . . if you could read the omen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What has that to do with me?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It seems to me, Brother Hale, that you’re that way with the bananas. They were given to you, so they must have been sent by God. So if they were sent by God, they must be eaten.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“John, you’re blaspheming!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Blaspheming or not, I’d throw those bananas overboard. They’re making everybody sick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Overboard!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Reverend Hale,” Jerusha interrupted. “Throw them overboard.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is intolerable!” Abner cried, storming onto the deck, from which he speedily returned to the stateroom. “If anyone touches those bananasl They were sent by God to instruct us in our new life. You and I, Mrs. Hale, are going to eat every one of those bananas. It is God’s will.” So as the Thetis crept agonizingly ahead, the bananas danced malodorously in the stateroom.</p>

  <p class="normal">The brig had now left Tierra del Fuego and was amidst the hundreds of nameless islands that comprised the western half of the passage. The winds veered and the dreary days ran into dreary weeks and Captain Janders wrote repeatedly in his log: “Tuesday, January 15. Twenty-sixth day in the passage. Land close on both hands. Beat all day into adverse wind. Made 4 miles but toward sunset lost on every tack. Could find no hold for anchor on sloping shores. Ran back and moored where we anchored last night. But hope this westerly gale continues, for it will smooth out waters at 4 Evangels. Shore party shot fine geese and caught 2 pailsfl. sweet mussels.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Day followed day, yielding a progress of four miles or six or none. Men would tow the Thetis from anchorage out into the wind and gamble that they would sleep in the same spot that night. Two facts preyed increasingly on their minds. The land about them was so bleak that it could not possibly support life for long, especially if summer left, and it was leaving. And all thought: “If it is so difficult here, what will it be when we reach Desolation Island? And when we have reached there, what must the Four Evangelists be like?” It seemed that inch by painful inch they were approaching a great climax, and this was true.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the thirty-second day of this desokte passage an easterly wind sprang up and whisked the little brig along the north shore of Desolation Island, a location made more terrible by the fact that sailors spotted the stern boards of some ship that had foundered on the rocks. The sea grew rougher, and eighteen of the missionaries found it advisable to stay below, where the smell of bananas added to their qualms. That night Jerusha declared that she could not, on pain of death, eat another banana, but Abner, having heard such protests before, gallantly ate his half, then forced the remainder into Jerusha’s mouth. “You may not get sick,” he commanded, holding her stomach in his control. But the ship lurched as the first fingers of the Pacific swell probed into the passage, and neither Jerusha nor Abner could dominate her retching, and she began to vomit.&#160; “Mrs. Hale!” he shouted, clapping his other hand over her mouth, but the sickness continued until the berth was fouled. “You did that on purpose!” he muttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Husband, I am so sick,” she whimpered. The tone of her words impressed him, and tenderly he cleaned away the mess, making her as comfortable as possible.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not doing this to torment you, my dear companion,” he argued. “God sent us these bananas. Look!” And he took down one of the yellow fruits, which he had grown to detest, and ate the entire thing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to be sick again!” she cried, and again he washed away the filth.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">The next morning showed that the Thetis had run to the end of Desolation Island and had completed more than ninety-nine hundredths of the Magellan passage. All that remained was to effect the short dash past the Four Evangelists, four cruel and unpopulated rocks that guarded the western entrance to the strait. So at dawn on Tuesday, January 22, 1822, the little brig left the protection of Desolation Island to test the meeting ground of storms, the wave-racked confluence of the easterly moving Pacific and the westerly moving Atlantic, and as the whaling captain had predicted, the good winds that had accompanied the Thetis on her last days now ac-counted for a turbulence that no man aboard the ship had hitherto experienced.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Gigantic waves from the Pacific lashed in with terrifying force, apparently able to sweep all before them, but the choppier seas from the Atlantic rushed like a terrier into the thundering surf and tore it into a thousand separate oceans, each with its own current and direction. As his small craft approached this multiple maelstrom Captain Janders ordered, “All hands on deck lash yourselves to the ship,” and lines were secured about waists and chests, and hand holds were quickly improvised, and the Thetis, all openings closed, plunged into the tremendous confusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first fifteen minutes the tiny brig was thrashed about as if the terriers of the sea had left off tormenting each other and had turned on her. She was lifted up and thrown down, ripped along on her port beams, then wallowed over and thrown backwards. She slipped and slid, and no man not tied to her decks could have survived aloft.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you keep your eye upon the Evangelists, Mister Collins?” Captain Janders shouted above the fury.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we take more seas, Mister Collins?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We cannot, sir.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll turn and run.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mind the rocks, sir.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">And the Thetis, whipping around, slashed into the violent seas coming from the Atlantic, and sped like a wounded sea animal back to Desolation Island. Below, the missionaries prayed. Not even the sick were able to remain in their berths, so violent the shaking and pitching had been.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly it was calm, and Captain Janders hid his little craft in a snug harbor whose shoreline was shaped like a fishhook. And each morning for the next week, Abner Hale, John Whipple, two other missionaries and four stout sailors rowed ashore with long rope attached to the prow of the Thetis. Running around to the tip of the fishhook, they would strain and dig into the sand, pulling until the brig began to move. Slowly, slowly, they would tow it out to the entrance of the main passage, and then run back to the rowboat and overtake it.</p>

  <p class="normal">And each day for a week the Thetis nosed its way carefully into the meeting ground of the oceans, tested them, tried, valiantly probed, and courted destruction. The turbulence was so majestic that there seemed no possibility of subduing it, and the sailors lashed to the masts wondered if the captain would turn and head back through the strait for Good Hope. But each evening Captain Janders swore, “Tomorrow we’ll break the spell. Tomorrow we’ll be free.” In his log he wrote: “Tuesday, January 29. Tried again. Gigantic swells from Pacific clashing with choppy sea from Atlantic caused scenes of most frightful violence. Surges so high no ship could master them. Ran for same harbor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the thirtieth day of January the winds veered to the west, which in the long run was a good thing in that they would now stop supporting the Atlantic choppiness and turn to stabilizing the unhampered Pacific; but their immediate effect was to prohibit any further assault on the exit. Therefore, the Thetis remained tied to shore in her snug fishhook harbor while Captain Janders, Mister Collins, Abner and John Whipple climbed a small hill to survey the wild confluence of the oceans. They could not see the Four Evangelists, but they knew where they were, and as they studied the pattern of the giant waves, Abner said, “Have you thought, sir, that perhaps you are being held back by God’s will?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders did not growl at the young man. “I am willing to consider anything, if only we can breast that damned mile of ocean.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It occurred to me last night,” Abner said, “that your insane refusal to dispose of your worldly novels has cursed this ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mister Collins looked at the young minister with blank astonishment and was about to make an obscene expostulation when Janders silenced him. “What did you have in mind, Reverend Hale?”&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “If we missionaries can pray, and if we can get this ship through the barrier, will you then dispose of your worldly literature, and as the captain of a ship that needs God, accept books from me?”&#160;&#160;&#160; “I will,” Janders said solemnly. And the four men, standing on a hill at the end of the world, entered into a compact, and when the missionaries were gone, Janders justified himself to his first mate: “I am determined to pass this point. I’ve never seen such seas as we encountered at Cape Horn. Now this. Call me superstitious if you will, but it’s bad luck for a ship to carry a minister. We’ve got eleven of&#160; ‘em. If they’re the cause of the bad luck, maybe they can also be the cause of good luck. I’ll try anything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Abner assembled the missionaries and told them of the compact. “God has been holding this ship back to teach us a lesson,” he assured them, “but our prayers will lift the curse.” To John Whipple and others, this seemed like medievalism, and they would not pray, but the majority did, and at the end of the prayer Whipple asked if he might pray, too, and Abner assented “Lord, strengthen the hands and the eyes of our mariners,” Whipple prayed. “Abate the wind, lower the waves and let us pass.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Amen,” Captain Janders said.</p>

  <p class="normal">After prayers, Abner visited Jerusha, still bedridden, and shared a banana with her. When she protested that it was this which was keeping her abed, he pleaded: “We are placing our destiny in the hands of God tonight. Please bear with me, beloved companion, and if we pass the barrier tomorrow, you will not have to eat any more bananas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that a sacred promise?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is,” he assured her. So she mastered her gorge, felt her husband’s firm hand on her stomach, and ate.</p>

  <p class="normal">At four o’clock in the morning the entire ship met for prayers, and after the missionaries had spoken long, Captain Janders prayed, “Lord, get us through.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not yet five when Abner and John rowed ashore with their six regular towing companions, and the small craft edged its way into the main channel, but when the rope men were hauled back on-board, Abner announced: “This day I want to pray on deck.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Lash yourself to the mast,” Janders grunted. To Collins he said, “The waves are as big as ever, but the sea is steadier and we have a wind we can cut into.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“As good a day as we’ll get,” the mate calculated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’re away!” Janders cried, and the Thetis probed far out to sea, well south of the Four Evangelists and into the wildest part of the ocean.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were the hours of decision. Two days ago the problem had been&#160; to&#160; ride&#160; with&#160; the&#160; helpful&#160; wind&#160;&#160; from&#160;&#160; the&#160; stern,&#160; trying to accumulate sufficient speed to penetrate the massive waves. Now the wind was full in the face, and the Thetis had to tack first north, then south, then north, trying always to gain a few hundred yards of purchase in the sea, so that on one great burst to the north the tiny brig would at last clear the Evangelists. The grave danger involved was that on the vital run to the north, the Thetis would not hold its advantage, but would be swept sideways by the waves, and onto the rocks, crashing in final and hopeless destruction.</p>

  <p class="normal">The hours of early morning passed, and the Thetis made one fruitless tack after another. Often on her beam ends, she fought vainly for leverage against the sea, but Abner could feel her slipping away, back toward Desolation Island, away from the line of safety that would permit a long tack past the Four Evangelists.</p>

  <p class="normal">The hours of midday came and went, and the little brig fought on. Now she gained a mile and entered a more turbulent part of the ocean, where the full and mighty Pacific lashed out at her, and the timbers creaked and the masts swayed and Abner watched the whiskered face of Captain Janders, peering ahead, calculating the wind.</p>

  <p class="normal">At three in the afternoon the pounding became almost unbearable on deck, and all not lashed down would have been washed away by the gigantic seas, so that Abner prayed, “Dear God, care for those below. Let the air they breathe be sweet.” And he could smell the foul air of the staterooms and pitied the missionaries.</p>

  <p class="normal">At four o’clock, but with no fear of encroaching dusk, for the summer sun would not set till nearly ten, the position of the Thetis was perilous. For Captain Janders was required either to stand farther out to sea and thus surrender all hope of running safely back to Desolation Island, or to abandon this day’s attempt. He was loath to do the latter, because he had got closer to position than ever before, so for some minutes in the height of the gale he pondered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s only half a mile more of turbulence,” he shouted to Mister Collins.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hardly that, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you keep your eye on the Evangelists?” Janders cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many points more to windward must we head to pass the rocks, Mister Collins?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we hold such a course?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The question was an unfair one, and both Janders and Collins knew it, for the captain was trying to tempt his mate into making the ultimate life-or-death decision. Mister Collins looked doggedly ahead and said nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can you ease her three points into the wind, Mister Collins?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That I can, sir!” And the creaking Thetis bit more directly into the storm.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If we hold this tack, will we clear the rocks, Mister Collins?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir. If we hold this tack.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men stood tensely, trying to detect any notice of the brig’s slipping in the great troughs, but she held firm. A minute passed, then two, then three, and finally Captain Janders shouted to all topside, “We’ll run for the rocks. Stand ready to cut yourselves loose and tend the ropes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Rarely did a group of men sailing a ship face a more clear-cut problem. If the winds held, and the keel maintained its cut into the waves, this long tack would throw the Thetis just outside the Four Evangelists, and the penetration would have been accomplished, for on the southward tack the little ship could sail all night it necessary, until the last turbulence was cleared.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now’s the time to pray, Reverend Hale,” Janders shouted above the wind, and Abner, lashed to the mainmast at both the armpits and waist, prayed only that the present relationship of ship and ocean and wind be maintained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then came Mister Collins’ calm warning: “She’s slipping, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel her slipping, Mister Collins,” Captain Janders replied, his stem face hiding his fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we raise the topsail a little more into the wind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Raise her all the way, Mister Collins.” “She may carry away, sir, in this wind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders hesitated, studied the way in which his brig was losing purchase, and cried, “We’ve got to have that sail! If it holds, we’ll make it. If it carries away, no matter. We were lost anyway.” And he whipped around toward where his men were lashed, shouting directions that sent them hauling ropes which started the after topsail higher into the wind, where it could counteract the sideward set of the ocean. But as the men hauled, their lines caught in the top block, and the triangular topsail whipped dangerously in the wind, and the Thetis appeared doomed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You and you, clear the top block!” Janders shouted. And from the stormy deck, where they had been lashed to save themselves, Cridland and the old whaler cut themselves loose and grabbed for the ropes leading to the top of the mainmast.</p>

  <p class="normal">They climbed like monkeys, four secure hands, four certain feet clinging to the ropes as the mast whipped back and forth in the freezing storm. Higher and higher they went, as their ship drifted toward the rocks. “May God protect them,” Abner prayed, as they dangled far above his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Thetis now entered a segment of the sea where the waves were of special violence, for they were rebounding from the Evangelists off to starboard, and as the little brig rolled from one beam end to the other, torn this way and that, the top of the mainmast, where the two sailors worked, slashed swiftly in great arcs of more than a hundred degrees. At the extremity of each swing the tall mast whipped sharply, whistling in the wind, as if determined to dislodge the men that annoyed its ropes. On one such desperate passage Cridland lost his cap, and in grabbing for it with his right hand, he seemed, as viewed from below, to have been swept away, and Abner screamed, “God save his soul!” But it was only his hat that was gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Try the ropes again!” Captain Janders shouted. “They don’t pull clear yet,” the second mate yelled above the storm.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are we drifting toward the rocks, Mister Collins?” “We are, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we send more men aloft?” “Nothing any more can do,” Collins replied. So the two mariners stared ahead in the late afternoon storm, feeling the ship, praying. “Try the ropes again!” Janders cried, but again they failed to respond. Clasping his hands behind him, Janders took several deep breaths and said with resignation, “We’ve about eight more minutes, Mister Collins. This was a sane try.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Abner forgot the navigators near him and focused only on the two sailors, who continued to fly through great sickening arcs of heaven. Freezing rain and howling winds were upon them; the violence of the pitching ship seemed concentrated at the point where they labored; and Abner recalled the plea of the old whaler: “I would not like to round Cape Horn without a Bible.” And he began to pray for the salvation of these two brave men on whom the safety of the brig now rested. And as they flashed through the gray sky, riding high in the heart of the storm, his agonized prayers went with them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Try the ropes again!” Janders called at the expiry of two of his vital eight minutes, and this time the sailors shouted madly, and the ropes moved, and the after mainsail crept slowly up the swaying mast, and wind was mysteriously trapped in its triangular expanse, and the sliding shoreward stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel her steady on course,” Janders shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She is steady on,” Collins repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will she clear the Evangels?” Janders checked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She will clear them,” Collins replied dully, hiding the exultation his heart felt.</p>

  <p class="normal">And as the last fearful moments passed, the little brig Thetis maintained her northward tack into the storm, until at last she neared the perilous rocks, and all on deck saw that she would pass them by a margin of dreadful precision.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Lord God of Hosts is with us!” Abner shouted in unministerial joy.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Captain Janders did not hear, for he kept his eyes fixed ahead, refusing to look at the Evangelists. He was seeking the ocean area where it would be safe for him to swing the Thetis onto her new and final tack. Minutes passed, then a quarter of an hour, then a half hour, and still he kept his eyes monotonously fixed on the great, heaving ocean, until finally, in swift alteration, he heeled the brig over, and cut her back on a southward tack that would carry her through the last mountainous waves and down the final vile troughs. Then he shouted, “Bring the men down.” And Cridland and the old whaler came down from their dizzy perch and found footing on the deck. “May God be praised,” Abner mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet at this exact moment, when he was entitled to share in the ship’s jubilation, Abner was grave, as if in a trance, thinking: “Two days ago when a comforting wind was at our back, we were unable to accomplish anything. But today, with the gale right in our faces, we were able to fight it.” He studied the little brig to discover the secret whereby a New England ship could cut directly into the heart of a storm, combating the elements each inch of the way, and although he did not understand the technique Captain Janders had utilized, he understood the man, and all men, and himself. “How strange,” he reflected in the howling wind, “that when the storm is in your face, you can fight it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, when Captain Janders unleashed Abner, the mariner said, in a kind of daze, “I would not want to be the captain of whom it was said in Boston, ‘He tried to round the Horn, but ran instead for Good Hope.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one will say that of you, Captain,” Abner said proudly. The hatches were broken open and Mister Collins shouted the good news to the missionaries: “We are safe!”</p>

  <p class="normal">All below who could stand piled on deck, and in the cold wind Captain Janders said, “Reverend Hale, through God’s grace we broke through. Will you pray?” But for the only time on the voyage, Abner was numbed into silence. His eyes were filled with tears and he could think only of Cridland and the whaler, whipping through distant space, working to save the ship, and of Captain Janders fighting the storm, so John Whipple read from the sweet thundering passages in the Psalms that sailors love:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Though the water thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. . . .</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. ... “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep. “For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">It was then noticed that Captain Janders had disappeared during the reading, and he now climbed from the hatchway with an armful of books. “Yesterday I promised Reverend Hale that if his prayers could get us through this barrier, I would forsake my books for his. Richardson . . . Steme . . . Smollett. . . Walpole.” One by one he tossed them into the Pacific, already beginning to merit its name. Then he added, “From December 21 to January 31 we were forty-two days in these straits. I have never known such a passage, but we have made it safely. God be praised.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner’s triumph was tempered by defeat, for as the missionaries were watching the worldly books disappear, they were attracted by the sight of Jerusha Hale climbing on deck followed by Keoki, who lugged the remnants of the bananas. Walking unsteadily past her husband, she found the railing of the ship and threw the bananas, one by one, far out to sea. That night she told her husband, in a berth already quieter, “You bullied me, Abner . . . No, I shall use your name from now, for to me you are Abner. You bullied me through your sin of overzealousness. Never in our life again will I submit to your bullying, Abner, for I am as good a judge of God’s will as you, and God never intended a sick woman to eat so hatefully.” When Abner showed his surprise at this ultimatum she softened it by adding the truth: “While you were away talking with the men tonight, Captain Janders said that at the worst part of the passage, he felt comforted that a man of your courage was with him. What is more important, Abner, is that I am comforted that a man of your courage and piety is with me.” And she kissed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before she could kiss him again, Keoki came to the cabin, saying, “Reverend Hale, the old whaler needs you. In the fo’c’s’l.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he drunk again?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He needs you,” the Hawaiian repeated, and he led Abner to where the rugged old man lay in his filthy bunk, mumbling.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” Abner asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can I have my Bible back, now?” the whaler asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. The church gave you a Bible once, and you defiled it. You brought scorn and ridicule on us all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend Hale, you saw me in the ropes today. You know how I feared going aloft at Cape Horn . . . without a Bible, that is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, the Lord is harsh with backsliders,” Abner said sternly.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Cridland, who had shared the perils with the old man, suggested, “Reverend Hale, suppose you didn’t have to give him the Bible. Suppose I gave him mine. Would you then . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Give you another! Never! Cridland, the Lord has said, ‘The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways.’ It is these men, more than sinners, who damage the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But, Reverend Hale, in the storm it was this man who saved us all. I tried to break the sail loose, but I couldn’t. He did it all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s true, Reverend,” the old whaler confessed. “I saved the ship, and I want my Bible back.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner said. “While you were aloft, I prayed for you. And I pray for you now. If you saved this ship, we all thank you gratefully. But run the risk of having the entire ship laugh at the church again? No. That I cannot do.” And he stalked aft.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until Saturday night that Abner noticed Jerusha without her Bible. He was conducting prayers and saw that his wife was reading from Sister Whipple’s, so when they had returned to their quarters he asked quietly, “Where is your Bible, my dear wife?”</p>

  <p class="normal">She replied, “I gave it to the old whaler.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To the old … How did you hear of him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keoki came to me, weeping for the evil old man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you sided with Keoki against your own husband . . . against the church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Abner. I simply gave a brave old man a Bible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But, Mrs. Hale . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My name is Jerusha.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we discussed this in the cabin. How backsliders are the ones who do the church greatest damage.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I didn’t give my Bible to a backslider, Abner. I gave it to a man who was afraid. And if the Bible cannot dispel fear, then it is not the book we have been led to believe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the position of the mission? The foundation of our church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner,” she said persuasively, “I’m sure that this old man will backslide again, and he may do us damage. But on Thursday night, when he climbed down from that mast, he was close to God. He saved my life, and yours. And the idea of God has no meaning for me unless at such times He is willing to meet even an evil old man with love.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, the idea of God?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner, do you think that God is a man who hides up there in the clouds?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think that God hears every word you are saying, and I think He must be as perplexed as I am.” But before he could continue his charges, Jerusha, with her liquid brown curls dancing beside her ears, kissed him once more, and they fell into their narrow bunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was long after midnight when Abner Hale, troubled as never before, left his bunk and went on deck, where a few bright stars were strong enough to dominate the dim, gray Antarctic night. He was troubled, first because Jerusha had given the old man her Bible, against his orders as it were, but more because of his deep and growing appetite for his wife’s consoling body. Three times on this trip major arguments with Jerusha had ended by her laughingly drawing him into the narrow bunk, across whose opening she lowered the curtains, and each time during the next dazzling half hour he had forgot God and the problems of God. All he knew was that Jerusha Bromley Hale was more exciting than the storm, more peaceful than the ocean at rest.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was convinced that such surrender on his part must be evil. He had often listened, in the cramped stateroom, to John and Amanda Whipple whiling away the hours, and he had marked their sudden cessation of whispering, followed by strange noises and Amanda’s curious, uncontrollable cries, and he had judged that this was what the church meant when it spoke of “sanctified joy.” He had intended discussing this with Jerusha, but he had been ashamed to do so, for now and again his own great surges of “sanctified joy” had left him morally stunned. Anything so mysterious and powerful must be evil, and surely the Bible spoke frequently of women who tempted men, with disastrous results. So on the one hand, Abner’s imperfect knowledge of life inclined him to think that as a minister he would be far better off with Jerusha not so close to him. She was too intoxicating, too instinct with “sanctified joy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But as soon as he reached this confused yet understandable conclusion, he was faced with the undeniable fact, clear to even a fool, that for a minister to live without a wife was nothing but popery, and if there was one thing he wished with all his heart to avoid it was popish ways. “The great men of the Old Testament had wives,” he reasoned, “and it is not until you reach St. Paul that you get such admonitions as, ‘I say therefore to the unmarried . . . , It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.’ What does such a passage signify?” he asked himself throughout the strange half-night.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked back and forth for several hours, and the night watch joked, “He really has to do the missionary waltz!” but being of simpler minds, and particularly of minds that had long ago settled this difficult problem of man and woman—”The reason Honolulu’s the best port on earth is that in Honolulu the women climb aboard the ship already undressed and ready to work”—they would have been unable to comprehend his real perplexities.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do I love Jerusha too profoundly?” he asked the gray night. But whenever he came near concluding that he ought to love her less, he would think of her overwhelming loveliness and he would cry, “No! That is the Romish way!” and he would return to his dead center of confusion. Thus in the night hours he wrestled with his sweet, perplexing temptation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sunday rose brisk and clear, and for the first time on the voyage, the entire missionary family was able to attend topside service in the cold, bracing air which swept up from the Antarctic. Since it was to be an occasion of special celebration, the four wives in Abner’s stateroom asked their husbands to move elsewhere while they helped one another dress.</p>

  <p class="normal">For this thanksgiving day Jerusha modestly changed from the two-piece red flannel underwear she had been wearing for some weeks into a fresh set, over which she laced a stout corset held in position by a two-inch-wide busk of polished birch. Long hand-knitted black stockings were pinned to the bottom edge of the corset, and a corset cover, starched long ago in Walpole, was fitted into place, after which pantaloons, also starched, were drawn up. Thus properly founded, Jerusha now climbed into a woolen underpetticoat, a starched linen petticoat and finally a cambric petticoat, all lashed securely at the waist. A small bustle was added, over which a hooped broadcloth dress was hung, its alternate patterns of black and purple providing a properly subdued color.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next Jerusha adjusted a Paisley shawl about her shoulders, fitted a saucy poke bonnet about her pale face, slipped a knitted bag over her arm, tucked a handkerchief into one cuff of her dress, jammed her fingers first into silk mittens and then into woolen ones, and stood while Amanda Whipple held her coat for her. She was then ready for morning service, and after she had helped the other women into their coats, the four missionary wives climbed the hatchway ladder and appeared on deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now <span>CAME THE DAYS</span> of gold, the memorable days when the Thetis rolled gently in the sun, all canvas set, and dolphins chased flying fish that shone in iridescence as they leaped. The little brig was away on an unbroken leg of more than seven thousand miles from Cape Horn to Hawaii, and slowly the ugly cold of the south gave way to the increasing warmth of the north. The new stars of Tierra del Fuego began to disappear and the old familiar constellations of New England crept back into place. But most of all, the mission family became fused into a single organized and dedicated group. Some, who forgot how sick they had been and how Abner alone had kept the family functioning, protested at his assumption of leadership, and one sharp-tongued wife was heard to say, “You’d think he was the Lord’s anointed,” but her husband quieted her by remembering, “Someone had to make decisions . . . even in a family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As the equator neared, the daily lessons organized by Abner became more meaningful, and many mornings were spent, after the missionary waltz had ended, with group sessions discussing Wayland’s Moral Philosophy or Alexander’s Evidences of Christianity. Keoki Kanakoa also gave lectures on the condition of the islanders, but when he cried, “In Hawaii women are forbidden on pain of strangulation from eating bananas!” his point was somewhat dulled by Jerusha, who whispered loudly, “I count that no great privation.” But the most solemn moment in any session came when someone, usually a woman, intoned the first line of their most cherished hymn: ” ‘Blest be the tie that binds’”; for at such times the mission family was indeed bound together in a Christian brotherhood that few discover in this world.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the Pacific more placid and daily walks more congenial, seasickness vanished and constipation diminished, but a strange new illness began to take their place. At the beginning of the day women passengers would often suddenly feel an overwhelming nausea attack them, and they would have to vomit, just as if the ship were rolling in its former manner. It soon became apparent to Dr. Whipple that of the eleven wives aboard the Thetis, at least seven and possibly nine were pregnant, and he was proud when his own wife became the first to acknowledge openly that she was, as she phrased it, “expecting a small messenger from heaven.” Her handsome husband perplexed the missionaries by remarking cryptically, “It’s not surprising. I’ve known her since she was seven.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha’s pregnancy was one of the latest to be certified, but it was also the one which was most enjoyed by the mother, for she was almost unmissionary in her delight. “It is a great solace to me, Abner,” she said, “to think that I am going to become a mother in a new land. It’s beautifully symbolic … as if we were destined to accomplish great things in Hawaii.” Abner, like the other husbands, was bewildered, for like them he knew practically nothing about having babies; and then a frightening discovery was made: of the eleven women aboard the Thetis not one had ever had a child, nor had any ever attended a birth. Neither had the men, excepting Dr. Whipple, and he suddenly became a most important man, breaking out his Practical Handbook of Midwifery, which everyone studied with care; and it was then that the first substantial shadow fell across the mission family, for women began to realize that when they reached Hawaii, Dr. Whipple would be assigned to one island and they would go to another, and when their time came, the mission’s only doctor would be inaccessible, and birth would be riven under primitive conditions with only such help as a wife’s husband could muster. It was then that wives looked at their husbands with greater affection, knowing that upon these men depended the family safety; and in this way the cabin of the Thetis became a kind of obstetrical seminar, with Brother Whipple as instructor and his medical books as texts.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was early one Sunday morning that the missionaries heard the first mate cry, “Whaler to starboard!” Jerusha and Amanda, experiencing morning dizziness, did not go on deck, but the other wives did and saw looming out of the morning mists a magnificent three-masted ship, all sails set and riding the waves majestically like a queen. Smoke from the ofl pots had darkened her sails, proving her to be a whaler, and now one of her whaleboats was approaching the Thetis.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What ship are you?” Mister Collins hailed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bark Carthaginian, Captain Hoxworth, out of New Bedford. And you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brig Thetis, Captain Janders, out of Boston.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We bring you mail to carry back to Hawaii,” the whaler’s mate explained, as he climbed deftly aboard. “And we’ll take yours to New Bedford.” Then, seeing the missionaries in their tall hats, he asked, “Are these men ministers?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Missionaries, for Hawaii,” Captain Janders replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">The whaler hesitated momentarily, then nodded deferentially and asked, “Would one or two of you come aboard and conduct Sabbath services for us. We haven’t had any for months . . . really it would be years. We’ll be home soon, and we’d like to remind ourselves .. .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, recalling his good work aboard the earlier whaler at the Falklands, quickly volunteered, and so did John Whipple, but principally because he wanted to see one of New England’s great whaling ships at close hand. They were lowered into the whaleboat and started off, whereupon Abner as an afterthought shouted, “Tell our wives we’ll be back after service.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the Carthaginian the young missionaries were greeted handsomely. A tall, wiry, powerful man with a whaler’s cap far back on his head shot out a big hand and cried in a deep, commanding voice. “I’m Rafer Hoxworth, out of New Bedford, and I’m mighty glad to see you good men coming aboard. We could use some prayers on this bark.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you had a good trip?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whales are scarce,” Hoxworth replied, cocking a long leg on the railing. “Our capacity is thirty-two hundred barrels, but we have only twenty-six hundred. Rather disappointing.” Then he added, “But of course, we’ve already shipped twenty-two hundred barrels on ahead, so I don’t think the owners will be unhappy.” “Have you been away from New Bedford long?” “Coming four years,” Hoxworth replied, rubbing his powerful chin. “That’s a long time … a very long time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the oil you have, plus what you sent home . . . does make it a good trip?” Whipple pursued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, yes! Good enough so that our share will permit several of us to get married.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Including you?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Congratulations, Captain Hoxworth. Abner!” and he called his sallow-faced companion, who was already arguing salvation and temperance with some of the crew. “Abner! Captain Hoxworth’s going to get married when he gets home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The scrawny little missionary with the pale stringy hair looked up at the rugged whaler and said, “And after four years of doing whatever he wanted to in Honolulu, he now hopes to get back into Christian ways, and asks our assistance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big captain tensed his right fist and pressed his foot strongly into the railing, but kept his temper. To himself he muttered, “By God! These missionaries are all alike. All over the world. You try to meet them halfway . . .” And John Whipple thought: “Why can’t Abner just accept the day’s events as they transpire? If a whaler heading home desires a Sabbath service, why can’t we simply have the service?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Whipple heard Captain Hoxworth’s booming voice break into laughter. “Yes, Reverend . . . What was the name? Hale? Yes, Reverend Hale, you’re right. Us whalers hang our conscience on Cape Horn when we head west, and then pick ‘em up three years later when we come back home. We’d kind of like to have you ready us up for the job of catching ‘em as we glide past.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you glide past Cape Horn?” Abner asked in some confusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Certainly.” “How long did it take you to double Cape Horn coming out? Abner continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was it?” Hoxworth asked one of the men, a scowling, evil-looking rascal with a long scar across his cheek. “Oh, you weren’t with us. We picked that one up in Honolulu when our cooper jumped ship. You, Anderson! How long did it take us to double the Cape coming out?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner gasped. “You mean you got around Cape Horn in three days?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was like glass,” Captain Hoxworth boomed. “And it’ll like glass for us when we go home. We run a lucky ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s the truth!” Anderson laughed. “If there’s whales, we get ‘em.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner stood perplexed in the sunlight, trying to rationalize the fact that an obscene whaler—for he was convinced that this was a hell ship—could double the Cape in three days whereas it had taken a group of missionaries almost eight weeks, and he concluded to himself, “The mysterious ways of the Lord with His appointed are beyond understanding.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll pray aft,” Captain Hoxworth announced, leading his men and the missionaries to an afterdeck that seemed as spacious as a village common compared to the cramped Thetis.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner whispered to Whipple, “You lead the singing and the prayers, and I’ll give the sermon I gave on the other whaler,” but just as the crew began singing, “Another six days’ work is done,” the lookout bellowed, “Thar she blows!” and the assembly disintegrated, some rushing for the whaleboats, some for glasses and some up the lower rigging.</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Hoxworth’s deep-set eyes glistened as he spotted the blowing whales off beyond the Thetis, and he strode past the missionaries. “Get those boats away swiftly!” he boomed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain! Captain!” Abner protested. “We’re having hymns!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hymns hell!” Hoxworth shouted. “Them’s whales!” Grabbing a horn, he shouted directions that sent the whaleboats far out to sea and watched with his glass as they closed in upon the mammoth sperm whales that were moving along in a colony of gigantic forms.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point John Whipple faced a major decision. He knew, for he was a missionary like Abner, that since this was the Sabbath he was bound not to participate in this desecration of catching whales; but he also knew as a scientist that he might never again have a chance of watching a crew fight a great sperm whale, so after a moment’s indecision he handed Abner his tall hat and said, “I’m going up into the rigging.” Abner protested, but in vain, and during the ensuing seven exciting hours, he stood glumly aft and refused steadfastly to look at the whaling operations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Brother Whipple from his vantage point in the rigging saw the three whaleboats from the Carthaginian, each with sail aloft, a harpooner, a helmsman and four rowers, sweep down upon the massive whales.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re sparm!” Captain Hoxworth exulted. “Look at ‘em!” and he passed Whipple a telescope. In the glass John spied the enormous beasts, wallowing in the sea and spouting a mixture of water and compressed air more than fifteen feet into the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many whales are there out there?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thirty?” Hoxworth suggested cautiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many will you try to take?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll be lucky if we get one. Sparm’s smart whales.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple watched the lead boat try to sneak up on a particularly large monster, but it moved aggravatingly off, so the mate directed his whaleboat onto a substitute, a huge gray-blue sperm that lazed along in the sun. Creeping up to it from the rear and on the right side, the mate maneuvered his prow deftly into the whale’s long flank, and the harpooner, poised with left leg extended securely into the bottom of the boat, right cocked precariously against the gunwales, drew the harpoon back in his left hand and then flashed it with incredible might deep into the whale’s resistant body.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this first agonizing moment the great beast flipped out of the water, the harpoon lines trailing, and Whipple cried, “It’s bigger than the Thetis!” For the men of the Carthaginian had hooked into a mammoth whale.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’ll make eighty barrels!” a seaman cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If we take him,” Hoxworth cautioned. Grabbing the glass from Whipple, he watched the manner in which the whale plunged in its first attempt to shake off tormentors. “He’s sounded,” the captain reported ominously, waiting to see how the first mad dash of the monster would be handled by the crew.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple could see the rope whirring out of the harpooner’s tub, with a sailor poised ready with an ax to chop it free—thus losing the whale if trouble developed—and it seemed as if the leviathan must be probing the very bottom of the ocean, so much rope went out. The minutes passed, and there was no sign of the whale. The other two boats placed themselves out of the way, yet ready to assist if the whale surfaced near them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in an unexpected quarter, and not far from the Carthaginian, the whale surfaced. It came roaring up through the waves, twisted, turned, flapped its great flukes, then blew. A tower of red blood spurted high into the air, a monument of bubbling death, and poised there for a moment in the sunlight as if it were a pillar of red marble, falling back at last into the sea to make the waves crimson. Four more times the huge beast spouted its lungs’ burden of blood. Hoxworth, noting the color, shouted, “He’s well struck!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now came the most tense moment of the fight, for the anguished whale hesitated, and all knew that if it came out of this pause in the wrong direction it might stove the whaleboats, or crush them in its powerful underslung jaw, or even crash headfirst into the Carthaginian herself, sinking her within minutes, in the way many whalers had been lost. This time the whale ran true, and at a speed of thirty miles an hour, rushed through the open ocean, dragging the whaleboat along behind. Now the sail was furled and the four rowers sat with their oars aloft, while their mates aboard the Carthaginian shouted, “There goes the Nantucket sleigh ride!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In this way six men in a little rowboat fought an enormous whale to death. The beast dived and paused, spouted blood and dived again. It ran for the open sea, and doubled back, but the harpoon worked deeper into its flank, and the rope remained taut. When the whale moved close to the boat, the oarsmen worked feverishly hauling in rope; but when the beast fled, they played it out again; and in this wild red game of take in and play out, the whale began to sense that it would be the loser.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now a second whaleboat crept in, and its harpooner launched another cruel shaft of iron deep into the whale’s forward quarter, and the chase was on again, this time with two whaleboats on the sleigh ride. Swiftly, they were hauled through the bloody sea, and swiftly their ropes were brought close in when the whale rested. Back and forth, up and down the leviathan fought, blood choking his lungs and beginning to paralyze his flukes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a monster, that one!” Captain Hoxworth said approvingly. ‘Pray God he doesn’t catch one of the boats.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The minutes passed and then the quarter hours, and the whale fought on, bleeding profusely and seeking the safer depths; but always he had to surface, a great bull sperm whale in agony, until finally, after a last mighty surge through the red waves, he rolled over and was dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Got him!” Captain Hoxworth shouted, as the third whaleboat moved in to attach its line to the second, and in this manner the three crews slowly began to tow the whale back to their mother ship. The Carthaginian, meanwhile, manipulated its sails so that it could move with equal caution toward the oncoming whale.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aboard ship there was much activity. Along the starboard side a section of railing was lifted away, and a small platform was lowered six or eight feet above the surface of the sea. Men brought out razor-sharp blubber knives with twenty-foot handles. Others laboriously lugged huge iron hooks, each weighing almost as much as a man, into position for biting into the blubber and pulling it aboard. Where Abner was to have preached, the cook and his helper piled dry wood for firing the try-pots in which the whale oil would be rendered, while forward the scar-faced cooper supervised the opening of the hatch and the airing of barrels into which that blubber would be stowed that could not be immediately cooked. Just as these preparations were completed, with John Whipple noting each step in the process, and Abner Hale trying not to do so because all was being done on a Sunday, the whale was brought alongside and Whipple cried, “It’s longer than the Thetis,” but Captain Hoxworth, who like all whalers never referred to the length of a whale, growled, “He’ll make eighty, ninety barrels. A monster.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the great sperm was lashed to the starboard side of the Carthaginian, and when the frail platform was adjusted, a black Brava sailor, from the Cape Verdes, nimbly leaped onto the whale’s body and with a slashing knife tried to cut at the blubber so as to attach the giant hooks that were being lowered to him. Deft as he was, he could not make the enormous hooks fast, and when the Carthaginian took a sudden shift to windward, the Brava was struck in the chest by one of the swaying hooks and swept off the whale’s flank and intp the ocean, whereupon a dozen sleek sharks who had been following the blood stormed down upon him, but the men on the platform slashed and cut at the raiders and drove ithem off, so that the Brava climbed back on the whale, cursing in Portuguese, and this time, dripping in blood from whale and shark alike, he caught the brutal hooks into the blubber, and the unwinding was ready to begin. But before it could start, the whale’s great head—twenty-six feet long and weighing tons—had to be cut away and fastened to the after end of the ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You, Brava!” Captain Hoxworth shouted. “Tie this hook into the head!” And the sinewy black man leaped nimbly onto the whale’s head, securing the hook, after which his mates with extra sharp knives on long poles sawed away the mammoth head.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it drifted clear, they directed their knives to the body of the whale, slashing the thick blubbery skin in sloping spirals that started from where the head had been and ran down to the huge tail hanging limp in the sea. As the skilled workmen cut, they frequently paused for sport and slashed their deadly knives deep into some shark that had come to feed upon the carcass, and when the knife was withdrawn the shark would twist slightly, as if a bee had stung him, and continue feeding.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the men on the lines leading to heavy hooks began to haul, and slowly the whale rolled over and over upon itself while the blanket or blubber unpeeled in a huge spiral and was hauled aloft, When more than a dozen feet hung over the deck, one iron hook was cut free from the top and hooked into position lower down. Then the other was cut away and fastened beside the first, allowing the end of blubber to fall free upon the deck, where it was cut away, hacked into pieces, and thrust at first into the boiling try-pots, and when they were full, into the temporary barrels. Then the lines were hauled tight once more, and the thick blanket of blubber continued to unwind and swing aboard, as men on the swaying platform cut it free from the body of the slowly revolving whale.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last the tail was reached, and in the final moments, before the monstrous carcass was set free for the sharks, the Brava leaped back onto it and cut away a dozen steaks of fresh whale meat. “Get some liver, too,” a sailor shouted, but the Brava felt himself slipping toward the sharks, so he grabbed a line and swung himself back aboard the platform. With a final slash of their scimitar-like knives, the workmen cut the whale loose and he drifted away to the waiting sharks.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next the giant head was cut into three sections and hauled aboard, where near-naked men scooped out of its vast case more than two dozen precious barrels full of spermaceti, which would be converted into candles and cosmetics.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dusk, when the head sections, now empty of their treasure, had been dumped back into the sea where twelve hours before they had held a tiny brain which had steered the goliath through the waves, Captain Hoxworth shouted, “Through the generosity of the Lord, our prayers have been delayed. Let the fry-pots tend themselves. We’ll pray.” And he assembled all hands onto the oily deck, but Abner Hale would not participate in the services, so John Whipple conducted both the prayers and the singing and delivered an inspired sermon on a passage from the 104th Psalm: “O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! . . . The earth is full of Thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom Thou hast made to play therein. . . . The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever.” In his peroration he preached quietly: “From the turbulent deep God has raised up leviathan. From the wastes of the ocean He has brought us His riches. But from the wastes of the human ocean constantly He provides us with riches greater still, for the leviathan of man’s spirit is immeasurable and its wealth is counted not in casks or spermaceti. It is counted in love, and decency, and faith. May we who have trapped the great whale trap in our own lives the greater leviathan of understanding.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Hoxworth was visibly moved by Whipple’s sermon and shouted, “Cook! Break out some good food, and well celebrate!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We ought to be getting back to the Thetis,” Abner warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forget the Thetis!” Hoxworth boomed. “We’ll sleep here tonight.” and he led the missionaries down into his quarters, and they were stunned. The cabin was spacious, with clean green cloth npon the table. The captain’s retiring room was finished in fine mahogany and decorated with numerous examples of carved whale bone, while his sleeping quarters featured a commodious bed, furnished with clean linen and hung on gimbals, so that even though the Carthaginian rolled in a storm, its captain slept in a steady bed. Along the wall was slung a bookcase, filled with works on geography, history, the oceans and poetry. Compared to the mean and meager Thetis, this ship was luxurious.</p>

  <p class="normal">And the food was good. Captain Hoxworth said, in a low strong voice that carried his magnetism through the cabin, “We fight hard for our whales. We never finish second best, and we eat well. This is a lucky ship, and, Reverend Whipple, at the conclusion of this voyage I’ll own two thirds of her, and at the end of the next, she’ll be mine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“These are fine quarters,” Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had the mahogany put in at Manila. You see, I’m bringing my wife aboard on the next trip.” He laughed apologetically and explained, “When a captain does that, the crew calls the ship a ‘Hen Frigate.’ Some whalers won’t ship aboard a ‘Hen Frigate.’ Others prefer it. Say the food and the medicine are apt to be better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do captains’ wives ever get seasick?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A little, at first,” Hoxworth boomed. “But on a bigger ship, like this, they get over it quickly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to see Amanda and Jerusha as captains’ wives,” Whipple laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you say Jerusha?” the captain asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Jerusha Hale, Abner’s wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excellent!” the big man cried. “It’s Jerusha I’m marrying, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And he reached out to grab Aimer’s small hand. “Where’s yours from, Reverend Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Walpole, New Hampshire,” Abner replied, unhappy at mentioning his wife’s name in a whaling cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you say Walpole?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Big Rafer Hoxworth kicked back his chair and grabbed Abner by the coat. “Is Jerusha Bromley aboard that brig out there?” be asked menacingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abner replied steadily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God Almighty!” Hoxworth cried, shoving Abner back into his chair. “Andersonl Lower me a boat!” With fury clouding his face he grabbed his cap, jammed it on the back of his head, and stormed aloft. When Abner and John tried to follow he thrust them back into the cabin. “You wait here!” he thundered. “Mister Wilson!” he bellowed at his mate. “If these men try to leave this cabin, shoot “em.” And in a moment he was on the sea, driving his men toward the brig Thetis.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he swung himself aboard, refusing to wait for a ladder, Captain Janders asked, “Where are the missionaries?” but Hoxworth, dark as the night, roared, “To hell with the missionaries. Where’s Jerusha Bromley?” And he stormed down into the smelly cabin, shouting, “Jerusha! Jerusha!” When he found her sitting at the table he swept all the other missionaries together with his giant arms and roared, “Get out of here!” And when they were gone he took Jerusha’s hands and asked, “Is what they tell me true?”&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha, with an extra radiance now that she was both recovered: from seasickness and in the first happy flush of pregnancy, drew back from the dynamic man who had wooed her four years ago. Hoxworth, seeing this, slammed his powerful fist onto the table and shouted, “Almighty God, what have you done?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have gotten married,” Jerusha said firmly and without panic.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To that worm? To that miserable little . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To a wonderfully understanding man,” she said, drawing herself against a small section of the wall that separated two stateroom doors.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That goddamned puny . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rafer, don’t blaspheme.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll blaspheme this whole goddamned stinking little ship to hell before I’ll let you …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rafer, you stayed away. You never said you would marry me …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never said?” he roared, leaping over a fallen chair to grab her to him. “I wrote to you from Canton. I wrote to you from Oregon. I wrote from Honolulu. I told you that as soon as I landed in New Bedford we’d be married, and that you’d sail with me on my ship. It’ll be my ship soon, Jerusha, and you’re sailing with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rafer, I’m married. To a minister. Your letters never came.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can’t be married!” he stormed. “It’s me you love, and you know it.” He crushed her to him, and kissed her many times. “I can’t let you go!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rafer,” she said quietly, pushing him away. “You must respect my condition.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big captain fell back and looked at the girl he had been dreaming of for nearly four years. It is true that he had not, on that first wild acquaintance, asked her to marry him, but when the whales were good and his future known, he had written to her, three separate times, cautious lest any one letter not be delivered. Now she said that she was married . . . perhaps even pregnant. To a contemptible little worm with scraggly hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll kill you first!” he screamed. “By God, Jerusha, you shall never remain married . . .” And he lunged at her with a chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner!” she cried desperately, not knowing that he was absent, for she was certain that if he were aboard the Thetis, somehow he would rescue her. “Abner!” The chair crashed by her head and the wild sea captain was upon her, but before she fainted she saw Keoki and the old whaler leaping down into the cabin with hooks and clubs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, the missionaries comforted her, saying, “We heard it all, Sister Hale, and we hoped not to intervene, for he was a madman and we trusted he would recover his senses.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had to club him, Mrs. Hale,” Keoki apologized.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is he now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain Janders is taking him back to his ship,” one of the wives explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But where’s Reverend Hale?” Jerusha cried in deep love and fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s on the other ship,” Keoki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain Hoxworth will kill him!” Jerusha wailed, trying to get onto the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s why Captain Janders went along,” Keoki assured her. “With pistols.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But not even Captain Janders was able to protect Abner that night, for although Rafer Hoxworth quieted down on the cooling trip to the Carthaginian, and although he was a model of politeness to John Whipple, when he saw Abner, and how small he was and how wormy in manner, he lost control and leaped screaming at the little missionary, lifting him from the deck and rushing him to the railing of the ship, where the blubber had been taken aboard, and possibly because he slipped unexpectedly on grease, or possibly by intention, he raised Abner high into the night and flung him furiously into the dark waves.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll not keep her!” he screamed insanely. “I’ll come back to Honolulu and rip her from your arms. By God, I’ll kill you, you miserable little worm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While he was shouting, Captain Janders was desperately maneuvering his rowboat, warning his men, “After they cut a whale there’s bound to be sharks.” And the rowers saw dark forms gliding in the water, and one brushed Abner, so that he screamed with fear, “Sharks!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the dark deck of the Carthaginian, Captain Hoxworth roared, “Get him, sharks! Get him! He’s over on this side. Here he is, sharks!” And he was raging thus when John Whipple reached into the vast Pacific and pulled his brother aboard.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did the sharks get you, Abner?” he whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They took my foot . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! It’s all right, Abner. A little blood, that’s all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean my foot isn’t . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s all right, Abner,” Whipple insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I felt a shark . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, one hit at you,” Whipple said reassuringly, “but it only scraped the skin. See, these are your toes.” And the last thing Abner could remember before he fainted was John Whipple pinching his toes and from a dark distance Rafer Hoxworth screaming futilely, “Get him, sharks! He’s over there. Get the stinking little bastard and chew him up. Because if you don’t kill him I’ll have to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That was the reason why Abner Hale, twenty-two years old and dressed in solemn black, with a beaver hat nearly as tall as he was, limped as he prepared to land at the port city of Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii. The shark had not taken his foot, nor even his toes, but it had exposed the tendon and damaged it, and not even careful John Whipple could completely repair it.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>THE ACTUAL LANDING</span> of the missionaries was a confused affair, for when the Thetis drew into the famous wintering port of; Lahaina, there was great commotion on shore, and the missionaries saw with horror that many handsome young women were throwing off their clothes and beginning to swim eagerly toward the little brig, which apparently they knew favorably from the past, but the attention of the ministers was quickly diverted from the swimmers to a fine canoe which, even though it started late, soon overtook the naked swimmers and drew up alongside the Thetis. It contained a man, a completely nude woman and four attractive girls, equally nude.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We come back!” the man cried happily, boosting his women onto the little ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! No!” Keoki Kanakoa cried in a flood of embarrassment. “These are missionaries!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My girls good girls!” the father shouted reassuringly, shoving his handsome women aboard as he had done so often in the past. “Those girls swimming no good. Plenty sick.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Heavenly Father” Abner whispered to Brother Whipple. “Are they his own daughters?”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point two of the girls saw the old whaler who had saved the Thetis off the Four Evangelists, and apparently they remembered him kindly, for they ran across the deck, called him by name, and threw their arms about him, but he, seeing Jerusha Hale’s dismay, tried to brush them away as a man keeps flies from his face when he is eating.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Go back! Go back!” Keoki pleaded in Hawaiian, and gradually the four laughing daughters and their beautiful naked mother began to realize that on this ship, unlike all others, they were not wanted, and in some confusion they climbed back into the canoe, which their family had acquired by providing such services to passing ships. Sadly, the man of the house, his day’s profit gone, paddled his employees back to Lahaina, and whenever he came to groups of girls swimming to the Thetis he called in bewilderment, “Turn back! No girls are wanted!” And the convoy of island beauties sadly returned to the shore and dressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aboard the Thetis, Abner Hale, who had never before seen a naked woman, said dazedly to his brothers, “There’s going to be a lot of work to do in Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now from the shore came out two other Hawaiians of sharply different character. Abner first saw them when a large canoe, with vassals standing at stern and prow bearing yellow-feathered staffs, became the center of an extraordinary commotion. Islanders moved about in agitation as among them appeared two of the most gigantic human beings Abner had so far seen.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s my father!” Keoki Kanakoa shouted to the missionaries, and by choice he came to stand with the Hales, repeating to Abner, “The tall man is my father, guardian of the king’s estates.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought he was King of Maui,” Abner remarked with disappointment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I never said so,” Keoki replied. “The people in Boston did. They thought it impressed the Americans.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is the woman?” Jerusha inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My mother. She’s the highest chief in the islands. When my father wants to ask her a question of state, he has to crawl into the room on his hands and knees. So do I.” Along the railing the missionaries studied the enormous woman who half climbed, half relaxed as her subjects heaved her fantastic bulk into the canoe. Keoki’s mother was six feet four inches tall, stately, long-haired, noble in every aspect, and weighed three hundred and twenty pounds. Her massive foreams were larger than the bodies of many men, while her gigantic middle, swathed in many layers of richly patterned tapa, seemed more like the trunk of some forest titan than of a human being. By her bulk alone it could be seen that she was a chief, but her most conspicuous features were her two splendid breasts, which hung in massive brown grandeur above the soft red and yellow tapa. The missionary men stared in wonder; the women gazed in awe.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We call her the Alii Nui,” Keoki whispered reverently, pronouncing the title Alee-ee. “It is from her that our mana flows.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner looked at his young Christian friend in amazement, as if some foul error had corrupted him. “It is from God and not from an alii nui that your spiritual consecration flows,” he corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">The young Hawaiian blushed, and with attractive candor explained, “When you have lived a long time with one idea, you sometimes express better ideas in the same careless way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again Abner frowned, as if his labors with Keoki were being proved futile. “God isn’t what you call a better idea, Keoki,” he said firmly. “God is a superlative fact. He stands alone and brooks no comparisons. You don’t worship God merely because He represents a better idea.” Abner spoke contemptuously, but Keoki, with tears of considerable joy in his eyes, did not recognize that fact and accepted the words in love.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sorry, Brother Hale,” he said contritely. “I used the word thoughtlessly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think it would be better, Keoki,” Abner reflected, “if from now on you referred to me in the old way. Reverend Hale. Your people might not understand the title Brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha interrupted and asked, “Didn’t we agree that we were to call one another Brother and Sister?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That was among ourselves, Mrs. Hale,” Abner explained patiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Isn’t Keoki one of ourselves?” Jerusha pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think the term ourselves refers principally to ordained ministers and their wives,” Abner judged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When you have been ordained, Keoki, it’ll be Brother Abner,” Jerusha assured the young Hawaiian. “But even though you are not yet ordained, Keoki, I am your Sister Jerusha.” And she stood beside him and said, “Your father and mother are handsome people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With great dignity, and with yellow feathers on the staffs fluttering in the wind, the long canoe approached the Thetis, and for the first time the Hales saw the full majesty of Keoki’s father. Not so large in bulk as the Alii Nui, he was nevertheless taller—six feet seven—and of striking presence. His hair was a mixture of black and gray. His brown face was cut by deep lines of thought and his expressive eyes shone out from beneath heavy brows. He was dressed in a cape of yellow feathers and a skirt of red tapa, but his most conspicuous ornament was a feathered helmet, close-fitting to the head but with a narrow crest of feathers that started at the nape of the neck, sweeping over the back of the head and reaching well in front of the forehead. By some mysterious trick of either history or the human mind, Kelolo, Guardian of the King’s Estates, wore exactly the same kind of helmet as had Achilles, Ajax and Agamemnon, but because his people had never discovered metals, his was of feathers whereas theirs had been of iron.</p>

  <p class="normal">Seeing his tall son on the deck of the Thetis, giant Kelolo deftly grabbed a rope as it was lowered to him, and with swift movements sprang from the canoe onto a footing along the starboard side of the Thetis and then adroitly onto the deck. Abner gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He must weigh nearly three hundred pounds!” he whispered to Jerusha, but she had now joined Keoki in tears, for the affectionate manner in which giant Kelolo and his long-absent son embraced, rubbed noses and wept reminded her of her own parents, and she held her lace handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally Keoki broke away and said, “Captain Janders! My father wishes to pay his respects,” and the tough New England sea captain came aft to acknowledge the greeting. Kelolo, proud of having learned from earlier ships how properly to greet a westerner, thrust out his powerful right hand, and as Captain Janders took it, he saw tattooed from wrist to shoulder the awkward letters: “Tamehameha King.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can your father write in English?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki shook his head and spoke rapidly in Hawaiian. When Kelolo replied, the son said, “One of the Russians did this for my father. In 1819, when our great king Kamehameha died.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why did he spell it Tamehameha?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our language is just now being written for the first time,” Keoki explained. “The way you Americans have decided to spell it is neither right nor wrong. My father’s name you spell Kelolo. It would be just as right to spell it Teroro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean the truth lies somewhere in between?” Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Eagerly Keoki grasped the captain’s hand and pumped it, as if the latter had said something which had suddenly illuminated a difficult problem. “Yes, Captain,” the young man said happily. “In these matters the truth does lie somewhere in between.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea was repugnant to Abner, particularly since he had been increasingly worried about Keoki’s apparent reversion to paganism as Hawaii neared. “There is always only one truth,” the young missionary corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki willingly assented, explaining, “In matters of God, of course there is only one truth, Reverend Hale. But in spelling my father’s name, there is no final truth. It lies between Kelolo and Teroro and is neither.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keoki,” Abner said patiently, “a committee of missionaries, well versed in Greek, Hebrew and Latin studied in Honoruru for more than a year deciding how to spell Hawaiian names. They didn’t act in haste or ignorance, and they decided that your father’s name should be spelled Kelolo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Thoughtlessly Keoki pointed out: “They also decided the town should be called Honolulu, but its real name is closer to Honoruru, as you said.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner flushed and was about to utter some sharp correction when Captain Janders rescued the moment by admiringly grasping Kelolo’s tattooed arm and observing, “Tamehameha! A very great king. Alii Nui Nui!</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo, confused by the earlier argument, smiled broadly and returned the compliment. Patting the railing of the Thetis he said in Hawaiian, “This is a very fine ship. I shall buy this ship for Malama, the Alii Nui, and you, Captain Janders, shall be our captain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was translated by Keoki, Captain Janders did not laugh, but looked steadily at Kelolo and nodded sagely. “Ask him how much sandalwood he can bring me for the ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have been saving my sandalwood,” Kelolo said cautiously. “There is much more in the mountains of Maui. I can get the sandalwood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him that if he can get the sandalwood, I can get the ship.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kelolo heard the news he started to shake hands in the American manner, but cautiounsly Captain Janders held back. “Tell him that he does not get the Thetis until I have carried the sandalwood to Canton and brought back a load of Chinese goods, which shall be my property to sell.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That is reasonable,” Kelolo agreed, and once more he proudly held forth his hand to bind the bargain. This time Captain Jandeis grasped it, adding prudently, “Mister Collins, draw up an agreement in three copies. State that we will sell the Thetis for a full cargo of sandalwood now, plus an equal amount when we return from China.” When the terms were translated, Kelolo solemnly agreed, whereupon Mister Collins whispered, “That’s a hell of a lot of sandalwood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Replied Janders, “This is a hell of a lot of ship. It’s a fair deal.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While the towering chief was concluding the deal, Abner had an opportunity to study him closely, and his eye was attracted to the symbol of power that Kelolo wore about his brown neck. From a very thick, dark necklace, apparently woven of some tree fiber, dangled a curiously shaped chunk of ivory, about five inches long and an inch and a half wide, but what was remarkable was the manner in which, at the bottom, a lip flared out and up, so that the entire piece resembled an antique adz for shaping trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” Abner whispered to Keoki.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The mark of an alii,” Keoki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s it made of?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A whale’s tooth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It must be heavy to wear,” Abner suggested, whereupon Keoki took the missionary’s hand and thrust it under the tooth, so that Abner could test the surprising weight.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the old days,” Keoki laughed, “you would be killed for touching an alii.” Then he added, “The weight doesn’t bother him because the necklace of human hair supports it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that hair?” Abner gasped, and again Keoki passed his friend’s hand over the woven necklace, which, Keoki explained, had been made of some two thousand separate braids of plaited hair, each braid having been woven from eighty individual pieces of hair. “The total length of hair,” Abner began. “Well . . . it’s impossible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And all from the heads of friends,” Keoki said proudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Before Abner could comment on this barbarism a considerable commotion occurred at the side of the Thetis and the missionaries ran to witness an extraordinary performance. From the mainmast two stout ropes had been lowered over the canoe which still held Malama, the Alii Nui. The ends of the ropes were fastened to a rugged canvas sling that was customarily slipped under the bellies of horses and cows, hoisting them in this fashion onto the deck of the ship. Today, the canvas sling was being used as a giant cradle into which the men in the canoe gently placed their revered chief, crosswise, so that her feet and arms dangled over the edges of the canvas, which insured her stability, while her enormous chin rested on the hard rope binding which kept the canvas from tearing.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is she all settled?” Captain Janders asked solicitously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s squared away,” a sailor shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t drop her!” Janders warned. “Or we’ll be massacred.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Gently! Gently!” the men working the ropes chanted, and slowly the gigantic Alii Nui was swung aboard the Thetis. As her big dark eyes, ablaze with childish curiosity, reached the top of the railing, while her chin rested on the edge of the canvas and her body sprawled happily behind, she waved her right hand in a grand gesture of welcome and allowed her handsome features to break into a contented smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Aloha! Aloha! Aloha!” she said repeatedly in a low, soft voice, her expressive eyes sweeping the row of black-frocked missionaries in their claw-hammer coats. But her warmest greeting was for the skinny yet attractive young women who stood sedately in the rear. It would have taken almost four Amanda Whipples to equal the bulk of this giant woman as she lay in the canvas sling. “Aloha! Aloha!” she kept crying in her musical voice as she swung over the women.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For the love of God!” Janders shouted. “Take it easy now. Gently! Gently!” As the ropes were eased over the capstans, the canvas sling slowly dropped toward the deck. Instantly, Captain Janders, Kelolo and Keoki rushed forward to intercept the sling, lest the Alii Nui be bruised in landing, but her bulk was so ponderous that in spite of their efforts to hold the sling off the deck, it pressed its way resolutely down, forcing the men to their knees and finally to a sprawling position. Undisturbed, the noble woman rolled over on the canvas, found her footing, and rose to majestic height, her bundles of tapa making her seem even larger than she was. Quietly, she passed down the line of missionaries, greeting each with her musical “Aloha! Aloha!” But when she came to the storm-tossed women, whose voyage she could imagine and whose underweight she instantly perceived, she could not restrain herself and broke into tears. Gathering little Amanda Whipple to her great bosom she wept for some moments, then rubbed noses with her as if she were a daughter. Moving to each of the women in turn, she continued her weeping and smothered them in her boundless love.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Aloha! Aloha!” she repeated. Then, facing the women and ignoring their husbands as she did her own, she spoke softly, and when her son interpreted the words, they said: “My adorable little children, you must think of me always as your mother. Before, the white men have sent us only sailors and shopkeepers and troublemakers. Never any women. But now you come, so we know that the intentions of the Americans must at last be good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama, the Alii Nui, the most sacred, mana-filled human being on Maui, waited grandly while this greeting was being delivered, and when the missionary wives acknowledged it, she moved down the line again, rubbing noses with each of the women and repeating, “You are my daughter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, overcome both by the emotion and the exertions of getting aboard the Thetis, Malama, her great moon-face sublime in new-found comfort, slowly unfastened the tapas that bound her great bulk. Handing the ends to her servants, she ordered them to walk away from her, while she unwound like a top until she stood completely naked except for a hair necklace from which dangled a single majestic whale’s tooth. Scratching herself in gasping relief, she indicated that she would lie down, and chose the canvas sling as a likely place, but when she stretched out on her stomach the missionaries were appalled to see tattooed along the full length of her left ham the purple letters: “Tamehameha King Died 1819.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did the Russians do that, too?” Captain Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They must have,” Keoki replied. He asked his mother about the memento, and she twisted her head to study it. Tears came into her eyes and Keoki explained. “She was the nineteenth wife of Kamehameha the Great.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha gasped, “Why she was no better than a concubine!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In many ways,” Keoki continued, “Malama was the favorite of the king’s last years. Of course, since she was the Alii Nui, she was entitled to other husbands as well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean she was married to your father … at the same time?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Keoki explained. “Kamehameha himself consented, because my father was her younger brother, and their marriage was essential.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Throw some water on that woman!” Captain Janders shouted, for one of the missionary wives, overcome by Malama’s nudity and marital complications, had fainted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki, sensing the reasons, went to his mother and whispered that she ought to cover herself, for Americans hated the sight of the human body, and the great sprawling woman assented. “Tell them,” she said enthusiastically, “that henceforth I shall dress like them.” But before Keoki could do this she quietly asked Captain Janders if he could provide her with some fire, and when a brazier was fetched she fed into its flames the tapas she had been wearing. When they were consumed she announced grandly: “Now I shall dress as the new women do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who will make your dress?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Imperiously, Malama pointed to Jerusha and Amanda and said, “You and you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell her you’d be happy to,” Abner hastily whispered, and the two missionary women bowed and said, “We will make your dress, Malama, but we have not so much cloth, because you are a very big woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t make her angry,” Abner warned, but Malama’s quick intelligence had caught the burden of Jerusha’s meaning, and she laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In all your little dresses,” she cried, indicating the mission women with a sweep of her mighty arm, “there is not enough cloth for my dress.” And she signaled her servants to fetch bundles from the canoe, and before the startled eyes of the mission women, length after length of the choicest Chinese fabric was unrolled. Settling finally on a brilliant red and a handsome blue, she pointed to the housedress worn by Amanda Whipple and announced quietly, “When I return to shore, I shall be dressed like that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Having given the command, she went to sleep, her naked bulk protected from flies by servants who swept her constantly with leathered wands. When she woke, Captain Janders inquired if she ‘would like some ship’s food, but she refused haughtily and ordered her servants to lift great calabashes of food from the canoe, so that while the mission wives perspired over the tentlike dress they were building, she reclined and feasted on gigantic portions of roast pig, breadfruit, baked dog, fish and three quarts of purple poi. Midway in the meal her attendants hammered her stomach in ancient massage rituals so that she could consume more, and during these interruptions she grunted happily as the food was manipulated into more comfortable positions inside her cavernous belly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki explained proudly, “The Alii Nui has to eat huge meals, five or six times a day, so that the common people will see from a distance that she is a great woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Into the evening the missionary women sewed while their husbands prayed that Malama would receive them well and allow them to lodge a mission at Lahaina; but the seamen of the Thetis prayed no less devoutly that soon both the missionaries and the fat woman would leave so that the girls waiting anxiously on shore could swim out to the brig and take up their accustomed work.</p>

  <p class="normal">At ten the next morning the enormous red and blue dress was finished, and Malama accepted it without even bothering to thank the mission women, for she lived in a world in which all but she were servants. Like an awning protecting a New England store, the great dress was lowered into position over her dark head, while her streams of black hair were pulled outside and allowed to flow down her back. The buttons were fastened; adjustments were made at the waist, and the great Alii Nui jumped up and down several times to fit herself into the strange new uniform. Then she smiled broadly and said to her son, “Now I am a Christian woman!”</p>

  <p class="normal">To the missionaries she said, “We have waited long for you to help us. We know that there is a better way of living, and we seek instruction from you. In Honolulu the first missionaries are already teaching our people to read and write. In Maui I shall be your first pupil.” She counted on her fingers and announced firmly: “In one moon, mark this, Keoki, I will write my name and send it to Honolulu . . . with a message.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a moment of profound decision, and all aboard the Thetis save one were impressed with the gravity of this powerful woman’s determination; but Abner Hale perceived that Malama’s decision, while notable in that an illiterate heathen of her own will sought instruction, was nevertheless a step in the wrong direction, so he moved before her and said quietly, “Malama, we do not bring you only the alphabet. We have not come here merely to teach you how to write your name. We bring you the word of God, and unless you accept this, nothing that you will ever write will be of significance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the words were translated to Malama her enormous moon face betrayed no emotion. Forcefully she said, “We have our own gods. It is the words, the writing that we need.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Writing without God is useless,” Abner stubbornly reiterated, his little blond head coming scarcely to Malama’s throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have been told,” Malama answered with equal firmness, “that writing helps the entire world, but the white man’s God helps the white man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have been told wrong,” Abner insisted, thrusting his stubborn little face upward.</p>

  <p class="normal">To everyone’s surprise Malama did not reply to this but moved to face the women, asking, “Which one is the wife of this little man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Jerusha said proudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama was pleased, for she had observed how capably Jerusha managed the work of making the big dress, and she announced: “For the first moon, this one shall teach me how to read and write, and for the next, this one,” indicating Abner, “shall teach me the new religion. If I find that these two new learnings are of equal importance, after two moons I shall advise you’.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nodding to the assembly, she went gravely to the canvas commanding her servants to unbutton her dress and remove it. Then she ordered Jerusha to show her how to fold it, and in massive naked-ness lay down crosswise upon the canvas, her feet dangling aft, her arms forward, with her chin resting upon the rope edging. The capstans groaned. The sailors hefted the ropes and swung them over the eaves, and Captain Janders shouted, “For Christ’s sake, things are going well. Don’t drop her now!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Inch by inch the precious burden was lowered into the canoe until finally the Alii Nui was rolled off the canvas and helped into an upright position. Clutching the new dress to her cheek she cried in full voice, “You may now come ashore!” And as the ship’s boats were lowered to convey the missionaries to their new homes, they fell in line behind Malama’s canoe, with its two standard-bearers fore and aft, its eager servants brushing away the flies, and with tall, naked Malama holding the dress close to her.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Prior to Malama’s arbitrary choice of the Hales as her mentors, there had been some uncertainty as to which missionaries should be assigned to Maui and which to the other islands, but now it was apparent that the first choice, at least, had been made, and as the boats neared shore, Abner studied the intriguing settlement to which he was now committed. He saw one of the fairest villages in the Pacific, ancient Lahaina, capital of Hawaii, its shore marked by a fine coral strand upon which long waves broke in unceasing thunder, their tall crests breaking forward in dazzling whiteness. Where the surf finally ended, naked children played, their teeth gleaming in the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now for the first time Abner saw a coconut palm, the wonder of the tropics, bending into the wind on a slim resilient trunk and maintaining, no one knew how, its precarious foothold on the shore. Behind the palms were orderly fields reaching away to the hills, so that all of Lahaina looked like one vast, rich, flowering garden.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Those darker trees are breadfruit,” Keoki explained. “They feed us, but it’s the stubby ones with the big heads that I used to miss in Boston . . . the kou trees with their wonderful shade for a hot land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha joined them and said, “Seeing the gardens and the flowers, I think I am at last in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And Keoki replied proudly, “The garden you are looking at is my home. There where the little stream runs into the sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner and Jerusha tried to peer beneath the branches of the kou trees that lined the land he spoke of, but they could see little. “Are those grass houses?” Abner queried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Keoki explained. “Our compound holds nine or ten little houses. How beautiful it seems from the sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s the stone platform?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where the gods rested,” Keoki said simply.</p>

  <p class="normal">In horror Abner stared at the impressive pile of rocks. He could see blood dripping from them and heathen rites. He mumbled a short prayer to himself, “God protect us from the evil of heathen ways,” then asked in a whisper, “Is that where the sacrifices . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There?” Keoki laughed. “No, that’s just for the family gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The boy’s laugh infuriated Abner. It seemed strange to him that as long as Keoki remained in New England, lecturing to church audiences about the horrors of Hawaii, he had sound ideas regarding religion, but as soon as he approached his evil homeland, the edge of his conviction was blunted. “Keoki,” Abner said solemnly, “all heathen idols are an abomination to the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki wanted to cry, “But those aren’t idols . . . not gods like Kane and Kanaloa,” but as a well-trained Hawaiian he knew that he should not argue with a teacher, so he contented himself with saying quietly, “Those are the friendly little personal gods of my family. For example, sometimes the goddess Pele comes to talk with my father . . .” With some embarrassment he realized how strange this must sound, so he did not go on to explain that sharks also sometimes came along the shore to talk with Malama. “I don’t think Reverend Hale would understand,” he thought sadly to himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">To hear a young man who hoped some day to become an ordained minister speak in defense or heathen practices was unbearable to Abner, and he turned away in silence, but this act seemed cowardice to him, so he returned to the young Hawaiian and said bluntly “We shall have to remove the stone platform. In this world there is room either for God or for heathen idols. There cannot be room for both.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are right!” Keoki agreed heartily. “We have come to root out these old evils. But I am afraid that Kelolo will not permit us to remove the platform.”&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Abner asked coldly.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because he built it.”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Abner pressed.&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“My family used to live on the big island, Hawaii. We had ruled there for countless generations. It was my father who came here to Maui . . . one of Kamehameha’s most trusted generals. Kamehameha gave him most of Maui, and the first thing Kelolo did was to build the platform you saw. He insists that Pele, the volcano goddess comes there to warn him.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“The platform will have to go. Pele is no more.”&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“The big brick building,” Keoki interrupted, pointing to a rugged edifice rising at the end of the stunted pier that edged cautiously out to sea, “is Kamehameha’s old palace. Behind it is the royal taro patch. Then, you see the road beyond? That’s where the foreign sailors live. Your house will probably be erected there.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are there Europeans in the village?”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Castaways, drunks. I worry about them much more than I do about my father’s stone platform.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner ignored this thrust, for his eyes were now attracted by the most conspicuous feature of Lahaina. Behind the capital, rising in gentle yet persistent slopes, cut by magnificent valleys and reaching into dominant peaks, stood the mountains of Maui, majestic and close to the sea. Except for the ugly hills at Tierra del Fuego, Abner had never before seen mountains, and their conjunction with the sea made them memorable, so that he exclaimed, “These are the handiwork of the Lord! I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills!” And he was overcome by an urge to say a prayer of thanksgiving to a Lord who had created such beauty, so that when the little mission band stepped ashore for the first time on the beach at Lahaina, he convoked a meeting, smoothed out his claw-hammered coat, took off his beaver hat, and lifted his sallow face toward the mountains, praying: “Thou hast brought us through the storms and planted our feet upon a heathen land. Thou hast charged us with the will to bring these lost souls to Thy granary. We are unequal to the task, but we beseech Thee to give us Thy constant aid.”&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">The missionaries then raised their voices in the hymn that had recently come to summarize such efforts around the world, “From Greenland’s icy mountains,” and when the surging second verse was reached, each sang as if it had been written with Hawaii alone in mind:</p>

  <p class="normal">&#160;&#160; <em>“What though the spicy breezes</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; Tho’ every prospect pleases,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; And only man is vile;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; In vain with lavish kindness</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; The gifts of God are strown.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; The heathen in his blindness</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>&#160;&#160;&#160; Bows down to wood and stone.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">It was unfortunate that this was the first hymn to be sung in Lahaina, for it crystallized a fundamental error in Abner’s thinking. As long as he lived he would visualize Lahaina as a place “where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile.” He would perpetually think of the Hawaiian as both heathen and blind; and now, as the singing ended, Abner saw that he and his mission band were surrounded by a huge crowd of naked savages, and he was instinctively afraid, so that he and his friends huddled together for mutual protection.</p>

  <p class="normal">Actually, no missionaries in history had so far visited a gentler or finer group of people than these Hawaiians. They were clean, free from repulsive tropical diseases, had fine teeth, good manners, a wild joy in living; and they had devised a well-organized society; but to Abner they were vile.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Almighty God!” he prayed. “Help us to bring light to these cruel hearts. Give us the strength to strike down each heathen idol in this land where only man is vile.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha, however, was thinking: “Soon these people will be reading. We will teach them how to sew and to clothe themselves against the storm. Lord, keep us strong, for there is so much work to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The prayers were broken by the noise of men running up with a canoe, one that had never touched the sea, for it was carried aloft by ten huge men with poles on their shoulders. With ceremony they deposited it before Malama and she climbed in, for since the Hawaiians had not discovered the wheel they had no carriages. Standing aloft, Malama unfolded her new dress and ordered her servants to slip its enormous folds over her head. As it cascaded past her huge breasts and the tattooed shank with its memory of Kamehameha, the Alii Nui wiggled several times and felt the blue and red master-piece fall into place. “Makai! Makai!” squealed the women in the crowd, approving their Alii Nui in her new garb.&#160;&#160; “From now on I shall dress like this!” she announced solemnly. “In one moon I am going to write a letter to Honolulu, because I have good teachers.” Reaching down, she touched Abner and Jerusha, indicating that they must join her in the canoe. “This man is my teacher of religion, Makua Hale,” she announced, and in Hawaiian style she called his name Halley, by which he was known thereafter, “And this is my teacher of words, Hale Wahine. Now we will build my teachers a house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The bearers raised the canoe aloft, adjusted the poles to their shoulders, and at the head of a mighty procession containing feathered staffs, drums, court attendants and more than five thousand naked Hawaiians, the Hales set forth on their first magical journey through Lahaina, with Keoki trotting along beside the canoe, interpreting for his mother as she identified the subtle beauties of her island.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are now passing the royal taro patch,” Keoki explained. “This little stream brings us our water. This field is a choice location, because it has so many fine trees, and this is where Malama says we are to build your house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The bearers carried the Alii Nui to the four corners of the proposed dwelling, and at each she dropped a stone, whereupon servants began immediately to lay out a grass house, but before they had accomplished much,&#160; Malama grandly indicated that the procession must now move to her palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is the main road,” Malama pointed out. “Toward the sea are the fine lands where the alii live. Toward the mountains are lands for the people. In this great park lives the king when he is in residence.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are all those little grass buildings . . . like dog houses?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">When his question was interpreted, Malama laughed vigorously and said, “Those are the people’s houses!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They don’t look big enough to live in,” Abner argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The common people don’t live in them . . . not like the alii in their big house,” Malama explained. “They keep their tapa in them . . . sleep in them if it rains.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where do they live the rest of the time?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Spreading her huge arms grandiloquently to embrace the entire countryside, Malama replied, “They live under the trees, beside the rivers, in the valleys.” And before Abner could reflect on this, the canoe came to a spacious and beautiful park, set off by a wall of coral blocks three feet high, inside of which stretched an extensive garden of flowers and fruit trees, interspersed with a dozen grass houses and one large pavilion looking out over the sea. It was to this building that Malama and the Hales were carried, and as the huge woman climbed out of the canoe, she announced: “This is my palace. You will always be welcome here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She led the way into a cool spacious room outlined by woven grass walls, handsome wooden pillars and a narrow doorway which permitted a view of the sea. The floor was made of fine white pebbles covered by pandanus matting, upon which Malama with a gasp of relief threw herself, propping her big chin on her hands and stating firmly, “Now teach me to write!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha, who could not even recall how she herself had been taught, sixteen remote years ago, stammered, “I am sorry, Malama, but we need pens and papers . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her protests were silenced by a voice as soft as polished bronze, “You will teach me to write,” Malama commanded with terrifying majesty.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Malama.” Jerusha trembled. Looking about the room, she happened to see some long sticks with which Malama’s women had been beating intricate designs onto tapa and beside them several small calabashes of dark dye. Taking one of the sticks and a length of tapa, she smeared out the word <span>MALAMA</span>. As the giant woman studied Jerusha explained, “That is your name.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Keoki translated this, Malama rose and inspected the word from varying angles, repeating it proudly to herself. Grabbing the stick rudely, she splashed it in the dye and started to trace the cryptic symbols, sensing fully the magic they contained. With remarkable skill she reproduced the word exactly. “Malama!” she repeated a dozen times. Then she drew the word again and again. Suddenly she stopped and asked Keoki, “If I sent this word to Boston, would people there know that it was my word, Malama?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You could send it anywhere in the world and people would know that it was your word,” her son assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am learning to write!” the huge woman exulted. “Soon I shall send letters to all the world. The only difference between white men who rule everything and us Hawaiians is that white men can write. Now I shall write, too, and I will understand everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This error was too profound for Abner to tolerate, and he interjected, “I warned you once, Malama, that a woman can learn to write words, but they are nothing. Malama, I warn you again! Unless you learn the Commandments of the Lord, you have learned nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The walls of the grass house were thick, and not much light entered the area where Malama stood with her length of stick, and in the shadows she seemed like the gigantic summary of all Hawaiians: powerful, resolute, courageous. Once on Hawaii in the days of her husband Kamehameha’s war she had strangled a man much larger than the puny, sallow-faced individual who stood before her, and she was constrained now to brush him aside as her servant brushed away the flies, but she was impressed by his dogged insistence and by the power of his voice. More important, she suspected that he was right; the mere trick of writing was too easy; there must be additional hidden magic that enforced it; and she was about to listen to the little man with the limp, when he pointed his finger at her and shouted, “Malama, do not learn merely the outlines of the words. Learn also what they mean!” His manner was insufferable, and with a sweep of her immense right arm, thicker than his entire body, she knocked him off his feet. Returning to the tapa she wrote furiously, splashing her name across it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can write my name!” she exulted, but even as she did so, Abner’s persuasive words plagued her, and abruptly she threw down the stick and went to where he lay sprawled on the tapa. Kneeling beside him, she studied his face for a long time, then said softly, “I think you speak the truth, Makua Hale. Wait, Makua Hale. When I have learned to write, then I will come to you.” Then she ignored him and in her silky voice commanded Jerusha: “Now teach me to write.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The lesson continued for three hours, until Jerusha grew faint and would have stopped. “No!” Malama commanded. “I have not much time to waste. Teach me to write!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am growing dizzy in the heat,” Jerusha protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fan her!” Malama ordered, and when the young woman indicated that she must halt, Malama pleaded: “Hale Wahine, while we waste time, men who can read and write are stealing our islands. I cannot wait. Please.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama,” Jerusha said weakly, “I am going to have a baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Keoki explained the meaning of these words to Malama the great Alii Nui underwent a transformation. Thrusting Abner from the large room, she ordered her servants to carry Jerusha to an area where more than fifty of the finest tapas had been piled to make a day bed. When the slim girl had been placed on the pile, Malama swiftly felt for her stomach and judged, “Not for many months,” but without Keoki in the room she could not explain this conclusion to the white woman. She could see, however, that Jerusha was exhausted and she blamed herself for what had been a lack of consideration. Calling for water, she ordered Jerusha’s white face bathed and then lifted her in her arms, a mere child against her own huge bulk. Rocking back and forth, she nursed the tired mission woman to sleep, then placed her once more gently on the tapas. Rising quietly she tiptoed to where Abner waited and asked in a whisper, “Can you also teach me to write?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abner said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teach me!” she commanded, and she kneeled beside the little New England missionary as he began logically, “To write my language requires twenty-six different letters, but you are fortunate, because to write your language requires only thirteen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him to teach me the twenty-six!” she commanded Keoki. “But to write Hawaiian you need only thirteen,” Abner explained. “Teach me the twenty-six” she said softly. “It is to your country-men that I wish to write.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A, B, C,” Abner began, continuing with the lesson until he, too, felt faint.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN THE TIME CAME</span> for the Thetis to depart, almost the entire population of Lahaina appeared to bid the ship farewell and the foreshore was dark with naked bronzed bodies following each movement of the department missionaries. At last the twenty who would go to other locations assembled at the small stone pier to sing their sweet blend of mournfulness and hope, “Blest be the tie that binds,” and as their dedicated voices rose in unison, the watching Hawaiians could detect not only an inviting melody but a spirit of the new god of whom Abner Hale and their own Keoki Kanakoa had already begun to preach. When the hymn spoke of tears, the eyes obliged, and soon the vast congregation, led by the missionaries, was weeping.</p>

  <p class="normal">In one respect the sorrow was not formal but real. When Abner and Jerusha watched John Whipple prepare to sail they could not mask their apprehension, for he was the only doctor in the islands, and with him absent, Jerusha knew that when her term of pregnancy was ended, the success of her childbirth would depend upon how well her youthful husband had mastered his book lessons. Whipple, sensing this concern, promised, “Sister Jerusha, I shall do everything possible to return to Maui to help you. But remember that on the other end of the island Brother Abraham and Sister Urania will be living, and since her time does not coincide with yours, perhaps you shall be able to visit by canoe and help each other.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you will try to come back?” Jerusha pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will do my best,” Whipple swore.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha Hale and Urania Hewlett then sought out each other and’ shook hands solemnly:&#160; “When the time comes, we’ll help each other.” But they knew that they would be separated by miles of mountains and by treacherous seas.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the wailing increased, for from the shaded road that led southward to the homes of the alii, Malama’s canoe advanced, borne on the shoulders of her men, and she, dressed in blue and red, wept more than any. Descending from her strange palanquin, she moved to each of the departing missionaries and said, “If elsewhere in the islands you find no home, come back to Lahaina, for you are my children.” Then she kissed each in turn, and wept anew. But the gravity of the situation was somewhat marred by the fact that as the mission people rowed out to the Thetis they met, swimming back, more than a dozen naked girls, their long black hair trailing in the blue waters; and when they reached shore, each carrying a hand mirror—more precious here than silver in Amsterdam—or some lengths of ribbon or a hammer which they had stolen, Malama greeted them exactly as affectionately as she had the departing Christians.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, to the eastward where stout waves broke on the coral reef, thundering shoreward in long undulant swells whose tips were spumed in white, the missionaries witnessed for the first time one of the mysteries of the islands. Tall men and women, graceful as gods, stood on narrow boards and by deftly moving their feet and the gravity of their bodies, directed the boards onto the upper slopes of the breaking waves, until at last they sped with frightening swiftness over the waters. And when the wave died on the coral beach, somehow the swimmer and his board subsided back into the water, as if each were a part of the Hawaiian sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s unbelievable!” Dr. Whipple cried. “The momentum creates the balance,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could a white man do that?” Amanda asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” her husband replied, excited by the vicarious sense of speed and control created by the deft athletes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could you do it?” Amanda pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m going to do it,” John replied, “as soon as we get to Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the older missionaries frowned at this intelligence, marking it down as one more proof of their doctor’s essentially trivial attitude toward life, but his adverse opinion was not reported to his companions, because from a point forward of the Thetis a new board swept into view, and this one bore not a mere swimmer, but a nymph, a nude symbolization of all the pagan islands in the seven seas. She was a tall girl with sun-shot black hair streaming behind her in the wind. She was not grossly fat like her sisters but slim and supple, and as she stood naked on the board her handsome breasts and long firm legs seemed carved of brown marble, yet she was agile, too, for with exquisite skill she moved her knees and adjusted her shoulders so that her skimming board leaped faster than the others, while she rode it with a more secure grace. To the missionaries she was a terrifying vision, the personification of all they had come to conquer. Her nakedness was a challenge, her beauty a danger, her way of life an abomination and her existence an evil.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is she? Dr. Whipple whispered, in hushed amazement at her skill.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Her name Noelani,” proudly explained a Hawaiian who had shipped on whalers and who had mastered the barbarous pidgin of the seaports. “Wahine b’long Malama. Bimeby she gonna be Alii Nui.” And as he spoke the wave subsided near the shore; the fleet rider and her board died away from vision and returned to the sea, yet even when the missionaries looked away they could see her provocative presence, the spirit of the pagan island, riding the waves, so that a blasphemous thought came to the mind of John Whipple. He was tempted to express it, but fought it down, knowing that none would understand his meaning, but at last he had to speak and in a whisper he observed to his tiny wife: “Apparently there are many who can walk upon the waters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Amanda Whipple, a truly devout woman, heard these strange words and caught their full savor. At first she was afraid to look at her scientifically minded husband, for sometimes his thoughts were difficult to follow, but the implications of this blasphemous conclusion no one could escape, and at last she turned to look at John Whipple, thinking: “One person can never understand another.” But instead of censuring the young doctor for his irregular thoughts she looked at him analytically for the first time. Coldly, dispassionately, carefully, she looked at this strange cousin who stood beside her in the hot Hawaiian sunlight, and when she was finished studying him, she loved him more than ever.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not like such words, John,” she admonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had to speak them,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do so, always, but only to me,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will be very difficult to understand these islands,” John reflected, and as he and his wife watched the sea, they noticed the nymph Noelani—the Mists of Heaven—paddling her board back out to the deeper ocean where the big waves formed. Kneeling on her polished plank, she bent over so that her breasts almost touched the board. Then, with powerful movements of her long arms, she swept her hands through the water and her conveyance shot through the waves faster than the missionary boat was being rowed. Her course brought her close to the Thetis, and as she passed, she smiled. Then, selecting a proper wave, she quickly maneuvered her board, and finding it properly oriented, rose on one knee. From the missionary boat John Whipple whispered to his wife, “Now she will walk upon the waters.” And she did.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Thetis sailed, Abner and Jerusha, feeling dismally alone, had an opportunity to inspect the house in which their labors for the next years would be conducted. Its corner posts were stout trees from the mountains, but its sides and roof were of tied grass. The floor was pebbled and covered with pandanus, to be swept by a broom of rushes, but its windows were mere openings across which cloth from China had been hung. It was a squat, formless grass hut with no divisions into rooms. It had no bed, no chairs, no table, no closets, but it did have two considerable assets: at the rear, under a twisting hau tree, it had a spacious lanai--a detached porch-- where the life of the mission would be conducted; and it had a front door built in the Dutch fashion so that the bottom half could remain closed, keeping people out, while the top was open, allowing their smiles and their words to enter.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was into this house that Abner moved the furniture he had brought out from New England: a rickety bed with rope netting for its mattress; rusted trunks to serve as closets; a small kitchen table and two chairs and a rocker. Whatever clothes they might require in years to come they would get only through the charity of Christians in New England, who would forward barrels of cast-off garments to the mission center in Honolulu, and if Jerusha needed a new dress to replace her old one, some friend in Honolulu would pick through the leftovers and say, “This one ought to fit Sister Jerusha,” but it never did. If Abner required a new saw with which to build even the minor decencies of living, he had to hope that some Christian somewhere would send him one. If Jerusha needed a cradle for her babies, she could get it only from charity. The Hales had no money, no income, no support other than the communal depository in Honolulu. Even if they were fevered to the point of death they could buy no medicine; they had to trust that Christians would keep replenished their little box of calomel, ipecac and bicarbonate.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometimes Jerusha, recalling either her cool, clean home in Walpole, its closets filled with dresses kept starched by servants, or the two homes that Captain Rafer Hoxworth had promised her in New Bedford and aboard his ship, understandably felt distressed by the grass hut in which she toiled, but she never allowed her feelings to be discovered by her husband and her letters home were uniformly cheerful. When the days were hottest and her work the hardest she would wait until evening and then write to her mother, or to Charity or Mercy, telling them of her alluring adventures, but with them, even though they were of her own family, she dealt only in superficialities; increasingly it would be to Abner’s sister Esther, whom she had never met, that she would pour out the flood of deeper thoughts that swept over her. In one of her earliest letters she wrote:</p>

  <p class="normal">“My most Cherished Sister in God, Dear Esther. I have been strangely mournful these days, for sometimes the heat is unbearable in Lahaina, whose name I find means Merciless Sun, and no appellation could be more appropriate. Possibly these have been unduly difficult weeks, for Malama has pressed me endlessly to teach her, and although she cannot pay attention to lessons for more than an hour at a time, as soon as her interest flags she calls for her servants to massage her, and as they do, commands me to tell her a story, so I tell her of Mary and Esther and Ruth, but when I first spoke of Ruth’s leaving her home to dwell in an alien land, I am afraid that tears fell, and Malama saw this and understood and drove the massaging women away and came to me and rubbed noses with me and said, ‘I appreciate that you have come to live with us in a strange land.’ Now whenever she wants a story she insists like a child that I tell her again of Ruth, and when I come to the part about the strange land, we both weep. She has never once thanked me for anything I have done for her, considering me only an additional servant, but I have grown to love her, and I have never known a woman to learn so fast.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For some curious reason I have been impelled, these last few days, to talk with you, for I feel that of all the people I remember in America, your spirit is closest to my own, and I have wanted to tell you two things, my beloved sister in God. First, I thank you daily for having written to me as you did about your brother Abner. Each day that passes I find him a stronger man, a fine servant of God. He is gentle, patient, courageous and extremely wise. Sharing his burdens, in this new land which he is determined to resurrect, is a joy that I had never in America even dimly anticipated. Each day is a new challenge. Each night is a benediction to good work either started or completed. In my letters to you I have never spoken of love, but I think that now I know what love is, and my dearest wish for you is that some day you may find a Christian gentleman as worthy as your gentle brother. His limp is much improved, but I massage his muscles each night. To be more correct, I used to massage them, but lately a very plump Hawaiian woman who is known to be highly skilled in the lomilomi, the medicinal massage of the islands, insists upon doing the job for me. I can hear her now, a huge motherly woman announcing, ‘Me come lomilomi little man.’ I tell her repeatedly that she must refer to my partner and guide as ‘Makua,’ which means Father, but this she will not do.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The second thought I would share with you is my growing sense of working directly under the will of God. At one time I did not know whether I had a true vocation for mission work or not, but as the weeks go past and as I see the transformation that we are accomplishing in these islands, I am doubly convinced that I have found for myself the one satisfying occupation on earth. I rejoice to see each new dawn, for there is work to do. At five o’clock in the morning, when I look out into our yard, I see it filled with patient, handsome brown faces. They are willing to remain there all day in hopes that I will teach them how to sew or talk with them about the Bible. Malama promises me that when she has learned to read and write, I can start to teach her people to do the same, but she will not allow any of them to master the tricks until she has done so. However, she has consented to this. In her afternoon lessons she allows her children and those of the other alii to listen, and I find that her beautiful daughter Noelani is almost as quick as Malama herself. My dear husband has great hopes for Noelani and feels certain that she will be our second Christian convert on the island, Malama of course being first. Darling Esther, can you, in your mind’s eye, picture the intense wonder that comes over a pagan face when the clouds of heathenish evil and illiteracy are drawn away so that the pure light of God can shine into the seeking eyes? What I am trying to tell you, dearest sister, is that I find in my work a supreme happiness, and although what I am about to say may seem blasphemy—and I can say it to no other but my own dear sister—in these exciting fruitful days when I read the New Testament I feel that I am reading not about Philemon and the Corinthians but about Jerusha and the Hawaiians. I am one with those who labored for our Master, and I cannot convey even to my dear husband the abounding joy I have discovered in my grass shack and its daily circle of brown faces. Your Sister in God, Jerusha.”</p>

  <p class="normal">While Jerusha was teaching Malama, Abner was free to explore the village, and one day he noticed that all the men and many of the stronger women were absent from Lahaina, and he could not discover why. The alii were present, and in their large grass homes south of the royal taro patch they could be seen, moving about beneath the kou trees or going to the beach in order to ride their surfboards on the cresting waves. It was good to be an alii, for then one’s job was merely to eat enormous calabashes of food so as to grow large, and to play at games, so as to be ready if war came.</p>

  <p class="normal">Year by year the alii grew greater and more skilled&#160; in games, waiting for a war that came no more.</p>

  <p class="normal">But one of the alii was missing, for Kelolo had not been to visit the missionaries for some days. He had sent food and three planks out of which Abner had hacked shelving for rude closets, but he himself had not appeared, and this handicapped Abner, because only Kelolo could say where the church was to be built. Then, when the missionary had reached the height of impatience, he discovered that Kelolo was out at the edge of town, digging a deep, wide pit. Kelolo was not present to translate when Abner found the excavation, and all Kelolo would say was, “Thetis,” measuring the deep pit with his arms extended.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was still perplexed when he saw, staggering along the beach, a procession of more than two thousand men and women, the dust from their movements filling the sky. They were goaded along by royal lieutenants, and they were burdened heavily by bundles of logs cut into six-foot lengths and slung from their backs by vines. The yellowish wood was obviously precious, for if even a small piece fell, sharp-eyed lieutenants struck the careless carrier and directed trailing women to salvage the dropping, for this was sandalwood: aromatic as no other, choice in tie markets of Asia, the lifeblood of Hawaiian commerce, and the goal of all Americans. It was the treasure and the curse of Hawaii.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deep in the forests the trees hid, less than thirty feet high and marked by pale green leaves. Years ago, before their worth was known, the trees had flourished even in the lowlands, but now all those of easy access were gone, chopped down by the alii for whom they were kapu. Kelolo, if he wanted the two shiploads that would pay Captain Janders for the Thetis, had to drive his servants high into the mountains and on into remote corners of the island. Now, as the heavily burdened men staggered to the pit, Abner understood. On that first day while he had been instructing Malama, Captain Janders had laid out a pit the exact size of the Thetis’ hatch, and when the pit was filled with sandalwood twice over, the ship would be Kelolo’s.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the precious logs tumbled into the excavation, Kelolo’s men jumped in and laid them close together, for Janders had insisted many times, “No air! No air!” and Abner realized that these men had been in the mountains for some days. He was therefore disturbed when Kelolo ordered them back into the forests immediately. Summoning Kelolo, Abner argued: “Your father shouldn’t take his men back at once. What will happen to the taro beds? Who will catch the fish?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re his men,” Keoki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course they are,” Abner agreed. “But it’s in Kelolo’s own best interests that they be given a rest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When an alii smells sandalwood, the mind turns and thought departs,” Keoki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I must see your father,” Abner insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He won’t want to see you now,” Keoki warned. “His mind is concerned only with sandalwood.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, Abner donned his black claw-hammer, tall hat and best stock, his invariable uniform when delivering the word of the Lord. In the heat of the day he strode southward past the king’s quarters and out to the cool kou trees and the great grass houses of Malama and her consort-brother. He heard his wife Jerusha instructing huge Malama in the writing of letters, American style, but he paid no attention, for he wished to see only Kelolo, and he found him playing in the surf.</p>

  <p class="normal">The chief, seeing Abner’s official uniform, and not wanting a lecture at this time, refused to come out of the water, so Abner had to pick his way gingerly along the sandy shore, shouting above the waves as they washed in. “Kelolo!” he cried like a prophet from the Old Testament. “You have broken every promise to me.” Imitating his instructor’s voice, Keoki repeated the words.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell him to go away!” Kelolo grunted, splashing water into his big face and rolling about in deep pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo! You have not set aside the land for the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, I’ll give you land for the church . . . one of these days,” the sybaritic nobleman shouted back.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Today!”&#160; Abner demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I finish with the sandalwood,” Kelolo promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo, it is not sensible to lead your men back into the forests right away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The big man scratched his back on a coral head and growled, “You’ve got to get sandalwood when you can find it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is wrong to demand so much of your men!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re my men!” the chief insisted. “They’ll go where I tell them to go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is wrong, Kelolo, to hoard sandalwood when the taro patches and the fish ponds remain unattended.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The taro will take care of itself,” Kelolo said grimly, diving deep to be rid of the irritating voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where will he come up?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Over there,” Keoki replied, and the missionary ran along the sand, holding onto his tall hat, so that when the chief surfaced, there was Abner staring at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo, God says we must respect all who work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re my men,” the huge nobleman growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And that platform,” Abner continued. “It’s not been taken down.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t touch the platform!” Kelolo warned, but the missionary was disgusted with the chief’s behavior and ran awkwardly across the sand to the offending platform of old gods and reached down to throw aside the rocks of which it was composed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” warned Keoki, but Abner would not listen, and began tossing the ancient stones into the sea. One rolled near Kelolo, and when he saw his own handiwork thus destroyed, he uttered a wild cry, leaped from the surf and dashed inland, grabbing the lame little missionary by his claw-hammer coat and throwing him violently to one side.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t touch the rocks,” he roared.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, stunned by the suddenness of the attack, rose unsteadily to his feet and studied the naked giant who guarded the platform. Recovering his hat, he placed it firmly on his head and moved resolutely toward the collection of rocks. “Kelolo,” he said solemnly, “this is an evil place. You will not let me build a church but you hold onto your evil old gods. This is wrong.” And with his right index finger extended as far as it would reach, he pointed directly at the chief. “It is hewa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The naked warrior, hero of battles, was inspired to pick up this worrisome little man and crush him, but the solemnity of Abner’s manner stopped him, and the two stood there under the kou trees, staring at each other, and finally Kelolo temporized: “Makua Hale. I promised you land for a church, but I must wait until my king sends word from Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we tear down this evil place?” Abner asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Makua Hale,” Kelolo said firmly. “This my church in the old fashion. I will help you build your church in the new fashion.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly Abner said, “When I stand beside these rocks, Kelolo, I can hear the voices of all the victims who were sacrificed here. It is an evil memory.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was not that kind of temple, Makua Hale,” Kelolo said forcefully. “This was a temple of love and protection. I cannot surrender it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner had the sense to bow to this decision, but he did so in a way that Kelolo never forgot. Lifting one of the stones reverently, the little missionary looked at it and said, “If you consider this a rock from a temple of mercy I can understand why you wish to preserve it. But I shall build a church that will truly be a temple of mercy, and you will see the difference. To your temple, Kelolo, only the strong alii could come. In my temple it will be the weak and the poor who will find mercy. And when you see the mercy that spreads out from my temple, Kelolo, believe me, you will come to this shore and throw every rock in this pile far out to sea.” And Abner strode to the shore in as impressive a manner as his limp would allow, and at the edge of the sea he drew back his arm and pitched the solitary rock far into the waves. Then, holding his hat, he came back to Kelolo and said, “We will build my church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall chieftain kept his promise. Wrapping his tapa about him, he marched through the hot sunlight to a fine piece of land north of the mission grounds, where he paced off a generous area and said, “You can build your church here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is not enough land,” Abner protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Enough for one god,” Kelolo replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your own temples have more land,” Abner argued.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“But they also have more gods,” Kelolo explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My God is bigger than all the gods in Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How much land does he require?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He wants a church of this size,” Abner insisted, and Kelolo was astonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the marking out was completed, he said, “Good. I will call the kahunas to determine how the church should be arranged.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner did not understand Keoki’s translation and asked, “What’s he going to do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Call the kahunas,” Keoki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What for?” Abner asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The kahunas have to decide where the door should be, where the people will sit,” Keoki explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo, sensing Abner’s repugnance, hurried to explain, “You must not build a church without permission from the kahunas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner felt dizzy. Frequently since his arrival on Maui he had been confronted by positive confusion. Malama and Kelolo both eagerly wanted Christianity for their island, and each had given substantial signs of surrendering a good deal to the new religion, but repeatedly they indicated that they considered it not a new religion, not a truth that would shatter old ways and introduce salvation, but merely a better religion than the one they had. Once Kelolo had reasoned, “If Jesus Christ can give you big ships with many sails, and Kane gives us only canoes, Jesus Christ must be much better. He is welcome.” Malama, impressed always with the power of the written word, had corrected her husband. “It is not ships that Jesus Christ brings. It is the mana there in the black box,” she said, indicating the Bible. “When we learn to read what is in the box, we will know the secret of mana, and we too will be strong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jesus does not bring either ships or books,” Abner had patiently explained. “He brings light that illuminates the soul.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll take the light, too,” Kelolo had agreed, for he was tired of his smoky oil-nut candles when the white man’s whale-oil lamps were so obviously superior.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not mean that kind of light,” Abner had started to say, but sometimes the Hawaiians were too much for him. Now, however, he was adamant. “No kahuna, no evil, heathenish priest is going to say how we shall build the church of God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But kahunas . . .” Kelolo began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Abner shouted. “The door will be here. The steeple will be here.” And he placed big stones at the critical orientations. When he was finished, Kelolo studied the intended building for a long time. He looked to the hills and beyond them to the mountains. He studied the pathway of the little stream and the distance to the sea, but mostly he studied the rise and fall of the land, as if it consisted of human hands waiting to receive the building which would soon rest within the palms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally he shook his head sadly and said, “The kahunas won’t like it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The kahunas will never enter it,” Aimer said stiffly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll keep out the kahunas!” Kelolo gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. This is a church for those who obey Jehovah and keep his Commandments.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the kahunas are eager to join,” Kelolo protested. “They all want to find what power it is your god has that enables his people to build boats and make new lights that are better than ours. Oh, you’ll have no better people in your church than the kahunas!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the dizziness—the crazy irrationality of Hawaii—attacked Abner and he explained slowly, “I have come with the Bible to wipe out the kahunas, their gods and their evil ways.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the kahunas love Jesus Christ,” Kelolo cried. “He is so powerful. I love Jesus Christ!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you are not a kahuna,” Abner countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Slowly, Kelolo raised himself to his full austere height. “Makua Hale, I am the Kahuna Nui. My father was the Kahuna Nui, and his father, and his father all the way back to Bora Bora.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was stunned by this intelligence, but he felt that the moment was critical and that he must not surrender his position. “I don’t care if your great-grandfather Bora Bora was a kahuna …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bora Bora is an island,” Kelolo said proudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I never heard of it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Kelolo was astonished. “In Boston they did not teach you about …” He stopped, thought a moment, and then placed his right foot on the stone indicating the door to Abner’s church. “Makua Hale, we are in the time when gods are changing. These are always difficult times. When I argue as a kahuna, I am not defending the old gods of Hawaii. They have already been defeated by your god. We all know that. But I am speaking as the kahuna who knows this land. I have often spoken with the spirits of Lahaina and I understand the hills. Makua Hale, believe me when I tell you that this door is wrong for this land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will build the door here,” Abner said resolutely.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sadly, Kelolo studied the obstinate man who understood so little about churches, but he argued no more. “Now I will lead my men back to the sandalwood trees. When we have returned three times, I will direct them to build your church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three times! Kelolo, the crops will be ruined by then.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are my men,” the huge chief said stubbornly, and that evening he led two thousand of them back into the hills.</p>

  <p class="normal">ON <span>THE THIRTIETH DAY</span> after the arrival of the missionaries at Lahaina, Malama, the Alii Nui, had her handmaidens clothe her in the new China silk dress that Jerusha Hale had sewed for her. She put on shoes for the first time—heavy sailor’s shoes with the laces untied—and covered her wealth of long black hair with a wide-brimmed straw hat from Ceylon. Then she ordered her servants to lay new tapa with extra care, and when this was done she lay prone on the floor, directed the fanning to begin, and spread before her a sheet of white paper, an ink pot and a China quill.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now I shall write!” she announced, and in a clean, disciplined hand</p>

  <p class="normal">she composed this letter in Hawaiian for her nephew in Honolulu:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Liholiho King. My husband Kelolo is working hard. He is going to buy a ship. Aloha, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When this exacting task was completed, the huge woman heaved a sigh and pushed the letter toward Jerusha and Abner. Then women came in to lomilomi her, and she smiled proudly from the floor as Jerusha said, “I have never known a person to learn so fast as Malama.” When Keoki translated this, his mother stopped smiling and brushed away the lomilomi women, saying, “Before long I shall write to the king of America … in your language . . . and I shall use all twenty-six letters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’ll do it!” Jerusha said proudly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, little daughter,” Malama said, “you have taught me well. You must go home and rest. It is Makua Hale who shall teach me now.” Dismissing Jerusha she rolled over on her belly again, propped her chin in her hands, stared at him intensely and commanded, “Tell me about your god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner had long anticipated this holy moment, and he had constructed a patient, step-by-step explanation of his religion, and as he began to speak with Keoki’s help, he sensed that the huge woman on the floor was passionately eager to know all that he knew, so he worked with special care, choosing each word exactly and consulting often with Keoki as to its translation into Hawaiian, for he knew that if he could win Malama to the side of God, he would automatically win all of Maui.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God is a spirit,” he said carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can I ever see him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She pondered this for some moments and said, “Well, I could never see Kane, either.” Then she added suspiciously, “But Kelolo has often seen his goddess, Pele of the volcanoes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner had sworn to himself that he would not be led down by-paths. He was not here to argue against Kelolo’s miserable assortment of superstitions. He was here to expound the true faith, and he knew from experience that once he started on Kelolo’s gods he was apt to get tangled up in irrelevant arguments.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God is a spirit, Malama,” he repeated, “but He created everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did he create heaven?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner had never confronted this problem, but he replied unhesitatingly, “Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is heaven?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was going to say that it is in the mind of God, but he took the easier course and replied, “Up there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you certain in your heart, Makua Hale, that your god is more powerful than Kane?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot compare the two, Malama. And I cannot explain God to you if you insist upon comparing them. And don’t call Him my God. He is absolute.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This made sense to Malama, for she had witnessed the white man’s superior power and knew instinctively that his god must also be superior, and she was gratified to hear Abner proclaim the fact. On this principle she was ready to accept his teaching completely, “God is all-powerful,” she said quietly. “Then why did he bring the sailor’s pox to infect our girls? Why does he make so many Hawaiians die these days?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sin is permitted by God, even though He is all-powerful, for it is sin that tests men and proves them in God’s eyes.” He paused, and Malama indicated to one of her many servants that they must keep the flies off the missionary, too, and soft feathers swept his neck and forehead. Although he appreciated the attention, he felt that Malama’s instructions had been an interruption consciously commanded by the woman to provide time for her thinking, so he added gravely, looking directly at the chieftain, “If you continue in sin, you cannot know God.” Pausing dramatically and bringing his face close to hers, he said with great force, preparing the way for the great decision that would later become inevitable, “Malama, to prove that you know God you must put away sin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it possible that the Alii Nui herself is sinful?” Malama asked, for her religion took care of this problem by postulating that the acts of the alii were the acts of gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">But she was to discover that in Abner Hale’s new religion the answer was strikingly different. Pointing his forefinger at the prone woman he said firmly, “All men on earth are totally depraved. We abide in sin. Our natures are permeated and corrupted in all parts of our being.” He paused, then fell to his knees so that he would be closer to the Alii Nui, and added, “And because kings have greater power, their sin is greater. The Alii Nui is the most powerful woman in Maui. Therefore her sin is greater. Malama,” he cried in the woeful, desperate voice of John Calvin, “we are all lost in sin!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A child cried in one of the surrounding huts, and Malama asked, “Is that baby filled with sin, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“From the moment that child was born . . . No, Malama, from the moment it was conceived, it was steeped in sin. It was drowned in mortal vice, horrible, perpetual, inescapable. That child is totally corrupt.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama pondered this and asked tentatively, “But if your god is all-powerful . . .” Then she stopped, for she was willing to accept Abner’s earlier answer. She thought aloud: “God has arranged sin to test us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner smiled for the first time. “Yes. You understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what will happen, Makua Hale, to that baby if it is not rescued from sin?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will be plunged into fire everlasting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What will happen to me, Makua Hale, if I am not saved from sin?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will be plunged into fire everlasting.” There was a pause in the grass house as Malama shifted her weight on the tapas. Rolling over on her right side, she leaned her jawbone on her right hand and motioned Abner to sit on the tapa near her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is the fire like?” she asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It leaps about your feet. It tears at your eyeballs. It fills your nose. It burns incessantly, but you are constantly re-created so that it can burn you again. Its pain is horrible beyond imagining. Its . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama interrupted, asking weakly, “Once I traveled with Kamehameha to the edge of a burning lava flow, and I stood with him when he sacrificed his hair to appease Pele. Are the fires worse than that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama, they are much worse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And all the good Hawaiians who died before you came here, Makua Hale? Are they living in that perpetual fire?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They died in sin, Malama. They now live in that fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The huge woman gasped, took away her right elbow and allowed her head to fall onto the tapa. After a moment she asked, “My good uncle, Keawe-mauhili? Is he in the fire?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Malama, he is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forever?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And my husband Kamehameha?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is in the fire forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And that baby, if it dies tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will live in the fire forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And my husband Kelolo, who swears he will never accept your religion?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will live in the fire forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And I will never see him again?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The remorselessness of this doctrine overcame Malama, and for the first time she sensed the truly awful power of the new god, and why those who followed him were victorious in war and could invent cannon that swept away tribal villages. She fell to sobbing, “Auwe. Auwe!” and thought of her good uncle and her great king wasting in fires eternal, and her servants brought cool clothes to ease her, but she brushed them away and continued weeping and beating her huge breasts. Finally she asked, “Can those of us who are still alive be saved?”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the question that had once given Abner most trouble: “Can all be saved?” and it stunned him to hear it coming so precisely from the mouth of a heathen, for it was the touchstone of his religion, and he replied, “No, Malama, there are many whom God has predestined for eternal hellfire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean they are condemned even before they are born?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And there is no hope for them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are predestined to live in evil and to die into hellfire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, oh!” Malama wept. “Do you mean that that little baby …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps.”&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even me, the Alii Nui?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This awful concept struck Malama with great force. It seemed a lottery of life and death … a god throwing smoothed pebbles into a rock hole . . . and sometimes missing. But it was the god who missed, and not the pebble, for unless the god had wanted to, he need not have missed. With pebbles he was all-powerful.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Abner was speaking: “I must confess, Malama, that all who slide into evil do so by the divine will of God and that some men are destined from birth to certain fire, that His name may be glorified in heaven because of their destruction. It is a terrible decree, I do confess, but none can deny that God foresaw all things for all men before He created them. We live under His divine ordinance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can I be saved?” Malama asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Abner’s face became radiant, and his infusion of spirit transferred itself to the weeping woman, and she began to feel in the grass house a consolation that would never depart. “When God foredoomed all men,” Abner said forcefully, “His great compassion directed Him to send to us His only begotten son, and it is Jesus Christ who can save us, Malama. Jesus Christ can enter this house and lift you by the hand and lead you to cool water. Jesus Christ can save us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will Jesus save me?” Malama asked hopefully. “He will!” Abner cried joyously, clasping her huge hands in his, “Malama, Jesus Christ will enter this room and save you.” “What must I do to be saved?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are two things required, Malama. The first is easy. The second is difficult.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is the easy one?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You must go down on your knees before the Lord and acknowledge that you are totally corrupt, that you live in sin, and that there is no hope for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I must confess those things?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Unless you do, you can never be saved.” Now the little missionary became once more the stern teacher, for he withdrew his hands, moved away from the prone chieftain and pointed at her: “And you must not only say the words. You must believe them. You ate corrupt, Malama. Evil, evil, evil.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And what is the second task?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You must work to attain a state of grace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know what grace is, Makua Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When you have honestly confessed your corruption, and when you plead for God’s light, some day it will come to you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How will I recognize it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when I have found this . . . What is the word, Keoki?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her son explained again and she asked him, “Did you find grace?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“On the stone pavement in front of Yale College.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And was it a light, as Makua Hale says.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was like the heavens opening up,” Keoki assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will I find grace?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one can say for sure, Mother, but I think you will, for you are a good woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama pondered this for some time, and then asked Abner, “What things have I been doing that are sinful?”</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment Abner was tempted to believe that this was the instant when he must excoriate the evil ways of the Alii Nui, but a more sober judgment prevailed and he restrained himself, saying, “Malama, you learned how to write in only thirty days. It was a miracle. Therefore I think you can perform the greater miracle that awaits.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama, loving praise and steeped in it since her first days as the Alii Nui, firmed her jaw and asked, “What is required?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you take a walk with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Through your land . . . through the land you rule.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama, exhilarated by her success in learning, agreed, and summoned her land canoe; but with all the able men in the mountains seeking sandalwood, there were none to man the carrying poles, and Abner raised his first disturbing question: “Why do you allow your workingmen to toil like slaves in the hills?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re after sandalwood,” Malama explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For what?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For Kelolo’s ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is the ruin of a beautiful island worth a ship?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, Makua Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want you to walk with me, Malama, and see the fearful price Lahaina is paying for the sandalwood that Kelolo is seeking in the mountains.” So Malama summoned her maids-in-waiting, and a procession was formed that would, in time, modify the history of Hawaii. The little missionary limped in front, accompanied by towering Keoki. Behind them marched gigantic Malama in a blue and red dress. On her right walked the handmaiden Kalani-kapuai-kala-ninui, five feet tall and two hundred and fifteen pounds, while on the left puffed Manono-kaua-kapu-kulani, five feet six inches and two hundred and eighty pounds. Side by side, the three alii women filled the road as Abner began his perambulatory sermon.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A ship at this time, Malama, is merely a vanity. Look at the walls of the fish pond. Crumbling.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it matter?” Malama asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If the fish escape, the people will starve,” Abner said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When the men come back . . . from the sandalwood . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The fish will be gone,” Abner reported dolefully. “Malama, you and I will rebuild the fish pond.” And he stepped into the mud, calling her after him. Quickly, she perceived what he was teaching and ordered her handmaidens to help, and the three huge women plunged into the fish pond, pulling the back hems of their new dresses forward and up between their legs like giant diapers. Giggling and telling obscene jokes which Abner could not understand—among themselves they called him “the little white cockroach”—the alii mended the breaks, and when they were finished, Abner hammered home his lesson: “The wise Alii Nui commands the fish ponds to be patrolled.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A little farther on he pointed to a grass house that had burned to the ground. “Four people died there, Malama. A wise Alii Nui would outlaw the use of tobacco.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the people like to smoke,” Malama protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And so you let them burn to death. Since I came to Lahaina, six of your people have burned to death. A wise Alii Nui . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where are you taking me?” Malama interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To a spot a little farther under the kou trees,” Abner explained, and before long he had Malama and the women standing beside a small oblong of freshly dug earth, and she recognized it immediately for what it was. She preferred not to speak of this little plot of earth, but Abner said, “Beneath here lies a baby girl, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” the Alii Nui said gently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The child was placed here by her own mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Alive.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand, Makua Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And while the child was still alive, the mother covered it with earth and stamped upon the earth until the little girl . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please, Makua Hale. Please.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A wise Alii Nui, one who sought grace, would order this evil to be stopped.” Malama said nothing, and the procession marched on until it reached the spot where three sailors were buying whiskey from an Englishman, and on the arms of the sailors were the four pretty girls whose father had paddled them to the Thetis on its arrival. “These are the girls who will soon die of sailor’s pox,” Abner said mournfully. “A wise Alii Nui would outlaw whiskey and keep the girls from going to the ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They passed the taro patches, rank with weeds, and the little pier with bales of goods from China waiting in the sun and rain. No men were in the fishing boats. When the circuit was at last completed, the little missionary pointed at the platform of stones in Malama’s own front yard and said, “Even at your door you harbor the evil old gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s Kelolo’s temple,” Malama said. “It does no harm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the mention of the absent chief, Abner knew that the ultimate moment had come, the one toward which he had been building. He asked Malama to dismiss her attendants, and when they were gone he led the huge chieftain and Keoki to a smooth spot under the kou trees, and when all were comfortably seated he said forcefully, “I have taken you on this walk, Malama, to show you that God appoints a woman His Alii Nui for a reason. He gives you great power so that you may produce great good. More is expected of you than of ordinary people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This made much sense to Malama, for the tenets of her old religion were not markedly different . . . only the interpretation. If a man was an alii, he was expected to die in battle. A woman alii must appear noble and eat enormously so that she seemed bigger than she was. In all religions there were duties, but she was not prepared for the one which the little missionary was about to propose.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will never enter a state of grace, Malama,” Abner said slowly, “so long as you commit one of the gravest sins in human history.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is that?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner hesitated, and the concept he now had to discuss was so loathsome to him that he rose, drew back a few steps and pointed at the Alii Nui: “You have as your husband your own brother. You must send Kelolo away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama was appalled at the suggestion. “Kelolo . . . why he . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He must go, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he is my favorite husband,” she protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This relationship is evil … it is forbidden by the Bible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this news a benign light of comprehension shone over Malama’s face. “You mean it is kapu!” she asked brightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is not kapu,” Abner insisted. “It is forbidden by God’s law.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what kapu means,” Malama explained patiently. “Now I understand. All gods have kapu. You mustn’t eat this fish, it is kapu. You mustn’t sleep with a woman who is having her period, it is kapu. You mustn’t . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama!” Abner thundered. “Being married to your brother is not kapu! It’s not some idle superstition. It’s a law of God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know. I know. Not a little kapu like certain fish, but big kapu, like not entering a temple if you are unclean. All gods have big and little kapus. So Kelolo is a big kapu and he must go. I understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You don’t understand,” Abner began, but Malama was so pleased with her comprehension of this aspect, at least, of the new god, that she was spurred to action, and she summoned her servants in a loud voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo will not live in this house any more! He will live in that house!” And she indicated one of the compound quarters about twenty feet removed from his previous residence. The law promulgated, she beamed at Abner.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That is not enough, Malama. He must move out of the compound altogether.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this, Malama said something to Keoki which the young man was too embarrassed to translate, but Abner insisted, and Keoki, blushing, explained, “My mother says that she stopped sleeping with her four other husbands years ago and you need have no fear that she will misbehave . . .” Keoki stopped, for he did not have the words. “Anyway, she says that Kelolo is a kind man and she hopes he can stay within the compound.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Angrily, Abner stamped his foot and shouted, “No! This is an evil thing. Tell her it is the biggest kapu of all … Wait, don’t use that word! Tell her merely that the Lord says specifically that Kelolo must move outside the compound.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama began to cry and said that Kelolo was more to her than either a husband or a brother and that . . . Abner interrupted and said simply, “Unless he moves, Malama, you will never be able to join the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She did not understand this and asked, “I will not be allowed inside the big new church Kelolo is going to build?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You may come inside,” Abner said gently. “Even the worst sinner may come and listen. And you may sing, too. But you may never join the church . . . the way Keoki has joined.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama considered this for a long time, concluding brightly, “Very well. I’ll sing and keep Kelolo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when you die,” Abner said, “you will burn in hell forever and ever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama knew she was being maneuvered into a corner, so with tears in her big deep eyes she said to Keoki, using sly words that Abner would not be able to detect, “I do not want to burn in hell, so you must build Kelolo a small house outside the compound, but brush the path well so there are no leaves, and at night he can tiptoe back to my room and God will not hear him.” Then, in a loud voice she announced: “Makua Hale, I am going to write a new letter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When she was sprawled once more on the floor of her palace, she tore up the earlier message, bit her pen and wrote:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Liholiho King. I have told Kelolo he must now sleep outside. He is buying a ship. I think it is a foolish thing to do. Your aunt, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She handed Abner the letter, and when he had read it she said, “Tomorrow and tomorrow and the day after that I want you to come here to talk with me about the duty of an alii nui. After one moon I shall find a state of grace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It cannot be done in that way, Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When can I find it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps never.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will find it!” the great woman roared. “You will come here tomorrow and teach me how to find it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot do that, Malama,” Abner said resolutely.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You . . . will … do … it!” she threatened.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No man can find grace for another,” Abner stubbornly insisted,</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama leaped to her feet with strange agility and grabbed her little -mentor by the shoulders. “How shall I find grace?” she demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you really want to know, Malama?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” she replied, shaking him as if he were a child. “Tell me!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kneel down,” he commanded, and he did so himself, showing her how to pray.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do I do now?” she whispered, turning her big eyes at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Close your eyes. Make a temple of your hands and say, ‘Jesus Christ, my master, teach me to be humble and to love Thee.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is humble?” Malama asked, her voice lower.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Humble means that even the greatest alii nui in Maui is no more than a man who catches mullet from the fish pond,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean that even the slave . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama,” Abner said in ashen voice, overcome by his own perception of God’s law, “it seems to me that right now the lowliest slave hauling sandalwood from the forest has a better chance of Ending grace than you do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” the kneeling woman begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because at any moment he may find God, for he has a humble spirit. But you are proud, and argumentative, and unwilling to humble yourself before the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are proud, too, Makua Hale,” the huge woman argued. “Do you humble yourself before the Lord?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If He told me tomorrow to march into the waves until they overcame me, I would do so. I live for the Lord. I serve the Lord. The Lord is my light and my salvation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand,” the Alii Nui said. “I will pray for humbleness.” And when he left, she was still kneeling with her hands forming the steeple of a church.</p>

  <a id="section_2"></a>

  <p class="normal">For the next several days Abner did not see Malama, for serious riots were sweeping Lahaina, and with Kelolo and the men gone, only Abner was left to combat them. Trouble started when three whaling ships, in from the Off-Japan grounds, sent more than eighty men ashore on overdue leave. The first place they visited was Murphy’s grog shop, and from there they branched out through Lahaina, fighting, debauching, and at last murdering. Emboldened by the lack of police to discipline them, they formed mobs and began sacking Hawaiian homes, searching for girls, and when they found any, they dragged them to the ships, not waiting to discover whether these were normal ships’ girls or not, and in this way many faithful wives of men off on the sandalwood expedition were raped.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last, Abner Hale put on his black claw-hammer, his best stock and his tall beaver hat, and went down to the pier. “Row me out to the whalers!” he commanded the useless old men who were lounging along the shore, and when he reached the first ship he found that the captain was gone, and at the second the captain was locked in his room with a girl and would not speak with the missionary, cursing him through the door, but at the third ship Abner found a captain who sat below drinking whiskey, and to him Abner said, “Your men are debauching Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s what I brought ‘em here fer,” the captain said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They’re raping our women, Captain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They always do, in Lahaina. The women like it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Last night there was murder,” Abner continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You catch the murderer and well hang him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he could be one of your men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Probably was. Eight of my men deserve hangin’. I’d love to see ‘em all swingin’ from an arm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain, have you no sense of responsibility for what is going on ashore?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, Reverend,” the captain said wearily, “for the last two nights I been ashore meself. Only reason I’m not there now is I’m too damned old … for three nights in a row, that is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a great cry from ashore, and one of the grass houses went up in flames. From the captain’s quarters Abner could see the blaze and it seemed near his home, and he was panicked for fear that</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha might be in danger. Pointing his finger at the captain he threatened: “Captain Jackson, of the Bugle&#160; out of Salem, I shall write to your church, Captain, and advise your minister of how one of his members conducts himself in Lahaina.’</p>

  <p class="normal">“By God!” the captain roared, pushing away his grog. “If you mention my name in your letters . . .” He lunged at Abner, but was drunk and missed him, his huge bulk crashing into the wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You cannot be two men, Captain,” Abner said solemnly. “A beast in Lahaina and a saint in Salem. You must stop the rioting.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll strangle your dirty little chicken neck!” Captain Jackson shouted, clutching for the missionary, who had no trouble evading him. “You get off this ship! Lahaina was a good port till you came along.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Ashore another house went up in flames, and as Abner reached the deck he could see four sailors chasing a girl who had thus been routed out for their sport. “May God forgive them,” Abner prayed. “But with such leaders . . .” He swung himself down into his canoe and returned to shore, determined at least to protect Jerusha, lest the violence disturb her pregnancy, but before he could get to her, there was a new commotion, and now even the stragglers along the shore became excited, for three large sailors had been prowling about the back area of Malama’s compound and had discovered her young daughter Noelani, and were now dragging her through the dusty streets until they could find a comfortable spot in which to rape her, and she was screaming in Hawaiian, while the sailors cursed in English.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few old men, too weak to be with the sandalwooders, proved themselves loyal to their alii and tried to stop the rapists, but they were laughingly pushed aside, for in justice to the sailors they could not distinguish between an ordinary girl, with whom such conduct was customary, and an alii, with whom it was sacrilege. Other old men tried to intervene, but they also were bowled over with shocking jolts to the jaw, and the drunken sailors proceeded with their captive.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Abner Hale limped up, holding onto his top hat, and he pointed his right hand in the faces of the sailors and cried, “Set loose that girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Get out of the way, little man!” the sailors warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am a minister of God!” Abner warned them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first two sailors stopped at this, but the third swaggered up to the missionary and shouted, “In Lahaina there is no God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, who weighed only half of what the sailor did, impulsively slapped the man in the face. “God is watching you!” he said solemnly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The slapped man quickly squared off, British fashion, to demolish Abner, whereupon the two other sailors released the girl and grabbed their partner, but when they saw fair Noelani run away, the most beautiful girl they had so far found, they became infuriated and started to strike and punch and kick at Abner. He was saved by Malama herself, for the great alii had seen the abduction of her daughter and had hurried up with what men and women she could command.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the queen!” one of the sailors shouted, and as big Malama waded into the midst of the riot, the men withdrew from beating Abner and ran, cursing, to assemble their mates. Soon more than forty sailors, most of them drunk, crowded the dusty street and shouted imprecations at the missionary and the women who were protecting him. “Come over here, you coward!” they challenged, but whenever an especially bold one spoke, Malama went bravely to him and damned him in Hawaiian, so that after a while the sailors dispersed, and Abner saw with horror that from the shadows two ship’s captains had watched the affair with approval.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What kind of men are they?” he wondered, and when the mob had gone back to Murphy’s grog shop and Malama was attending his bruises, he said quietly, in broken Hawaiian, “Do you see what happens when the men are away gathering sandalwood?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I see,” Malama said. “I will send the women to the hills.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night was one of terror, for the sailors, goaded by their captains, could find no girls, so they surrounded Abner’s home and cursed him vilely till midnight. Then they burned another house and finally found three girls, whom they hauled off to the ship. At two in the morning, when the rioting was its worst, Abner said to Jerusha, “I will leave Keoki and the women here with you. I am going to speak with Pupali.” And by a back route he scurried to the home of Pupali, the ardent canoeist whose occupation it was to paddle his own wife and four daughters to incoming whalers.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat on the floor with Pupali, no light showing, and asked in broken Hawaiian, “Why do you take your own daughters to these evil men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I get cloth and sometimes even tobacco,” Pupali explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you see that some day your daughters may die from the sailors’ disease?” Abner pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some day everybody dies,” Pupali rationalized.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But is a little money worth this to you?” Abner argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Men like girls,” Pupali said truthfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you feel no shame in selling your own wife to the sailors?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Her sister takes care of me,” Pupali said contentedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you proud when the sailors burn down the houses?” Abner pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They never burn my house,” Pupali replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How old is your prettiest daughter, Pupali?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner could hear him suck in his breath in pride. “Iliki? She was born in the year of Keopuolani’s illness.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fourteen, and probably already sick to death!” *1</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you expect? She’s a woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the spur of the moment Abner said, “I want you to give her to me, Pupali.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At last something was happening that the rough old man could understand. Smiling lasciviously he whispered, “You’ll enjoy Iliki. All the men do. How much you give me for her?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am taking her for God,” Abner corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know, but how much you give me?” Pupali pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will clothe her and feed her and treat her as my daughter,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean, you don’t want . . .” Pupali shook his head. “Well, Makua Hale, you must be a good man.” And when morning dawned, Abner, in the dust of riots, started his school for Hawaiian girls. His first pupil was Pupali’s most beautiful daughter, Iliki, and when she appeared she wore only a thin slip about her hips and a silver chain around her neck, from which dangled a whale’s tooth handsomely carved with these words:</p>

  <p class="normal">Observe the truth; enough for man to know Virtue alone is happiness below.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the other island families saw what an advantage Pupali enjoyed by having his daughter as an observer within the missionary household, for she could report on the strangest occurrences, they offered their girls, too, which nullified Pupali’s superiority, so that he countered by enrolling his other three daughters, and when the next whaling ship touched port, matters were different. Before, sailors had instructed the Lahaina girls in profanity in the steaming fo’c’s’ls; now Jerusha taught them cooking and the Psalms in the mission garden, and her ablest pupil was Iliki, Ee-Lee-Kee, the Pelting Spray of Ocean.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ABNER WAS NOT PRESENT</span> to congratulate Iliki on the August afternoon when she first wrote her name and carried it proudly to her father, for that morning had brought an exhausted messenger to Lahaina. He had run across the mountains from the other side of the island, blurting out so bizarre a story that Abner summoned Keoki to translate formally, and the young man said, “It is true! Abraham and Urania Hewlett have marched all the way from Hana, at the opposite end of Maui.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why didn’t they take a canoe?” Abner asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki rapidly interrogated the gasping messenger and then looked blank as the man explained. “It’s hard to believe,” Keoki muttered. “Abraham and Urania set out yesterday morning at four o’clock in a double canoe, but at six o’clock the waves were so great that the canoe broke apart, so Abraham brought his wife ashore through the surf. Then they walked forty miles to Wailuku, where they are now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought that trail was impossible for women,” Abner argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is. The worst on Maui. But Urania had to make it, because next month she is due to have her baby and they wanted to be with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can I …” Abner began in bewilderment.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are afraid she is dying,” the messenger said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If she’s dying . . .” Abner was sweating and nervous. “Well, how did she get to Wailuku?”</p>

  <p class="normal">With gestures, the messenger explained, “The paddlers from the wrecked canoe tied vines under her arms and pulled her up the gullies. Then, when it came time to go down the other side, they grabbed the vines . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Before the tired messenger could finish, Abner knelt in the dust and raised his hands. He could visualize Urania, a dull woman and frightened, undergoing this tremendous trip, and he prayed, “Dear Heavenly Father, save Thy servant, Sister Urania. In her hours of fear, save her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The messenger interrupted and said, “Abraham Hewlett says you must bring your book and help him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The book?” Abner cried. “I thought. . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They need you now,” the messenger insisted. “Because when I left she seemed about to have the baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea of assisting at a birth appalled Abner, but he hurried out to the garden where Jerusha was teaching her girls, and from his frightened look she knew that some new island crisis had occurred, but she was not prepared when he said, “Sister Urania was trying to reach us for help, but she has had to stop in Wailuku.” The Hales had never spoken of Urania’s pregnancy, just as, for reasons of delicacy, they had never mentioned Jerusha’s, trusting that by some miracle the baby would either be born without trouble or wait until Dr. Whipple happened along. Now, under the coconut trees, they had to acknowledge imminent facts.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will take Deland’s Midwifery and do what I can,” Abner said dully, but what he wanted to cry was: “I will be with you, Jerusha! By the will of God, I will see that your baby is well born.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And she replied, “You must help Sister Urania,” but what she intended was: “I am afraid, and I wish my mother were here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So the two young missionaries, each so desperately in love but lacking capacity to speak of it to the other, because they judged that Congregationalism would not approve, looked at each other in the noonday sunlight, and then looked away; but it was Abner who broke, for when they had gone inside to pack Deland it was he who could not control his hands, and the package fell awry and the crucial book fell onto the dusty floor, and when he kneeled to recover he hid his face in his hands and sobbed, “Sister Urania, may God spare you!” But it was another name he longed to say.</p>

  <p class="normal">The journey on foot from Lahaina to Wailuku, on the other side of Maui, took Abner and the messenger high into the mountains, and as they hiked over barren and rocky fields, with sweat pouring from them, they came upon a cloud of dust, and it was Kelolo and his lieutenants, driving their men down to the plains with a vast cargo of sandalwood. For an instant Abner was infuriated and admonished the chief: “While you cut sandalwood, your town diminishes.” But before he heard Kelolo’s justification—”These are my men. I do with them as I please.”—he saw that many of the servants were carrying not sawed trunks from grown trees but saplings and roots grubbed out of the soil.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you take even the new trees?” Abner asked in disgust.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is my sandalwood,” Kelolo explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You faithless servant,” Abner cried and limped on.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they reached the topmost ridge and could see the houses of Wailuku below, Abner paused to wipe away his sweat and thought: “If it is such hard work for us to climb this little hill, how could Urania have borne her journey?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the village of Wailuku they found out. When the canoe in which they were journeying broke up, Abraham had pushed and hauled his wife more than forty miles overland in an effort to join with the Hales at Lahaina, and this had precipitated her labor pains. Now they were bogged down in a trader’s shack, helpless in panic.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a miracle that Urania, after such a trip, was still alive, but it was a greater miracle that Abraham had not thought to enlist the aid of Hawaiian midwives at his home mission, for they were some of the most highly skilled in the Pacific and within ten minutes would have diagnosed Urania’s case as one of simple premature birth brought on by exhaustion. Had the Hewletts relied on them, they would have produced a clean birth and a healthy baby; but for the Hewletts to have accepted their aid would have meant admitting that a heathen, brown-skinned Hawaiian knew how to deliver a Christian white baby, and such an idea was unthinkable.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was sorely tempted to call in the local midwives,” Brother Abraham confessed to Abner, when he ran up to meet the limping traveler, “but I was ever mindful of Jeremiah 10, verse 2: “Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen.’ So I have brought my wife to her own people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner agreed that he had acted wisely, and for a moment the two young men congratulated themselves on their righteousness, but then Abner asked, “How is Sister Urania?”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this question poor Brother Abraham was seized with a blush of respectability which made it almost impossible for him to say the words, but finally he blurted out: “She seems to have lost a great deal of her water.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the growing dusk Abner looked sickly at his companion, then started feverishly unpacking his handbook. Thumbing it awkwardly he found a section titled “The Dry Delivery,” and as he read it hurriedly, he became quite ill in the stomach, for the news was ominous, but when he looked up and saw how hopeless Brother Abraham was, he gritted his teeth and said boldly, “I should like to see Sister Urania.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewlett led him toward a low grass hut in which the Englishman who traded at Wailuku lived, but both the man and his wife were absent in Honolulu, and the house was surrounded by fifty or sixty natives, sitting on the ground and watching the amazing white men. Abner made his way through them, and with his medical book under his arm, went into the mean house to greet the frail woman with whom he had shared the tiny stateroom on the Thetis. “Good evening, Sister Urania,” he said solemnly, and she replied bravely, “It is so consoling to meet again one with whom we journeyed on the small ship.” And for a moment they spoke of happier days.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Abner asked, “Sister Urania, when did your . . .” He paused in acute embarrassment, and then finished with a rush: “Your labor pains, how long have they been occurring?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They started at six this morning,” Urania said. Abner stared at her blankly, but his mind thought fiercely: “Oh, God! That was when she was climbing the last gullies!”</p>

  <p class="normal">He mopped his forehead and said slowly, “That was twelve hours ago. Presumably then, Sister Urania, the child will be born at midnight.” He consulted his watch: six hours to go.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aching with embarrassment, he asked, “Your pains. Have they been frequent?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t think so,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Excuse me,” he said, and fumbled for his book of instructions, but the light was so bad that he could not read, and he directed Brother Abraham to fetch a kukuinut lamp, and by its flickering, wavering light he picked out the words that would guide him. “Have we a sheet of tapa?” he asked, and when one was found, he cut it into halves, twisted them to make ropes, knotted one end and tied the other to the foot of the bed. “You must pull on these knots, Sister Urania,” he instructed her. “In a dry delivery you will be called upon for extra work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Instantly he was sorry he had said these words, for Urania looked up in terror and asked, “Have I done something wrong?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Sister Urania,” he assured her. “With God’s help we shall do well.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Instinctively, she took his hand and whispered, “My cherished husband and I are so glad that you came.” But when Abner, blushing like a child, wanted to examine her stomach, as the handbook directed, both he and the Hewletts thought it proper that she first cover herself with all of her personal clothing plus a stout sheet of tapa. Feeling through the several layers, Abner gravely announced: “There seems nothing awry.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But his head was snapped back by a sudden scream from the bed and an automatic tightening of the ropes. He hurried to the sputtering lamp and studied his watch. In tour minutes another cry and another straining. Sweating, he leafed through his book and found reassuring news. Hurrying back to the bed, he announced happily: “Sister Urania, things are going well. Now time will work with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this news Brother Abraham grew a ghastly white and it was obvious that he was going to be very sick, so Abner left the straining woman and ran to the door of the delivery room, crying in Hawaiian, “Somebody come in here and take care of Reverend Hewlett!” Two experienced midwives, who understood husbands, laughed hilariously and rescued the missionary, who was, as they had predicted in obscene asides to the gathering, conspicuously nauseated, but while the midwives comforted him other Hawaiians whispered, “Isn’t this a strange way to do things? Our best midwives outside the hut caring for the husband, while a man who knows nothing is inside, caring for the mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the way they do it in America,” a listener explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly the midwives dropped Hewlett and listened acutely to Urania’s cries, and it was sardonic that through the night these women, merely by listening, knew better what was occurring inside the hut than Abner, who was there with his book.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hewlett, stabilized after his sickness, wiped his watery blue eyes and made his way back into the hut, demanding, “When will the child be born?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Hewlett!” Abner cried in exasperation. “Unless you can make yourself to be of service, you will have to remain outside.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When will the child be born?” the distraught man begged. Once more Abner went to the door and called for the midwives, who recovered Abraham and made him stay with them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The pains now came at constant intervals, and Abner, checking his book constantly, found occasion to say, “Sister Urania, it does seem as if God were supervising us tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am now in your hands, Brother Abner,” the weak woman replied. “You must do with me as you require.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, Abner recalled that she had said these words with marked lassitude, and shortly thereafter he looked at her with horror and realized that she had not experienced a pain for some time and that she was still. Panic captured him, and he felt her wrists, but they seemed cold, and he ran to the door, shouting, “Brother Abraham! Come quickly!” And when the husband stumbled into the room, Abner reported, in a ghostly voice, “I fear she is dying.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abraham Hewlett uttered a low sob and knelt at the bed, holding his wife’s hand, and this unexpected movement caused Urania to shift her shoulders, and Abner in amazement cried, “Can she be sleeping?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Outside, the midwives, listening intently, had already told the crowd, “She’s sleeping. She’ll probably stay that way for an hour or more. Then when she wakens, she’ll begin all over again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it a good sign when a woman already in labor sleeps?” the crowd asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” said the midwives.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” a man asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It means she’s weak,” the woman said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What should they do … in there?” the man asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They ought to be gathering herbs,” the midwives explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why herbs?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To stop the bleeding, later on … since she is a weak woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Inside the shadowy house Abner and Abraham went frantically through their handbooks and could find nothing about sleeping at the eighteenth hour of delivery, and Abner began to experience an overpowering trembling and fear. “Somewhere in here there must be an explanation,” he muttered, but his awkward fingers could not find it. “Brother Abraham, do you find anything?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, mysteriously, the labor pains started again, rhythmically and in full force, but they gave Abner little help, for it was not Urania who was experiencing them, but her husband Abraham. It was pathetic to see the undernourished missionary grip at his stomach, following the exact course of a woman’s pain, and for the third time Abner had to run to the door and beg the Hawaiians to take his assistant away. “And keep him away!” Abner snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">At two o’clock in the morning Urania Hewlett wakened and at five she had diminished her cycle of pain to intervals of a minute and half, whereupon the listening women outside predicted, “The birth will be soon.” Abner, still fumbling with his book, his eyes bleary, came to the same conclusion, but his next half hour was one of special trial, for not knowing that Urania was undergoing typical labor, he had leafed through the diagrams in the back of the book where unusual births were explained, with black-lettered titles, and he was possessed by one diagram: “Abnormal Birth: Shoulder and Arm Presentation.” Turning rapidly to the associated text, he discovered how difficult his immediate task was going to be if he was, indeed, raced by such a presentation. It was therefore absolutely essential that he prepare for the actual birth, if only to anticipate an abnormality; but this he could not do, because Urania still lay swathed in bedclothes and tapa, and he could not in propriety either remove them himself or ask her to do so. So he went to the door, where streaks of morning light were beginning to penetrate the palm trees, and asked for Brother Abraham, who was sleeping. One of the mid-wives started toward the door, but Abner recoiled from her in honest horror, so Abraham was wakened and Abner said to him, “Brother Abraham, you must now undress your wife. The hour is at hand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abraham looked dumbly at his associate and started toward the bed, but his own labor pains returned with violence, and he had to flee the delivery room, but Abner’s problem was solved by a vigor-movement on the bed, where Sister Urania, caught in the violence of birth, was kicking her clothes away and screaming for to help her. Abner, swallowing like a schoolboy and shaking with embarrassment, approached the bed, and then strangely all of his uncertainty vanished, for he thought with boundless thanks to? God: “That is surely the head. It is a normal presentation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Outside, when the wail of the child was first heard, the two midwives said gravely, “He had better have the herbs ready.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, preoccupied with the baby boy he held in his hands and with the nerve-racking job of cutting the cord and then tying it, summoned desperately every memory of his midwife’s textbook and did a creditable job. Then he stood for a moment in the shadows, perplexed, holding the new child in his hands, and knowing not what to do, but finally he went out into the dawn and handed the child to a native woman, whom the Hawaiians had summoned twenty-four hours before, certain that she would be needed, and this woman placed the child to her breast.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first midwife said: “He ought to be watching the mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The second replied: “I wonder if he is massaging her stomach to help her throw out the afterbirth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And the first asked: “Do you suppose he would want these herbs?” And she indicated a brew that her people had used for two thousand years to stop bleeding.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the second replied: “He would not want them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Inside the shack Abner now feverishly thumbed his book, refreshing himself as to what he must do next. He cleaned the bed, washed the mother, listened to her breathing, and then saw with alarm that something was happening that the book did not tell about. “Brother Abraham!” he called in fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” the sick husband replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid she is bleeding more than she should.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Brother Abraham knew nothing, but he quickly looked through hi book, and while the two well-intentioned missionaries tried vainly to catch the shreds of knowledge that would have saved a life, on the rude bed Sister Urania grew weaker and weaker. The long day1! exertions and the long night’s exhaustion were inexorably exacting their toll, and her face grew gray.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She should not be sleeping so soundly,” Abner cried in panic,</p>

  <p class="normal">“What can we do?” Hewlett moaned. “Oh, God! Don’t let her die now!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Outside, the midwives said, “They ought to be massaging her stomach, but they seem to be talking, instead.” And gradually over the large crowd of natives that had stayed through the night, crept the knowledge that the frail white woman was dying. The idea came upon them like the rays of the morning sun, sweeping down from the coconut palms, so that the Hawaiians, to whom birth was a mystical matter, were already weeping before the missionaries knew that Urania had bled to death.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, sitting exhausted under a kou tree, Abner said dully, “Brother Abraham, I did all I could to save your dear wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was the will of God,” Hewlett mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">And yet,” Abner cried, hammering the medical text with his “there must have been something in here we didn’t read.” It was the will of God,” Hewlett insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hawaiians, watching, said, “How strangely the white men do things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are so smart about reading and guns and their new god,” an old woman observed, “that you’d expect them to have found a better way than this to birth a baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is most curious,” pointed out another, “is that in America men do the work of women,” but the old woman who had been most critical of the midwifery was first to acknowledge: “Even so, they make fine children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After the burial of Urania—the first of many mission women to die in childbirth or from physical exhaustion due to overwork—Abner arranged with natives to care for Abraham Hewlett, his newborn son and the latter’s wet nurse for the next two months until the difficult return journey to Hana at the tip of Maui was practical, and when these details were completed, Abner and the messenger climbed the hilly path to home; but they had not gone far when they heard a voice calling them, and it was Brother Abraham, pleading that they take his child with them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Lahaina there will be people to care for the boy,” he argued desperately.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner refused. “It would be unnatural.”</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What can I do with the boy?” Brother Abraham begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">The question was abhorrent to Abner, who replied, “Why, Brother Abraham, you will care for him, and bring him up to be a strong man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know about these things,” Brother Abraham mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Cease!” Abner cried sternly. “It is your duty to learn,” and he turned the distracted missionary around and sent him back to Wailuku and the responsibility of his child. When the ungainly man had left, Abner remarked hotly to the messenger, who could not understand, “I think that if he had had courage, his wife need not have died. If he had kept her at Hana, and done the best he could, all would have been well. Sister Urania was killed by the long climb to Wailuku. And the poor thing, eight months with baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">These thoughts drove him to the contemplation of his own wife, and he became afraid that news of Urania’s death in childbirth might have an adverse effect upon her, so he devised an illogical plan for suppressing the news. He reasoned, more from hope than from common sense: “It will be some time before word of this bad business reaches Lahaina. I shall say nothing of it to my dear wife.” He entered into a solemn compact with himself and even called God to witness, but when he reached home and saw the way in which Jerusha’s six little curls fell beside her face, and the manner in which she leaned forward in eagerness to greet him after their first days of separation since marriage, his words were faithful to the pledge, but his actions could not be, and he looked at her with such love and apprehension that she knew instantly what had happened. “Sister Urania died,” she cried.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“She did,” Abner confessed. “But you will not, Jerusha.” And for the first time he called her by her name.</p>

  <p class="normal">She started to ask a question, but he grasped her harshly by her two wrists and looked hard into her brown eyes. “You will not die, Jerusha. I promise you by God’s word that you will not die.” He released her and sat on a box, holding his tired head in his hands, and said, half ashamed of what he was about to admit, “God protects us in the most mysterious ways, Jerusha, and although my thoughts may in some respects seem horrible, nevertheless they are true. 1be-lieve that God took me to the death of Sister Urania so that I would be prepared when your time came. Now I know what to do. I know what Brother Abraham should have done. Jerusha, I am prepared, and you will not die.” He leaped to his feet and screamed, “You . . . will . . . not . . . die!”</p>

  <p class="normal">More than anything else in life he wanted, at that moment, to sweep his wife into his arms and embrace her with kisses, wild bellowing kisses like the sounds of animals in the meadows at home, but he did not know how to do this, so all of his love expressed itself in this one profound resolve. “You will not die,” he assured his wife, and from that moment on, no woman in a remote outpost, far from help, ever faced her last days of pregnancy with a sweeter resolution.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>BUT</span> IF <span>ABNER</span> thus found spiritual triumph in his missionary home, he encountered a fairly solid defeat at Malama’s grass palace, for when he went to give the Alii Nui her day’s lesson, her found that Kelolo had not moved to the new house built for him, but lived as usual with his wife. “This is an abomination!” Abner thundered.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two huge lovers, well into their forties, listened in embarrassment as he explained again why God abhorred incest, but when he was finished, big Malama explained quietly, “I built the house for Kelolo outside the walls, and it is a good house, but he doesn’t want to stay there alone.” She began to cry and added, “He tried it for two nights while you were away, but when I thought of him sleeping alone, I didn’t like it either, so on the third night I walked out to the gate and called, ‘Kelolo, come inside where you belong.’ And he came and it was all my fault. I am to blame, Makua Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will never be a member of the church, Malama,” Abner warned. “And when you die, you will suffer hellfire forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell me about hellfire again, Makua Hale,” Malama begged, for she desired to know exactly how much risk she was taking, and when Abner repeated his awful description of souls in eternal torment; Malama shivered and began asking specific questions while tears crept into her big eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are sure that Kamehameha the king is in such fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am positive.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Makua Hale, once a Catholic ship kapena came to Lahaina and spoke to me about God. Are Catholics in the fire too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are in the fire forever,” Abner said with absolute conviction.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the same ship kapena told me about the people in India who have not heard of your god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Malama, don’t speak of Him as my God. He is God. He is the only God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But when the people of India die, do they go into the fire, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So that the only people who escape are those who join your church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Triumphantly, she turned to Kelolo and said, “You see how terrible the fire is. If you keep that platform out there, hanging onto old gods the way you do, you will live in everlasting fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, no!” Kelolo resisted stubbornly. “My gods will care for me. They will never let me burn, for they will take me to their heaven, where I will live beside Kane’s water of life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is a foolish man!” Malama reflected sadly. “He’s going to burn and he doesn’t know it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But, Malama,” Abner pointed out, “if you continue to live with Kelolo in such horrible sin, you also will live in everlasting fire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” the big woman corrected. “I believe in God. I love Jesus Christ. I am not going to live in fire at all. I will keep Kelolo nth me only until I begin to feel sick. We have agreed that before I die I will send him far away, and then I shall be saved.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Abner played his trump card. Pointing his finger at her, he boldly faced her and warned: “But it is your minister alone who can let you enter the church. Have you thought of that?”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama pondered this unexpected news and studied her tormentor. Se was a foot shorter than she, less than half her age, and weighed about a third as much. Cautiously she probed: “And it will be you who judges whether I have been a good woman or not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will be the judge,” Abner assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And if I haven’t been . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will not be accepted into the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama reviewed this impasse for some time, looking first at Abner and then at Kelolo, until finally she asked briskly, “But maybe you won’t be here at the time, Makua Hale. Maybe there will be some other minister.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will be here,” Abner said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama studied this gloomy prospect, sighed in resignation, and then changed the subject abruptly. “Tell me, Makua Hale, what things must I do if I am to be a good Alii Nui for my people?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And Abner launched into the work which would have great political consequence in Hawaii. At first only Malama and Kelolo attended his daily instruction, but gradually the lesser alii reported, and when King Liholiho or his regent-mother Kaahumanu were in residence, they too appeared, questioning, rejecting, pondering.</p>

  <p class="normal">Constantly, Abner reiterated a few simple ideas. “There must be no slaves,” he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are slaves in America,” the alii countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is wrong in America, and it is wrong here. There must be no slaves.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are slaves in England,” his listeners insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And in both America and England good men fight against slavery. Good men should do the same here.” When his moral arguments bore no fruit, he resorted to exhortation, crying, “I was afloat on the ocean on my way to Hawaii, and we passed a ship at sundown, and it was a slave ship, and we could hear the chains clashing in the dismal holds. How would you like it, King Liholiho, if your hands were chained to a beam, and your back was cut with lashes, and the sweat poured down your face and blinded your eyes? How would you like that, King Liholiho?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would not like it,” the king replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the alii should see to it that no more babies are killed,” Abner thundered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama interrupted. “How should we greet captains from foreign warships when they come ashore at Lahaina?’’</p>

  <p class="normal">“All civilized nations,” Abner explained, using a phrase that was especially cherished by the missionaries, “conduct formal relations with other civilized nations. The captain of a warship is the personal representative of the king of the nation whose flag he flies. When he comes ashore, you should fire a small cannon, and you should have four alii dressed in fine robes, wearing pants and shoes, and they should present themselves to the captain and say . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no problem on which Abner was unprepared to give specific advice. This puny boy from the bleak farm at Marlboro, Massachusetts, had not in his youth foreseen that every book he read would one day be of value to him. He could recall whole passages about medical care in London, or the banking system in Antwerp. But most of all he remembered the studies he had conducted regarding the manner in which Calvin and Beza had governed Geneva, and it often seemed prophetic to him that each problem encountered by John Calvin in Switzerland now had to be faced by Abner Hale in Lahaina.</p>

  <p class="normal">On money: “You should coin your own island money, and protect it against counterfeiters.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On wealth: “Money is not wealth, but the things you make and grow are. It is supreme folly for you to allow individual chiefs to trade away your precious sandalwood. And for any man to grub op the very roots of young trees is insane. The greatest wealth you have is your ability to service the whaling ships as they come into Lahaina and Honolulu. If the alii were wise, they would establish port duties for such ships and also tax each merchant who supplies the whalers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On education: “The surest way to improve the people is to teach them to read.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On an army: “Every government needs a police force of some kind. I grant that if you had had a respectable army in Lahaina the whaling sailors would not have dared to riot. But I am afraid a large army such as you propose is ridiculous. You cannot fight France or Russia or America. You are too small. Do not waste your money on an army. But get a good police force. Build a jail.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the good alii: “He is courageous. He protects the weak. He is honest with government money. He listens to advice. He dresses neatly and wears pants. He has only one wife. He does not get drunk. He helps his people as well as himself. He believes in God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On Hawaii’s greatest need: “Teach the people to read.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But often when he returned to the mission he would cry dejectedly, “Jerusha, I truly believe they didn’t understand a word I said. We work and work and there is no improvement.” Jerusha did not share his apprehensions, for in her school it was obvious that she was accomplishing miracles. She taught her women to sew, to cook better and to raise their own babies. “You must not give your children away!” she insisted. “It is against God’s law.” She was pleased when they nodded, but her greatest joy was young Iliki, who had once run off to the whalers but who could now recite the Psalms.</p>

  <p class="normal">In teaching boys and men Keoki was indefatigable. He was both a devout Christian and a skilled instructor, so that his school was one of the best in the island group, but where he excelled was in his daily sermons, for he had the innate oratorical gift of the Hawaiian and exercised it in robust imagery and appropriate incident. So realistic was his description of the Flood that his listeners watched the sea out of the corners of their eyes, expecting engulfing waves to sweep in from Lahaina Roads.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in long-range importance the most effective school was Abner’s, where the alii studied, and his choice pupil was Malama’s daughter, Noelani, whom he had rescued from the sailors. The girl was, by birth, entitled to be the next alii nui, for her blood strain was impeccable. Her parents were full brother and sister, each noble in his own right, so that she inherited the glory of numberless generations of Hawaiian greatness. She was clever and industrious, an ornament in any society. In a report to Honolulu, Abner said of her, “She is almost as good a student as her mother. She can read and write, speak English and do the easier sums. And I feel certain that she is dedicated to the way of God and will be one of our first full members of the church.” When he told the girl this, she was radiant.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teaching Malama was more difficult. The great alii was stubborn to a point of obstinacy. She required everything to be proved and she had that irritating quality which teachers deplore: she remembered what the instructor had said the day before, for after each visit she recalled the steps of his reasoning, so that when he reappeared she was able to present him with his own contradictions. Few classes in the history of education were more stubbornly hilarious than those which occurred when Abner tutored Malama alone. She would lie prone on her enormous belly, her round moonlike face propped on her hands, demanding, “Teach me the way to attain grace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot do that,” Abner invariably replied. “You have got to learn it for yourself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">What made the lessons difficult was not Malama’s intellectual intransigence, which was pronounced, but her insistence upon answering all questions in broken English, which she quickly identified as God’s chosen language, since the Bible was written in English, and since those who were dear to God conveyed their thoughts in that language. She was determined to learn English.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, on his part, was equally insistent that the lessons be held in Hawaiian, for he saw that if he was to make progress in Christianizing the islands, he would have to speak in the native tongue. It was true that many of the Honolulu alii knew English, but it was not only to the alii that he intended speaking. Therefore, whenever Malama asked him a question in broken English, he replied in worse Hawaiian, and the lesson staggered on. For example, when he inveighed against eating dog, the conversation went like this: “Dog good kau kau. You no like for what?” Malama asked. “Poki pilau, pilau,” Abner explained contemptuously. “Pig every time sleep mud. You s’pose dog he make like that?” “Kela mea, kela mea eat pua’a. Pua’a good. Poki bad.” If each had used his own natural tongue, conversation would have been simple, for each now understood the other’s spoken language. But Malama stubbornly insisted that she be the first on Maui to speak English while Abner was equally determined to preach his first sermon in the new church in flowing Hawaiian.</p>

  <p class="normal">What irritated him most was that whenever he succeeded in backing big Malama into a logical corner, so that her next statement would have to be a confession of defeat, she would call on her maids to lomilomi her, and while they pounded her stomach, moving her enormous meals about, she would smile sweetly and say, “Go on! Go on!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So if civilized nations don’t eat dogs, neither should Hawaiians,’ Abner would argue, and Malama would call sweetly for her maids to brush his face with feathers: “Kokuo dis one man face. Fly too many on it, poor t’ing.” And while Abner fought with the infuriating feathers his argument would die away.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the two antagonists respected each other. Malama knew that the little missionary was fighting for no less than her entire soul. He would be content with no substitute, and he was an honest man whom she could trust. She also knew him to be a brave man who was willing to face any adversary, and she sensed that through her he intended to capture all of Maui. “That would not be a bad thing,” she thought to herself. “Of all the white men who have come to Lahaina”--and she recalled the whalers, the traders, the military-- “he is the only one who has brought more than he took away. After all, what is it he is trying to get me to do?” she reflected. “He wants me to stop sending the men into the forests for sandalwood. He wants me to build better fish ponds and to grow more taro. He wants me to protect the girls from the sailors, and to stop baby girls from being buried alive. Everything Makua Hale tells me is a good thing.” Then she would pause and think of her kapu husband, Kelolo. “But I will not give up Kelolo until just before I am going to die.” And so the warfare between Malama and Abner continued, but if a morning passed when duties kept him from the grass palace, Malama was uneasy, for her arguments with Abner were the best part of her day. She sensed that he was telling her the truth, and he was the first man who had ever done so.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the time came for Jerusha’s baby to be born she was faced by unwelcome news from Dr. Whipple: “I have been detained on Hawaii, where three mission wives are expecting babies, and it will be totally impossible for me to come to Lahaina. I am sure that Brother Abner will be able to handle the delivery capably, but nevertheless I beg your forgiveness. I am sorry.” She grew afraid.</p>

  <p class="normal">At one point she even went so far as to suggest: “Perhaps we should ask one of the local women to help us.” But Abner was adamant and quoted Jeremiah: ” ‘Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen,’” and he pointed out how unlikely it was that a heathen woman, steeped in idols and vice, would know how to deliver a Christian baby, and Jerusha agreed. But this time stubborn little Abner had so memorized Deland’s Midwifery, and Jerusha was finally so content to rely on him, that her boy was born without difficulty, and when Abner held the child for the first time he rather stolidly congratulated himself on having done such a good job of doctoring, but when the time came to place the boy in Jerusha’s left arm and apply the infant’s mouth to his wife’s breast, the floods of emotion that he had so long imprisoned within his tight heart burst loose, and he fell onto the earth beside the bed and confessed, “My dearest companion, I love you more than I will ever be able to explain. I love you, Jerusha.” And she, hearing these words of comfort in an alien land, the words she had so longed for, fed her child and was content.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will call the boy Micah,” he announced at last.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had thought some sweeter name, perhaps David,” she suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will call him Micah,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he strong?” she asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Strong in the goodness of the Lord,” Abner assured her, and within two weeks she was teaching her classes again, a slim, radiant missionary woman sweating in a heavy woolen dress.</p>

  <p class="normal">For one of the peculiarities of the missionaries was that they insisted upon living in tropical Hawaii exactly as if they were back home in bleak New England. They wore the same heavy clothing, did the same amount of tiring work, ate the same heavy meals whenever they could be obtained. In a land rich with Polynesian fruits, their greatest joy was to obtain from some passing ship a bag of dried apples, so that they could enjoy once more a thick, sweet apple pie. Wild cattle roamed the hills, but the missionaries preferred salt pork. There was an abundance of fish in the shallows, but they clung desperately to dried beef shipped out from Boston. Breadfruit they rarely touched, and coconuts were heathenish. In all his years on Maui, Abner Hale would never once do any of God’s official work unless costumed in underwear, heavy woolen pants, long shirt, stock, vest, heavy claw-hammer coat and, if the meeting were outside, his big beaver hat. Jerusha dressed comparably.</p>

  <p class="normal">But what was impossible to comprehend was the fact that each year, on the first of October, when the Hawaiian summer was hottest, mission families regularly climbed into heavy woolen underwear. They had followed this custom in Boston. They would follow it here. Nor did they ever find relief by swimming in the cool lagoon, for Bartholomew Parr’s London Medical Dictionary specifically warned them: “<span>NATATIO</span>. Swimming is a laborious exercise, and should not be continued to exhaust the strength. It is not natural to man as to quadrupeds, for the motions of the latter in swimming are the same as in walking.”</p>

  <p class="normal">All these conventions resulted in one of the most serious breaches between the Hawaiians and the missionaries. The former, who loved to bathe and who rarely did even twenty minutes’ work without sluicing themselves afterwards, found the missionaries not only dirty people but actually offensive in smell. Sometimes Malama, irritated by their sweaty odors, tried to suggest that Abner and Jerusha might like to swim on the fine kapu beach of the alii, but Abner rejected the invitation as if it had come from the devil.</p>

  <p class="normal">So all the accumulated wisdom of the islanders was ignored by the mission families. Perspiring in unbelievably heavy clothing, eschewing the healthful foods that surrounded them, they stubbornly toiled and grew faint and lost their health and died. But in doing so, they converted a nation.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1823, when the building of the church was two thirds completed, Kelolo approached Abner one evening with his final plea. “We can still change the entrance,” he argued. “Then the evil spirits will be sure to keep away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God keeps evil from His churches,” Abner replied coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you come with me to the grounds?” Kelolo begged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Everything has been arranged,” Abner snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to show you a simple way . . .” Kelolo began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Abner cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please,” the tall chief insisted. “There is something you must know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Against his better judgment, Abner threw down his pen and grudgingly walked in the night air to the church grounds, where a group of elderly men sat on their haunches, studying his church. “What are they doing?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are my praying kahunas,” Kelolo explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Abner protested, drawing back. “I do not want to argue with kahunas about a church of the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“These men love the Lord,” Kelolo insisted. “Ask them. They know the catechism. They want the church to be built strong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo,” Abner explained patiently, drawing near to the solemn kahunas, “I understand perfectly that in the old days these kahunas accomplished much that was good. But God does not require kahunas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Makua Hale,” Kelolo pleaded, “we have come to you as friends who love this church. Please do not keep the door where it is. Every kahuna knows that that is wrong for the spirits of this location.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God is the supreme spirit!” Abner argued, but since the night was pleasant, with a pale crescent moon in the west and occasional clouds sweeping in from the roads, he sat with the kahunas and talked with them about religion. He was surprised at how much of the Bible they knew, and at the skill with which they could accommodate it to their ancient beliefs. One old man explained, “We believe you are correct in what you say, Makua Hale. There is only one God, and we used to call Him Kane. There is a Holy Ghost, and we called Him Ku. There is Jesus Christ, and He is Lono. And there is the king of the underworld, and he is Kanaloa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God is not Kane,” Abner reasoned, but the kahunas merely listened, and when it came time for them to speak they said, “Now when Kane, that is God, wishes a church to be built, he supervises it. He always did when we built our temples.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“God does not personally supervise the building of this church,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kane did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But God is not Kane,” Abner patiently repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">The men nodded sagely and continued: “Now, since Kane is concerned about this church, and since we have always loved Kane, we thought it proper to advise you that this door . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The door will be where it now is,” Abner explained, “because that is where the door to a church has always been. In Boston the door would be here. In London it would be here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But in Lahaina, Kane would not like it to be here,” the kahunas argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kane is not God,” Abner stubbornly repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We understand, Makua Hale,” the kahunas politely agreed, “but since God and Kane are the same idea . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner insisted, “God and Kane are not the same.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” the kahunas agreed heartily, “their names are different, but we know that Kane would not like this door here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The door has to be here,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If it is, Kane will destroy the church,” the kahunas said sorrowfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God does not go about destroying His own churches,” Abner assured the men.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we know that Kane does, if they are built wrong, and since Kane and God mean the same thing . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">The solemn kahunas never lost their tempers with the stubborn little stranger who did not quite understand religion, so far as they could judge, and Abner had learned not to lose his, so the argument about the door lasted for several hours, until the moon had vanished from the west and only low dark clouds scudded across the mysterious and silent sky. With nothing agreed, but with the kahunas feeling very sorry for their misguided friend who insisted upon building a doomed church for Kane, the meeting broke up and Kelolo said, “After I bid the kahunas good night I will walk back home with you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can find my way alone,” Abner assured him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“On a night like this . . .” Kelolo said speculatively, looking at the low clouds over the coconut palms, “it would be better, perhaps . . .” And he bade the kahunas a hasty farewell so that he could hurry down the dusty road and overtake the missionary, but they had progressed only a few hundred yards when Abner heard the kahunas walking behind them, and he said, “I don’t want to argue with them any more,” but when Kelolo turned to tell the kahunas so, he saw nothing. There were no kahunas. There were no walking men. There was only an ominous echo under the scudding clouds, and suddenly Kelolo grabbed Abner in a vise of death and muttered in horror, “It is the night marchers! Oh, God! We are lost!” And before Abner could protest, Kelolo had caught him about the waist and swept him precipitately over a hedge and thrown him into a ditch, where foul water drenched him. When he tried to rise, Kelolo’s mighty arm pinned him to the wet earth, and he could feel that the huge alii was trembling in terror.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” Abner sputtered, but Kelolo’s giant hand clasped his mouth, accidentally forcing grass and mud into his lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is the night marchers!” Kelolo whispered, his lips quivering in horror.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who are they?” Abner whispered back, pulling Kelolo’s hand from his mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The great alii of the past.” Kelolo trembled. “I am afraid they are coming for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ridiculous!” Abner grunted, trying to break free. But his captor held him pinioned in the ditch, and he could feel the awful tenseness of the big man’s muscles. Kelolo was terrified.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why are they coming for you?” Abner whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one knows,” Kelolo replied, his teeth chattering. “Perhaps because I gave the land of Kane for your church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With the greatest circumspection he lifted his huge head until it was even with the top of the hedge, looked for a moment up the dark path, and shuddered. “They are marching toward us!” he gasped. “Oh, Makua Hale, pray to your god for me. Pray! Pray!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo!” Abner grunted, smothered by the pressure on his chest. “There is nothing out there. When alii die they remain dead.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are marching,” Kelolo whispered. And in the silence of the night, with only wind rustling through dead palm leaves, there was indeed a sound of feet. “I can see them coming past the church,” Kelolo reported. “They carry torches and feathered staves. They wear their golden robes and feather helmets. Makua Hale, they are coming for me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The giant alii pressed himself into the ditch, hiding Abner beneath his ample form, and the missionary could hear the man praying, “Oh, Pele, save me now; I am your child, Kelolo, and I do not want to die tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The sound grew louder and Kelolo engaged in violent actions, almost smothering Abner, who mumbled, “What are you doing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Undressing!” Kelolo grunted. “You cannot speak to the gods with clothes on.” When he was completely naked he resumed praying in an agitated voice, but suddenly he grew calm and Abner heard him say, “The little man I am hiding is Makua Hale. He is a good man and he brings learning to my people. He doesn’t know enough to throw off his clothes, so please excuse him.” There was a long silence, after which Kelolo said, “I know the little man preaches against you, Woman of Whiteness, but even so he is a good man.” There was another protracted silence, and then the sound of imminent feet, and Kelolo trembled as if a great wind tormented him and then he spoke: “Thank you, Pele, for having told the marchers I am your child.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The wind subsided. Only fitful sounds came from the topmost crowns of the coconut palms, and there was no echo of marching feet. It could have been the kahunas going home, Abner thought. It could have been a group of dogs. Or wind along the dusty footpath. Now there was no sound; the low scudding clouds were gone, and the stars shone.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What was it?” Abner asked, as he wiped the mud from his mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They were marching to take me away,” Kelolo explained. “Whom were you speaking to?” Abner inquired, spitting the gravel from his teeth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Pele. Didn’t you hear her tell the marchers that we were her children?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner did not reply. He brushed the sand from his clothes and wondered how he would get the muddy portions of his clothing cleaned, and he was brushing his knees when Kelolo grabbed him and spun him around, demanding, “You did hear Pele, didn’t you? When she protected you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did she mention my name?” Abner asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You heard her!” Kelolo cried. “Makua Hale, it is a very good sign when Pele protects a man. It means . . .” But his joy at having been saved from the revengeful night marchers was so great that he could not express his gratitude, either for her aid in saving him or for her unprecedented benevolence in protecting the little missionary. “You are my brother,” Kelolo said passionately. “Now you see that it would have been foolish for me to have torn down my platform to the gods. Suppose Pele had not come to help us tonight!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you see the night marchers?” Abner pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw them,” Kelolo replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you see Pele?” the missionary continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I often see her,” Kelolo assured him. Then in a burst of passion he caught Abner by the hands and pleaded: “It is for these reasons, Makua Hale, that I beg you not to keep the door where it is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That door . . .” Abner began. But he did not bother to finish his sentence, and when he reached home and Jerusha cried, “Abner, what have you been doing?” he replied simply, “It was dark and I fell in a ditch.” And the door was built where he intended.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, when it seemed as if the mission were gaining control of Lahaina, the whaler John Goodpasture, out of New Bedford, put in with a record tonnage of oil from the recently discovered Off-Japan whaling grounds, and Jerusha’s school for girls was suddenly interrupted by the excited cry from the road: “Kelamoku! Too many sailors inside boat! Come right away here!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since the John Goodpasture was well and favorably known in Lahaina from previous visits, the intelligence created much excitement, especially among the four daughters of Pupali, who spent the next few minutes darting significant glances at one another. Finally, they arose as a team and marched out of class. When Jerusha tried to stop them, the oldest girl explained that their youngest sister felt ill: “Poor Iliki head all come sore,” and amid loud giggles they disappeared.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Jerusha did not appreciate what had happened, but later when one of her students blurted out, “Kapena aloha Iliki. She swim ship, see kapena,” it became obvious that the mission’s moral teaching had been outraged, and Jerusha dismissed class. Wrapping a light shawl about her shoulders and placing her poke bonnet firmly on her brown locks, she marched down to the waterfront in time to see the four girls, largely naked, climbing eagerly aboard the John Goodpasture, where sailors who had known them before greeted them with cheers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Running up to an elderly American sailor who was scrimshawing a whalebone beside Kamehameha’s old brick palace, she cried, “Row me out to that boat!” But the sailor continued carving the whalebone and drawled, “Ma’am, it’s best if you don’t fight the laws of nature.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Iliki is only a child!” Jerusha protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“First law of the sea, ma’am. If they’re big enough, they’re old enough,” and he looked out into the channel, where the girls’ pleased squeals filled the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">Appalled by this indifference, Jerusha ran over to an old Hawaiian woman who sat on a rock guarding the four mission dresses which the girls had discarded. “Aunty Mele,” Jerusha pleaded, “how can we get those girls back?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You stop one time. Bimeby ship go,” Aunty Mele assured her. “Wahine come back, same like always.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In frustration, Jerusha grabbed at the besmirched mission dresses, as if to take them home with her, away from the contaminated waterfront, but Aunty Mele held onto them grimly, saying, “Hale Wahine! Bimeby wahine come back, I make ready dress for dem.” And like the good friend she was, she remained on the rock, holding the girls’ apparel until such time as they might need it once more for resumption of their missionary lessons.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night it was a gloomy mission household that reviewed the day’s defeats. “I cannot understand these girls,” Jerusha wept. “We give them the best of everything. Iliki in particular knows what good and evil are. Yet she runs off to the whaling ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I brought the matter up with Malama,” Abner reported in deep confusion, “and she said merely, ‘The girl is not an alii. She can go to the ships if she likes.’ So I asked Malama, “Then why were you so angry when the three sailors tried to take Noelani to their ship.’ And Malama replied, ‘Noelani is kapu alii.’ As if that explained everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner, I shudder to think of the evil that flourishes in Lahaina,” Jerusha replied. “When I left the waterfront, where nobody would do anything, I went into the town to ask for help, and at Murphy’s grog shop I heard a concertina. And girls laughing. And I tried to go in to stop whatever was happening, and a man said, ‘Don’t go in there, Mrs. Hale. The girls have no clothes on. They never do when the whalers are in port.’ Abner! What is happening to this town?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For some time I have known it to be the modern Sodom and Gomorrah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are we going to do about it?” “I haven’t decided,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, I have,” Jerusha said firmly. And that very night she marched down to Malama’s palace and said in her able Hawaiian, “Alii Nui, we must stop the girls from going out to the whaling ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Malama asked. “The girls go because they want to. No harm is done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But Iliki is a good girl,” Jerusha insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is a good girl?” Malama asked. “Girls who do not swim out&#160; to ships,” Jerusha replied simply. “I think you missionaries want to stop all fun,” Malama countered. “Iliki is not engaging in fun,” Jerusha argued. “She is engaging in death.” And this Malama knew to be true.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But she has always gone out to the ships,” she said sadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Iliki has an immortal soul,” Jerusha said firmly. “Exactly as you and I.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean to claim that Iliki . . . wahine i Pupali . . . like you or me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Exactly like you, Malama. Exactly like me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot believe it,” Malama said. “She has always gone to the ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is our job to stop her. To stop all the girls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama would do nothing that night, but on the next day she assembled the alii then in residence, and Reverend and Mrs. Hale presented their arguments, with Jerusha pleading: “You can tell a good town by the way it protects its babies and young girls. You can tell a good alii by the way in which he protects women. You are not good alii if you permit your own daughters to go out to the ships. In London the good alii try to stop such things. In Boston, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo contradicted this assertion by pointing out: “Kekau-ike-a-ole sailed on a whaler and he got to both London and Boston and he has often told us of how there were special houses filled with girls. Everywhere he went there were such houses.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But the good alii in all cities try to control this vice,” Jerusha argued bitterly.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Abner, however, who delivered the aching blow. “Do you know what happens if you alii of Lahaina permit your girls to be debauched in this way?” he asked ominously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What happens, Makua Hale?” Malama asked, for she trusted him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When the ships sail back home, the men laugh at Hawaii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence as this ugly accusation was digested, for the alii of Hawaii were proud people, desperately hungry for the world’s approval. Finally, Malama asked cautiously, “Would the alii of Boston allow their girls to swim out to a Hawaiian ship?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course not,” Kelolo snapped. “The water is too cold.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no laughter, for this was an honest observation, and Abner quickly added, “Kelolo is correct. The water in Boston is not so sweet and warm as here, but even if it were, no girls would be allowed to swim out to Hawaiian ships. The alii of Boston would be ashamed if that happened.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama asked quietly, “Do you think the sailors laugh at us, Makua Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know they do, Malama. Do you remember the whaler Carthaginian when it was here? I was aboard the Carthaginian on the whaling grounds, and the sailors were laughing about Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, but Honolulu is known to be an evil place,” Malama admitted. “That is why I will not live there. That’s why the king keeps his capital here at Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And they laughed at Lahaina,” Abner insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That is bad,” Malama frowned. After a while she asked, “What should we do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner replied, “You should build a fort, by the roads, and each night at sunset a drum should beat, and any sailor who is ashore should then be arrested and kept in the fort till morning. And any girl who swims out to ships should be put in jail, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Such laws are too harsh,” Malama said, and she dismissed the meeting, but when the other alii had gone she took Jerusha aside and asked querulously, “Do you think the sailors laugh at us, because of the girls?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I laugh at you!” Jerusha said firmly. “To think of people debauching their own daughters!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But they are not alii,” Malama insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are the conscience of the people,” Jerusha replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night the Hales argued long as to whether the daughters of Pupali should be admitted back into the mission school, and Abner was for dismissing them permanently, but Jerusha held that they should be given another chance, and when the John Goodpasture left the roads, the four delinquent girls, dressed neatly in new dresses, came penitently back. The more Jerusha preached to them about the miserableness of their sin, the more heartily they agreed. But when, some weeks later, a child heralded the arrival of the whaler Vashti with the exciting cry, “Vashti iron hook fall now, plenty kelamoku,” the four girls bolted again, and that night Abner insisted that the older three at least be expelled. They were, and since these were the years when whalers came to Lahaina with increasing frequency—seventeen were to arrive in 1824—the three older daughters of Pupali did a good business. They no longer had to go out to ships, for they became the dancers at Murphy’s grog shop and kept little rooms aft of the small dance floor, where they were permitted to keep half of the coins they earned.</p>

  <p class="normal">Iliki, the fairest of the daughters, was allowed to stay in the mission school, and under Jerusha’s most careful guidance grew to understand the Bible and to forswear whaling ships. She was slim for a Hawaiian girl, with very long hair and flashing eyes. When she smiled, her handsome white teeth illuminated her face, and Jerusha could appreciate why it was that men wanted her. “When she is twenty,” Jerusha said, “we will marry her to some Christian Hawaiian, and you mark my words, Abner, she’ll be the best wife in the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Jerusha spoke thus, Abner was not listening, for he had erected for himself, out of rough ends of timber gathered here and there—for nothing in Lahaina was more precious than wood—a small table upon which papers were spread in seven or eight neat piles, each with a sea shell placed on it to preserve order. For he had begun, in co-operation with the other missionaries throughout the islands, the work which would be his most lasting contribution to Hawaii. He was translating the Bible into Hawaiian and sending his pages as they were finished to the printer in Honolulu, where they were being published a little at a time.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nothing that Abner applied himself to in these years gave him greater pleasure, for he kept before him his Greek and Hebrew texts, Cornelius Schrevelius’ Greek-Latin Lexicon, plus those versions of the Bible he had studied at Yale. He was happy, like a plowman who turns furrows in a field without stones, or a fisherman who sets his nets for known returns. Usually he worked with Keoki, laboring over every passage with the most minute attention, and as the years passed he reached those two books of the Bible which he cherished most. The first was Proverbs, which seemed to him a distillation of all the knowledge man could hope to know. It was especially appropriate for Hawaii, since its crystallizations were in simple language, easily understood and long remembered, and when he came to the glorious closing pages in which King Lemuel describes the ideal woman, his pen truly flew along the ruled pages, for it seemed to him that Lemuel spoke specifically of Jerusha Bromley: “Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. . . . She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar. . . . She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. . . . Strength and honor are her clothing; . . . Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he finished translating Proverbs he left the last pages exposed, so that Jerusha might read them, and he was disappointed that she did not take notice of them, for she had learned not to interfere with his Biblical studies; so at last he was forced to hand her the pages of King Lemuel’s conclusions, and she read them quietly, saying only, “A woman would do well to mark those pages.” He was constrained to cry, “They were written about you, Jerusha!” but he said nothing, and put them along with the rest and forwarded them to Honolulu.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the decades that were to follow, more than six committees would have occasion to polish this first translation of the Bible into Hawaiian, and in the portions contributed from the big island of Hawaii, or from Kauai, or Honolulu, the scholars frequently found understandable errors in translation or emphasis. But in the portions for which Abner Hale had been responsible, they rarely found an error. One expert, with degrees from both Yale and Harvard, said, “It was as if he had been in turn a Hebrew and a Greek and a Hawaiian.” Abner did not hear this praise, for it came long after he was dead, but he reaped his full enjoyment from his great task when it came time to translate Ezekiel, for there was something about this strange book—a contrapuntal melody of the most banal observations and the most exalted personal revelations—that spoke directly to him and epitomized his life.</p>

  <p class="normal">He loved the recurring passages in which Ezekiel, who must have been a rather boring man most of the time, laboriously set down the specific dates on which God spoke to him: “Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day . . . that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. . . . The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel.” The assurance with which Ezekiel spoke on all matters, and his confidence that the Lord personally directed him, gave Abner great consolation, and whenever he copied out Ezekiel’s blunt statements of his correspondence with God, he felt that he, too, was participating in it: “In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day . . . , as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, . . . the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.” It was, to Abner Hale, clarity itself that the prophet Ezekiel, sitting in counsel with the elders of Judah, was markedly similar to the prophet Abner, sitting in counsel with the alii of Maui, and if the latter prophet sometimes spoke with an authority that the Hawaiians had difficulty in accepting, Abner felt that the elders of Judah must have had the same difficulty with the preachments of Ezekiel. Yet there it was in imperishable writing: “Again the word of the Lord came expressly unto me.” A man required no greater authority than that.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN 1825, Jerusha had a second baby, the saucy little girl Lucy, who was in later years to marry Abner Hewlett, whom her father had also delivered. As Kelolo’s big church neared completion, a serious problem confronted Abner, for he was determined above all things that when it was dedicated the Hawaiians who entered it must be dressed as proper Christians. “There will be no nakedness in this church,” he announced. “There will be no wreaths of maile branches, with their distracting fragrance. Women will wear dresses. Men will wear pants.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But even as he promulgated the law, he wondered where enough cloth would be found to convert these heathens into Christians. The alii, with access to cargoes from China, were well taken care of. They had worn proper clothing from the first, and in recent months many visiting naval captains had been astonished by the gigantic and solemn noblemen who greeted them at the small stone pier. “They would do credit to the city of London,” one Englishman reported to his superiors. “The men were dressed in black coats, proper trousers and yellow capes. The women wore strange but becoming dresses with a yoke at the neck, and an unbroken fall of expensive material from the tops of their bosoms to their ankles. When they moved, men and women alike seemed like gods, so straight and arrogant were they. They confided to me privately that a missionary from Boston had told them how to greet incoming ships properly, and if he has done as well with their souls as with their deportment he is to be commended, but this latter I doubt, for I have rarely seen so much open debauchery in any principal port as at Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was cloth for the poor people that worried Abner, and then from the coasts of China appeared his salvation. The hermaphrodite brig Thetis returned from its sandalwood expedition loaded with wares for sale in local markets. Captain Retire Janders, already committed to selling his ship to Kelolo, had determined to enter the trading business with a flourish and had gambled every farthing of his sandalwood sale in Canton on things he thought the Hawaiians might like. It was therefore an exciting moment when he opened his store next to Murphy’s grog shop and started unloading the bales from China.</p>

  <p class="normal">For men there were sturdy gabardine, shimmering silk shirts, knee-length black pants such as had been popular in France thirty years earlier, silk-ribbed stockings and shoes with fancy buckles. There were cigars from Manila, brandies from Paris, and one entire box filled with ready-made suits of which Captain Janders had told the Canton tailors, “Make each one big enough to hold three Chinese. These are for Hawaiians.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For the women the captain’s lures were irresistible: bolts of fine brocades, lengths of satin, whole dresses made of velvet, yard upon yard of green and purple cloth, with boxes of lace edging. There were glittering beads, and bracelets and rings; fans for hot nights, and perfumes from the Spice Islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">What the alii particularly prized, however, were the full-length mirrors, transshipped from France, and the massive mahogany furniture constructed in Canton from English patterns. Each noble family felt that it had to have a secretary, with two round rests for lamps and numerous pigeonholes for filing papers. The delicate chinaware was also appreciated, especially that in blue and white, but more treasured than tableware were the gleaming white chamber pots, decorated with raised roses, etched in pink and blue and green.</p>

  <p class="normal">And for the common people there were hundreds of bolts of turkey-red cloth, with some brown and white samples intermixed. It was this commodity that attracted Reverend Hale and led him to propose the strategy that laid the foundation for the Janders fortune.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have many bolts of good cloth here, Captain,” Abner pointed out. “I have long dreamed of having my congregation properly clothed when the church opens. But the people have no money. Will you extend them credit?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders tugged at the rim of beard that still fringed his face and said, “Reverend Hale, long ago you taught me to revere the Bible. I have got to stand on Proverbs 22, verse 26: ‘Be not thou one of them . . . that are sureties for debts.’ Thus saith the Lord, and it’s good enough for me. Cash! Cash! The rule of this establishment.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know that cash is a good rule,” Abner began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Lord’s rule,” Janders repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner said: “But it doesn’t have to be money cash, does it, Captain?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders said: “Well … if something could be converted . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner said: “A lot of whalers come into these roads, Captain. What do they need that my natives could supply?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders countered: “Why are they your natives?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner replied: “They belong to the church. What could they bring you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders mused: “Well, the whalers are always demanding tapa cloth for calking. And I could use a lot of olona twine.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner proposed: “If I could supply you with regular amounts of tapa and olona? Would you trade the cloth?”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Janders sealed the deal which became one of the principal foundations of his fortune, for the explosion of whalers into Lahaina Roads was about to occur—42 in 1825; 31 in 1826—and when they arrived, Captain Retire Janders calmly waited to service them with products supplied by Reverend Hale’s natives: tapa, olona, pigs, wild beef. At one point Kelolo protested: “Makua Hale, you used to fight with me when I took my men into the mountains for sandalwood. For me they worked only three weeks at a time. For you they work all the weeks.” But Abner explained to the simple-minded man: “They do not work for me, Kelolo. They work for God.” Nevertheless Kelolo insisted: “They still work all the time.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In one sense Abner did profit: he got each of his parishioners properly dressed for the opening of church, and on the Sunday when the sprawling edifice was consecrated, curious processions from miles around marched through the dust in their unaccustomed finery from Captain Janders’ store. The alii, of course, made a respectable showing, the men in frock coats and black hats, the women in handsomely gored dresses made from rich, thick stuffs from Canton. But the common people, even though they had watched the alii shift from tapa breechclouts to London jackets, had not quite caught the niceties of western dress. Women seemed to have found the easier solution: prim high collars on tight-fitting yokes which encased the bosom and from which hung copious folds of cloth; long sleeves hiding the offensive nakedness of the wrists; this costume was the essence of practicality and ugliness, and that beautiful women should have submitted to it was incomprehensible. It was completed by a broad-brimmed hat of woven sugar-cane leaves, decorated with imitation flowers, for real ones were not allowed in church lest they exhibit vanity and distract the congregation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Men faced more confusing problems, for each felt honor-bound to wear some one article from the Janders store, so that the first who entered the church after the alii wore a pair of shoes, a Bombay hat and nothing more. The second wore a man’s shirt with his legs pushed through the sleeves and the collar tied around his waist with a strand of olona twine. When Abner saw these ridiculous worshipers he was inspired to send them back home, but they were so eager to enter the new church that he allowed them to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next pair were brothers to whom Janders had sold a complete Canton suit; one wore the coat and nothing else; his brother wore the pants and white gloves. Now a man came wearing a woman’s dress, complete with a wreath of maile leaves about his head, and this time Abner was stern. “No flowers or pagan-smelling leaves in church,” he commanded, tearing away the wreath and throwing it to the ground, whence the fragrance penetrated to the church. Some men wore only shirts with tails flapping over enormous brown buttocks, and some wore grass breechclouts and silk neckties, but in deference to the white man’s God, who refused to share His mysteries with the naked, all wore something.</p>

  <p class="normal">The interior of the church was impressive: a perfect rectangle with handsomely matted grass walls, an imposing stone pulpit, and not a shred of other furniture except one wooden bench for Jerusha and Captain Janders. The multitude, more than three thousand of them, spread individual pandanus mats on the pebbled floor and sat tailor fashion, elbow to elbow. Had Abner studied the climate for even a moment, he would have built his grass walls only a few feet high, leaving open space between them and the room so that air could circulate, but churches in New England were built foursquare, and so they were in Hawaii, with no air stirring and the congregation sweltering in the natural heat, plus the radiation of three thousand closely packed bodies.</p>

  <p class="normal">The singing was magnificent: spontaneous, joyous, instinct with worship. The reading of the Scriptures by Keoki was impressive, and when Abner rose to deliver his two-hour sermon, the audience was thrilled to hear him speak in acceptable Hawaiian. He chose for his topic, Zephaniah 2, verse 11: “The Lord will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a sermon almost ideally suited for the occasion. Phrase by phrase Abner interpreted Zephaniah’s words. He defined the Lord and his powers, spending fifteen lyrical minutes in identifying the new god of the islands. It was a god of mercy and compassion that he expounded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he described the terribleness of Jehovah when His anger was aroused, and he lingered over floods, pestilences, thunder and lightning, famines and the tortures of hell. To his surprise the Hawaiians nodded understandingly, and he heard Kelolo whispering to Malama, “The new god’s just like Kane. Very difficult when he’s mad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner next turned to the specific gods of Lahaina whom the new God was determined to destroy. He specified Kane and Ku, Lono and Kanaloa, Pele and her attendants. “They shall perish,” Abner shouted in Hawaiian, “both from Lahaina and from your hearts. If you try to hide these evil gods in your hearts, you will be destroyed, and you will burn in hell forever and ever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After this he analyzed what the word worship meant, and here for the first time before the general public he expounded his view of the good society. “A man worships God,” Abner said, “when he protects his women, when he does not kill girl babies, when he obeys the law.” At one point he cried, “A man who grows better taro to share with his neighbors praises God.” At another he came closest to expounding pure New England doctrine when he suggested, “Look about you. Does this man have good land? God loves him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Does that man’s canoe catch more fish? God loves that man. Work, work, work, and you will find that God loves you.” Finally, with considerable courage, he stared directly at the alii and expostulated his concept of the good ruler, and the entire congregation, all but thirty of them commoners, heard a bold new concept of government. The sermon ended with one of the dramatic touches that Abner, like St. Paul before him, loved. He cried, “In the kingdom of God there is no higher and lower, there is no alii and slave. The lowliest man stands bright in the sweet gaze of God.” And he summoned from the doorway, for the man who would not otherwise have dared enter the edifice, a slave and he brought this slave to the pulpit area and put his arms about the man and cried, “You have previously called this man a foul corpse, one of the living dead. God calls him an immortal soul. I call him my brother. He is no longer a slave. He is your brother.” And inspired by the awfulness of this iconoclastic moment, Abner leaned up and kissed the man on the cheek and made him sit on the ground, not far from Malama, the Alii Nui.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the highlight of the dedication services came after a series of hymns led by Keoki, for Abner rose and announced, during the third hour of worship: “Entrance into the kingdom of God is not easy. Entrance into His church here on earth is not easy, either. But today we are going to allow two of your people to start their six months’ trial period. If they prove good Christians, they will be admitted to the church.” There was much excitement in the audience and open speculation as to who the chosen pair should be, but Abner stilled it by raising his hand and pointing to Keoki, tall, wiry and handsome.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Massachusetts your much loved alii, Keoki, was made a member of the church. He is the first Hawaiian to join. My dear good wife, whom you know as teacher, is also a member. So am I. So is Captain Janders. We four have met and have decided to test two others for membership. Mrs. Hale, will you rise and bring forth the first?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha rose from her mat on the side, walked forward to the alii area, reached down and grasped the hand of the slave. In slow, careful Hawaiian she said, “This kanaka Kupa is known in all Lahaina as a saintly man. He shares his goods with others. He cares for children that have no parents.” By her forceful enumeration of the man’s extraordinary virtues, which were acknowledged by all, Jerusha made the consecration of the slave logical to the congregation. “In your hearts, people of Lahaina, you know that Kupa is a Christian man, and because you know him to be such, we are going to accept him into the church of God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner took Kupa’s hand and cried, “Kupa, are you prepared to love Jehovah?” The slave was so terrified by the experiences the missionaries were forcing upon him that he could only mumble, and Abner announced: “In six months you will no longer be Kupa the Foul Corpse. You will be Kamekona.” And he gave the slave this treasured name, Solomon.</p>

  <p class="normal">The audience was stunned, but before there could be any murmuring against the radical move, Abner said in his powerful and persuasive voice, “Keoki Kanakoa, rise and bring forth the second member of the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And it was with the greatest excitement and joy that Keoki rose, went to the alii area and reached down for his sister Noelani, the Mists of Heaven. That morning she was dressed in white, with a yellow feather lei about her head and white gloves on her capable hands. Her dark eyes were ablaze with sanctity and she moved as if God and not her brother had reached down to touch her. From a distance she heard the joyous acceptance of her nomination as the Hawaiians whispered, and then she was aware that Abner was addressing her: “You have been faithful to the Lord’s ways. You have Studied and learned to sew, for all women, alii and commoner alike, should know how to sew, for does not the Bible say of the virtuous woman, ‘She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.’ But more than this, Noelani, you have been an inspiration to this island. In six months you will become a member of the church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In her sweet resonant voice Noelani replied, “I shall make the learning and the law of Jehovah my guide,” and Abner hid his irritation at the way these stubborn alii still insisted first upon the alphabet.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night Malama summoned Abner, and when he was perched cross-legged on the tapa before her reclining bulk she said solemnly, “For the first time today, Makua Hale, I understood what humility was. I saw, even though imperfectly, what a state of grace would be. Makua Hale, I have sent Kelolo to live in the other house. Tomorrow I am willing to lead a procession through the streets and announce the new laws for Maui. We must have a better way of living here. Will you have the laws ready for us to study at dawn tomorrow?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Today is the Sabbath,” Abner said flatly. “I cannot work today.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“An island waits to be saved,” Malama commanded. “Bring me the laws in the morning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will,” Abner surrendered.</p>

  <p class="normal">And on his way home, he stopped at the new house outside the wall and said, “Kelolo, will you work with me tonight?” And the outcast husband agreed, and they gathered Keoki, too, and Noelani and went to the mission house.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The laws must be simple,” Abner said with a show of statesmanship. “Everyone must understand them and approve them in his heart. Kelolo, since you will be the man who will have to organize the police and enforce the laws, what do you think they should be?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The sailors cannot roam our streets at night,” Kelolo said forcefully. “It is at night that they do their damage.” So Lahaina’s first and most contentious law was written into Abner’s rudely folded book: “A drum will sound at sunset, at which signal all sailors must return to their ships on pain of instant arrest and incarceration in the Lahaina jail.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The next law?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There must be no more killing of girl babies!’ Noelani suggested, and this became law.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The next?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Should we stop the sale of alcohol altogether?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Kelolo argued. “The storekeepers have already paid for their supplies and they would be ruined.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is killing your people,” Abner pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid there would be riots if we stopped the sale,” Kelolo warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could we stop the import of new supplies?” Jerusha proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“French warships made us promise to drink lots of their alcohol each year,” Kelolo pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could we forbid sales to Hawaiians?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“French warships said we had to make the Hawaiians drink their alcohol, too,” Kelolo explained, “but I think we should refuse to do so any longer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Without ever insisting upon his own opinion, Abner extracted from his group a short, sensible body of law, but when it was finished he saw that one of the most typical of all Hawaiian problems had been overlooked. “We need one more law,” he suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Kelolo asked suspiciously, for he feared some action against kahunas and the old gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Lord says,” Abner began in some embarrassment, “and all civilized nations agree . . .” He paused, ashamed to go on. After a moment’s hesitation he blurted out: “There shall be no adultery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo thought about this for a long time. “That would be a hard law to enforce,” he reflected. “I wouldn’t want to have to enforce that law . . . not in Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To everyone’s surprise, Abner said, “I agree, Kelolo. Perhaps we could not enforce it completely, but could we not get the people to understand that in a good society, adultery is not encouraged?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could say something like that,” Kelolo agreed, but then a look of considerable perplexity came over his features and he asked, “But which adultery are you talking about, Makua Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, which adultery?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo, Keoki and Noelani sat in silence, and Abner thought they were being obstinate until he realized that each was thinking very seriously. In fact, he saw Kelolo’s fingers moving and judged that the big alii was counting. “You see, Makua Hale,” the tall nobleman said, “in Hawaii we have twenty-three different kinds of adultery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You what?” Abner gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And this would be our problem,” Kelolo carefully explained. “If we said simply, ‘There shall be no adultery,’ without indicating which kind, everyone who heard would reason, ‘They don’t mean our kind of adultery. They mean the other twenty-two kinds.’ But on the other hand, if we list all the twenty-three kinds, one after the other, somebody will surely say, ‘We never heard of that kind before. Let’s try it!’ and things would be worse than before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, twenty-three kinds?” Abner asked weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” Kelolo replied, from expert knowledge, “there is a married man and a married woman. That’s one. Then there’s the married man and the wife of his brother. That’s two. Then the married man and the wife of his son. That’s three. Then we have the married man and his own daughter. That’s four.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s enough,” Abner protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It goes on through brothers and sisters, boys and their mothers, almost anything you could think of,” Kelolo explained matter-of-factly. “As long as one of the pair is married, we call it adultery. So how can we stop it?” he asked, palms up. “If we name all twenty-three kinds we’re going to have more trouble than we already have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was long after midnight and Abner sat chewing his pen. Like every religious leader in history, he knew that a good society started with a stable home, and that stable homes—either by design or accident—were usually founded on the disciplined sexual relationship of one man and one woman joined after due consideration of the world’s accumulated judgment on such matters. It was not good for a man to marry his sister. It was not good for families to interbreed endlessly. It was not good for girls to be taken when they were too young. But how could this accumulated wisdom be summarized for the Hawaiians?</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, he came up with an answer so simple, so sweetly right, that generations of Hawaiians smiled every time they heard Abner Hale’s profound directive. They smiled, because they understood exactly what he meant. It was a law that covered their experience on a tropical island, and of all the minor things Abner accomplished on Maui, this happy choice of words was most affectionately remembered among the people. For his final law read: “Thou shall not sleep mischievously.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On Monday morning Abner presented his simple forthright laws to Malama, and she studied them. Two she threw out as too meddling in the lives of her people, but the rest she liked. Then she summoned her two maids-in-waiting, and the three enormous women, dressed in fine China silks and broad-brimmed hats, formed a procession which was headed by two drummers, two men sounding conch shells, four with feathered staves, Kelolo in charge of eight policemen, Keoki, Noelani and a brassy-voiced herald. Abner and Jerusha stayed away, for this was the work of Hawaiians for Hawaiians.</p>

  <p class="normal">The drums began to beat, and when the conches sent their shrill blast through the kou trees, Malama and her two attendants started walking past the fish pond, along the dusty road beside the alii’s houses, and into the center of the town. Whenever more than a hundred people assembled, coming running from all sides, Malama would command the drums to cease and direct her herald to cry: “These are the laws of Maui. Thou shalt not kill! Thou shalt not steal! Thou shalt not sleep mischievously!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The drums resumed, leaving people gasping in the morning sunlight. Fathers, who had been earning their poi by rowing their daughters out to the whalers, were stunned and some tried to argue with Kelolo, but he silenced them and marched on.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the little pier Malama halted and had the bugle blown four times, assembling such sailors as were available at that hour. Two captains were present, and stood with their caps in their hands, listening to the astonishing news: “Sailors shall not roam the streets at night. Girls shall not swim out to the whaling ships.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“By God!” one of the captains muttered. “There’ll be hell to pay for this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll find it was the missionary who did it,” the other predicted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God help the missionary,” said the first, running by a back way to Murphy’s grog shop, but he had barely exploded the news when Malama and her two stout ladies hove majestically into view with the rumpled paper containing the new laws. This time, as the drums finished beating before Murphy’s establishment, there were two special laws promulgated: “Girls shall no longer dance nude in Murphy’s grog shop. From today no more alcohol may be sold to Hawaiians.” The drums resumed beating. The bugles sounded, and Malama and her two enormous ladies-in-waiting retired. The laws had been handed down. It would now be Kelolo’s job to enforce them.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night there were riots. Sailors from several ships stormed through the town fighting with Kelolo’s inadequate policemen. Girls were ripped away from their beds and hauled against their wills out to the ships. And toward midnight a body of some fifty sailors and Lahaina merchants gathered at the mission house and began cursing Abner Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He done the laws!” a sailor howled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He talked the fat lady into it!” another cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s hang the little bastard!” a voice called, and cheers greeted the suggestion.</p>

  <p class="normal">No immediate action was taken, but someone in the crowd started throwing rocks at the grass house, and occasionally one would ricochet into the room and fall harmlessly to the floor. “Let’s burn his damned house down!” a voice screamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll teach him to meddle in our affairs!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come out here, you damned little worm!” a harsh voice called.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come out! Come out!” the crowd roared, but Abner kept huddled on the floor, protecting Jerusha and the two babies with his body lest the increasing storm of rocks find them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The long night progressed with its vile insults, but toward morning the crowd dispersed, and as soon as the sun rose, Aimer hurried to consult with Kelolo. “It was a bad night,” the big alii said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think tonight will be worse,” Abner predicted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Should we discard the laws?” Kelolo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Never!” Abner snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we had better ask Malama,” the tall chief suggested, but when they found her, townspeople were already there, bombarding her with their fears, and it was then that Abner realized what a tremendous woman she was. “Malama has spoken,” she said sternly. “The words are law. I want you to assemble all the ships’ captains in this room within an hour. Get them!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Americans appeared, rough, rugged, good-looking veterans of the whaling grounds, she announced in English, “The law, me I gib you. More better you t’ink so, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” one of the captains interrupted. “We been comin’ to Lahaina for a dozen years. We always had a good time here and behaved ourselves pretty well. I can’t say what’s goin’ to happen now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can say!” Malama cried in Hawaiian. “You are going to obey the laws.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our men got to have women,” the captain protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you riot in the streets of Boston?” Malama demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For women? Yes,” the captain replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the police stop you, is that not right?” Malama pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The captain wagged his forefinger and threatened, “Ma’am, no police on this pitiful island better try to stop my men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our police will stop you!” Malama warned. Then she changed her tone and pleaded with the captains: “We are a small country, trying to grow up in the modern world. We have got to change our ways. It is not right that our girls should swim out to the ships. You know that. You have got to help us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” one of the captains growled stubbornly, “there’s gonna be trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then there will be trouble,” Malama said softly and sent the captains away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo wanted to back down. Keoki was afraid there would be serious rioting, and Noelani counseled caution, but Malama was obdurate. She sent messengers to summon all the biggest men from the outward areas. She went in person to the new fort to see if its gates were strong, and she told Kelolo, “Tonight you must be ready to fight. The captains are right. There is going to be trouble.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when her people had gone about their tasks, and when they could not spy upon her, she summoned Abner and asked him directly, “Are we doing the right thing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are,” he assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And there will be trouble tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Very bad trouble, I am afraid,” he admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then how can we be doing the right thing?” she pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He told her of a dozen incidents in the Old Testament wherein men faced great adversaries in defense of God’s way, and when he was through he asked her in a low voice, “Malama, do you not know in your heart that the laws you read were good?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are part of my heart,” she replied cryptically.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then they will prevail,” Abner assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama wanted to believe, but the cowardice of her other advisers had infected her, so now she towered above Abner, stared down at him and said, “Little mikanele,” using the Hawaiian pronunciation of missionary, “tell me the truth. Are we doing the right thing?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner closed his eyes, raised his head toward the grass roof, and cried in the voice that Ezekiel must have used when addressing the Jewish elders: “The islands of Hawaii will live under these laws, for they are the will of the Lord God Jehovah.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Assured, Malama turned to other matters and asked, “What will happen tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They won’t bother you, Malama, but I think they may try to burn my house. Can Jerusha and the children stay with you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course, and you too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll be in the house,” he said simply, and as he limped away, Malama loved her stubborn little mikanele.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night the streets of Lahaina were a shambles. At dusk a drunken sea captain, in conjunction with Murphy, led a group of men to the fort and dared the policemen there to blow the conch shell. When the warning to sailors sounded, the mob grabbed every policeman in sight and threw them into the bay. Then they stormed back to Murphy’s, where Pupali’s three oldest daughters were dancing in the nude to wild shrieks of joy. As bottles were passed, sailors shouted, “Drink up. When this is done, the missionary says we can’t have no more.” The reiteration of this cry so maddened the mob that someone shouted, “Let’s have done with that little pisser for all time.” And they stormed into the street, heading for the mission house, but on the way someone proposed a better plan: “Why bother him? Why not burn his goddamned church? It’s made of grass!” And four men scurried through the night with torches, pitching them high onto the grass roofing. Soon the night breezes had whipped the flames across the top of the structure and had started them down the sides.</p>

  <p class="normal">The great beacon thus lighted had consequences that the rioters had not foreseen, for the people who had worked upon this church had grown to love it as a symbol of their town, and now that it was ablaze, they rushed to save it. Quickly the area around the church was filled with sweating, silent, urgent men and women who beat at the walls to keep them from going up in flames, and by the incredible labors they performed that night, they saved more than half the walls, drenching them with water and beating at them with brooms and bare hands. The sailors, aghast at the bravery with which these illiterate islanders worked, withdrew and watched in wonder.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when the people of Lahaina saw how little was left of their beloved church, where words of great hope had been preached to them, they became furious to the point or hysteria, and an islander cried, “Let us throw the sailors into jail!” The fire fighters greeted this challenge with cheers, and a wild manhunt was launched.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wherever a sailor was spotted, three or four big natives crashed down upon him, often leaving him unconscious under some heavy woman who sat on him, banging his head while her men went off in search of others. Bo’s’ns, captains, common sailors were treated alike, and any who resisted had their arms or jaws broken. When the assault was over, Kelolo sent official policemen around, searching for bodies which he pitched into the new jail. Then, with the foresight of a politician, he went personally among the piles of Americans and searched out all the captains, saying to each in his most fatherly voice, “Kapitani, I sorry inside me. We no see good, we t’ink you crew, we boom-boom good too much. No pilikia, I take care of you.” And he took them to Murphy’s and bought each man a drink, but as they pressed their broken lips to the glass, he was pleased to see how badly scarred they were.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the next dusk, the conches sounded and a good many sailors climbed into boats and returned to their ships. Those that didn’t were chased through the town, not by policemen, but by infuriated gangs of Hawaiians bent on thrashing them. But whenever a sailor was caught, some policeman was ready to rescue him, and by eight o’clock the jail was full. On the third night, most of the sailors who were caught ashore after curfew sought out the police, to whom they willingly gave themselves up, preferring that to the coursing mobs. And by the fourth night, order was restored in Lahaina. Kelolo’s police were in command.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the next day, Malama, at Kelolo’s suggestion, summoned the whaling captains to her grass palace, where a feast had been spread. She greeted each bruised skipper with personal warmth and commiserated with him over the rude behavior of her people. She fed the captains well, offered them fine whiskey, and then proposed: “Our lovely church is burned. It was an accident, I am sure. Naturally, we want to rebuild it, and we will. But before we do, we want to do something for the fine Americans who come to Lahaina. Therefore we are going to build a little chapel for sailors. It will give them a place to read, and pray, and write letters home to their dear ones. Will you kind men set the example and give a few dollars for the chapel?” And by her daring charm she wheedled more than sixty dollars from the astonished captains, and another of Abner Hale’s dreams, one that he had entertained since that day off the Four Evangelists when the sailors went swinging through the arcs of heaven, was realized: the Seamen’s Chapel at Lahaina.</p>

  <p class="normal">BY 1828 it seemed that Abner’s world was at last beginning to be well organized. He had a rude desk and a whale-oil lamp by which he translated the Bible. He had three schools functioning with increasing success, and the day seemed not too far distant when Iliki, Pupali’s youngest and loveliest daughter, would be married in church to one or the other of the established Hawaiian men who were trying with increasing regularity to peek into Jerusha’s school. Captain Janders’ return to Lahaina and his announced decision to settle down as a ship chandler, with his wife and children coming out from New Bedford, gave Abner a polished mind with whom he could conduct discussions; while the captain’s happy knowledge that young Cridland, the devout sailor from the Thetis, was footloose in Honolulu, where the ship’s company had been disbanded, encouraged Abner to direct a letter to the youth, asking him to throw in his lot with the Seamen’s Chapel, so that Cridland was now employed there, giving guidance to the younger sailors who arrived in Lahaina on the rapidly increasing whaling fleet—45 whalers in 1828; 62 in 1829.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama was rapidly approaching a state of grace, so that it seemed assured that she would be accepted into the rebuilt church when it was dedicated, and there were really only two difficulties looming on the broad and lovely horizon at Lahaina. Abner had anticipated the first, for when it came time to rebuild the church, Kelolo announced that the kahunas wished to consult with Abner again, but he replied, “The door will stay where it was. All this talk in the community that the kahunas knew the church would be destroyed irritates me. Some drunken sailors burned it and that’s that. Your local superstitions had nothing whatever to do with it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Makua Hale!” Kelolo protested gently. “We did not wish to speak about the door. We know your mind is made up, and we know that your church will always be unlucky. But there is nothing we can do about that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did the kahunas want to see me about?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come to the church,” Kelolo begged, and when Abner met with the wise old men they pointed to the two-third walls and the absent ceiling and made this proposal: “Makua Hale, it has occurred to us that the last church was very hot indeed, what with more than three thousand people huddled on the floor and no wind to cool them off.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was warm,” Abner agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would it not therefore be a wise thing if we did not build the destroyed walls any higher? Would it not be better, indeed, if we could pull them down even farther? Then we could erect high posts and raise the ceiling as it was before, so that when the church is finished, the winds will move across us and cool us as if we were on the shore.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It took some minutes for Abner to comprehend this radical suggestion and he tried to piece its various components together in his mind. “You mean, tear the present walls down to here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even lower, Makua Hale,” the kahunas advised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well . . .” Abner reflected. “Then raise the pillars as before?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, and hang the ceiling from them, as before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you wouldn’t have any walls,” Abner protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The wind would move over us, and that would be better,” the wise men explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But there would be no walls. A man sitting here,” and he squatted on the ground, “could look up and watch the sky.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would that be wrong?” Kelolo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But a church always has walls,” Abner replied slowly. He thought of every church he had ever seen in New England. The very essence of a church was that it have four rugged, square walls and a steeple above them. Even the pictures he had seen of churches in foreign lands showed four walls, and those that did not were clearly popish, so he said firmly, “We will build the church as before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will be very hot,” Kelolo warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A church must have walls,” Abner said, and he left the wondering kahunas.</p>

  <p class="normal">The second difficulty could not have been foreseen, at least not by Abner Hale. It concerned Keoki Kanakoa, whose school was accomplishing wonders in bringing Hawaiian boys from the Stone Age into the present. Half the sailors aboard the Thetis, as it plied from Lahaina to Honolulu on weekly trips, were young men trained by Keoki. The boys who worked at the mission printing press, publishing the Bible, were his boys, too. In community life he was a rugged, dependable tower of Christian strength, and his Bible readings in formal services were inspiring. It should not have been surprising therefore -- but it was -- when Keoki appeared in Abner’s grass house one day and asked, “Reverend Hale, when can I hope to be ordained a full minister?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner rested his pen and looked at the young man in astonishment. “A minister?” he gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, I was told at Yale that I must return to Hawaii and become a minister to my people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you already work with them, Keoki,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I believe I am ready to have a church of my own,” Keoki suggested. “In some new part of the island where the people need God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But there can’t be a church without a missionary, Keoki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” the handsome Hawaiian asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well . . .” Abner began. He threw down the pen. “I have no plans for ordaining Hawaiians,” he said bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Keoki pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well . . . It’s never even been considered, Keoki,” Abner explained. “You do excellent work in the school … of course . . . but a full-fledged minister?&#160; Oh, No!&#160; That would be ridiculous. Impossible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I thought you missionaries came here to educate us … to get us ready to take care of ourselves.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We did, Keoki!” Abner assured him. “You have heard me talk with your mother. I insist that she govern every aspect of the island. I touch nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have been fine about that,” Keoki acknowledged. “But the church is more important than the government.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Exactly,” Abner jumped. “The government could fail because of your mother’s errors, and that would be no irremediable harm, but if the church failed because of your error . . . Well, Keoki, the damage could never be repaired.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But how will you know whether I am strong enough to do God’s work unless you test me?” Keoki pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“With the life of the church at stake, Keoki, we can take no chances.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does that mean that I can never become a minister? Here in my own land?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Gravely, Abner leaned back in his chair and thought: “Somebody better tell him the facts.” So he said coldly, “Would you have the strength, Keoki, to discipline your fellow Hawaiians as God requires? Would you seek out those who lead a lewd life and announce their names on Sunday? And track down those who drink? Would you dare to expel the alii who smokes? Could I trust you to use the right words in explaining the Bible? Or to refuse bribes when the alii want to join the church? Keoki, my dear son, you will never have the courage to be a true minister. For one thing, you are too young.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am older than you were when you became a minister,” the Hawaiian pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but I grew up in a Christian family. I was . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A white man?” Keoki asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abner replied with equal frankness. “Yes, Keoki, my ancestors fought for this church for a hundred years. From the day I was born I knew what a heavenly thing, what an inspired, divine thing the church was. You don’t know yet, and we can’t trust the church in your hands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are saying very bitter things, Reverend Hale,” Keoki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you remember aboard the Thetis, when I gave the old whaler in the fo’c’s’l the Bible, and how he brought ridicule on the Bible and on me and on God? That’s what happens when we risk the welfare of the church in the wrong hands. You must wait, Keoki, until you have proved yourself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have proved myself,” Keoki said stubbornly. “I proved myself at Yale College, when I stood in the snow begging an education. I proved myself at Cornwall, where I was the top student in the mission school. And here in Lahaina I have protected you against the sailors. What more must I do to prove myself?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Those acts were your duty, Keoki. They qualified you for church membership. But to qualify for the ministry itself! Perhaps when you are an old, tested man. Not now.” And he dismissed the arrogant young man.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was rather startled when, in discussing these matters with Jerusha, she sided with Keoki, arguing, “Your commission, Abner, from the American Board that sent you here was to train up the Hawaiians so that they could organize and run their own churches.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Organize them and run them, yes!” Abner instantly agreed. “Soon we will take in more members and institute a board of deacons. But to make a Hawaiian a minister! Jerusha, it would be complete folly. I couldn’t tell poor Keoki, but he will never become a minister. Never.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s a heathen. He’s no more civilized than Pupali’s daughters. One good hurricane, and he would lose all his veneer of civilization.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But when we are gone, Abner, we shall have to turn the church over to Keoki and his fellows.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We shall never go,” Abner said with great solemnity. “This is our home, our church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean to stay here forever?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. And when we die, the Board in Boston will send out others to take our places. Keoki running a church! Impossible!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Abner had acquired the habit of listening to his wife, and long after their discussion ended he brooded about what she had said, and at last he found a reasonable solution to the impasse over Keoki, and he summoned the young Hawaiian. “Keoki,” he announced happily, “I have discovered a way whereby you can serve the church as you desire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean I can be ordained?” the young man cried joyfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not exactly,” Abner replied, and he was so preoccupied with his satisfactory answer to Keoki’s problem that he failed to observe how disappointed the latter was. “What I’m willing to do, Keoki, is to make you the luna of the church, the top deacon. You move among the Hawaiians and find out who is smoking. You check to see who has alcohol on his breath. Each week you hand me a list of people to be admonished from the pulpit, and you draw up the names of those to be expelled from church. At night you will creep quietly through Lahaina to let me know who is sleeping with another man’s wife. I am willing to have you do these things for the church,” Abner concluded happily. “How do you like that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki stood silent, staring at the little missionary, and when the latter asked again for his response Keoki said bitterly, “I sought a way to serve my people, not to spy upon them.” And he stalked from the mission, remaining in seclusion for many days.</p>

  <p class="normal">If Jerusha and Keoki could not stand up to Abner’s arguments against the Hawaiians, a visitor was about to descend on Lahaina who not only marshaled all of Jerusha’s doubts and expressed them in vigorous English but who also brought along many of his own. It was Dr. Whipple, lean and brown from years of work on distant outposts, who came in one day on Kelolo’s ship, the Thetis. He hurried immediately to the mission house and shouted, “Sister Jerusha, forgive me for not being here when you were pregnant. Good heavens! I forgot you have two children. And pregnant again!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The years had mellowed Whipple and given him a strong no-nonsense vernacular. He had witnessed too much death—wives, children, black-frocked men who worked themselves to death—to bother any longer with the niceties of expression that had characterized the Thetis. “I had the same stateroom coming over. Only four other men in it with me, and I felt lonely. Sister Jerusha, how’s the medicine box?” And he yanked the black box down and checked its contents against the new medicines he had lately received from Boston. “I’m giving you lots of ipecac,” he advised. “We find it very good for children’s fevers. And tonight you and Brother Abner and I are going to have a big dinner with Retire Janders in his new store. And because I was seasick on the damnable Thetis again, I’m going to have some whiskey. You’ll be seasick too, when you go back to Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are we required to go?” Abner asked, for like Jerusha he preferred to remain in Lahaina, finding Honolulu, at the yearly meeting of the missionaries, a dirty, dusty, ugly little collection of hovels.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Dr. Whipple said sadly, “I’m afraid it’s going to be a difficult meeting, this one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s the matter?” Abner asked. “They going to discuss pay for the missionaries again? I explained my position last time, Brother John. I shall always be unalterably opposed to salaries for missionaries. We are here as God’s servants and we require no pay. My mind will not change on this.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That isn’t the subject,” Whipple broke in. “I don’t agree with you on the salary question. I think we ought to be paid wages, but that’s beside the point. We’ve all got to vote on the case of Brother Hewlett.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Abraham Hewlett!” Abner repeated. “I haven’t heard from him since his baby was born. And he’s on the same island with me. What is the question about Brother Abraham?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Haven’t you heard?” Whipple asked in astonishment. “He’s in trouble again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s he done?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s married a Hawaiian girl,” Whipple said. There was a long, shocked silence in the grass house, during which the three missionaries stared at each other in amazement.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, Abner took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead. “You mean to say he’s actually living with a native woman? A heathen?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the meeting is to decide what to do about him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s nothing to decide,” Abner said flatly. He went for his Bible and thumbed it for a moment, finding the text that applied to the case. “I think Ezekiel 23, verses 29 and 30, covers such behavior: ‘And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.”” He closed the Bible.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are they determined in Honolulu to throw him out of the church?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Dr. Whipple said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What else could they do?” Abner demanded. “A Christian minister marrying a heathen. ‘Gone a whoring after the heathen!’ I do not want to go to Honolulu, but it seems my duty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple said, “Would you excuse us, Sister Jerusha, if we walk down to the pier?” And he led Abner along the lovely paths of Lahaina, under the gnarled hau trees and the palms. “You are fortunate to live here,” Whipple reflected. “It’s the best climate in Hawaii. Plenty of water. And that glorious view.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What view?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you come down here every night to see the best view in the islands?” Whipple asked astonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wasn’t aware . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look,” Whipple cried, as a kind of poetry took command of him, tired as he was from seeing so many bleak Hawaiian prospects. “To the west the handsome rounded hills of Lanai across a few miles of blue water. Have you ever seen gentler hills than those? Their verdure looks like velvet, thrown there by God. And to the north the clean-cut rugged mountains of Molokai. And over to the south the low hills of Kahoolawe. Wherever you look, mountains and valleys and blue sea. You lucky people of Lahaina! You exist in a nest of beauty. Tell me, do you ever see the whales that breed in the channel here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve never watched for any whales,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A sailor told me, as I was cutting off his arm, that one night at Lahaina he saw a dozen whales with their babies, and he said that all his life he had been harpooning whales and had thought of them only as enormous, impersonal beasts so huge that the ocean was scarcely large enough to hold them. But when his arm was gangrenous and he knew that he was going to lose it, he, for the first time, observed whales as mothers and fathers, and they were playing with their babies in the Lahaina Roads, and he told me … Well, anyway, he won’t be throwing a harpoon any more.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was not listening. He was doing something he had not done before: he was looking at the physical setting in which his whaling town existed. To be sure, he had seen the hills behind the town, for he had walked over them, but he had not appreciated the glorious ocean roads: jeweled islands on every side, the deepest blue water, white sands and the constant scud of impressive clouds. He understood why the whaling ships were content to anchor here, for no storm could get at them. From all sides they were protected, and ashore they had Lahaina for water, and fresh meat and cool roads.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is rather attractive,” Abner admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was sorry to hear your view on Brother Hewlett,” Dr. Whipple began when he had found a comfortable rock.</p>

  <p class="normal">It’s not my view,” Abner replied. “It’s the Bible’s. He went whoring after a heathen.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let’s not use that old-style language,” Whipple interrupted. “We’re dealing with a human being in the year 1829. He isn’t a strong human being and I never liked him much . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, Brother John? Old-style language?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He wasn’t whoring after heathens, Brother Abner . . . Do you mind if I quit this brother calling? Abner, this man Abraham Hewlett was left alone at Hana with a baby boy and not a damned thing to guide him in the care of that child.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother John!” Abner exploded. “Please do not offend me with such language. And besides, Brother Abraham had as much . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And the Hawaiian girl wasn’t a heathen. She was a fine, Christian girl … his best student . . . and I know, because I delivered her baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She had a baby?” Abner asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, a fine baby girl. She named her Amanda, after my wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was it . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I no longer count the months, Abner. They’re married now and they seem very happy, and if there is any system of morality which requires a lonely man like Abraham Hewlett . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hardly comprehend your words any longer, Brother John,” Abner protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have buried so many people, cut off so many legs . . . Many of the things we used to worry about at Yale don’t worry me any more, ancient roommate.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But surely you would not allow a man like Brother Hewlett to remain in the church? With a heathen wife?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wish you would stop using that word, Abner. She’s not a heathen. If Amanda Whipple were to die tomorrow, I’d marry such a girl any day, and Amanda would want me to. She’d know at least that her children had a good mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The others will not think as you do, Brother John.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Immanuel Quigley does, I’m proud to say. And that’s why I’ve come to Lahaina. We want you on our side. Don’t drive poor Hewlett from his church.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Lord saith, “Thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen.’” Dully, Abner closed the discussion, but in doing so he began to wonder about John Whipple. What the doctor said next erased the wonder and confirmed the doubt.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been doing a great deal of speculation recently, Abner,” he began. “Do you think we’ve done right in bursting into this island kingdom with our new ideas?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The word of God,” Abner began, “is not a new idea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I accept that,” Whipple apologized. “But the things that go with it? Did you know that when Captain Cook discovered these islands he estimated their population at four hundred thousand? That was fifty years ago. Today how many Hawaiians are there? Less than a hundred and thirty thousand. What happened to them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">To Whipple’s surprise, Abner was not particularly shocked by these figures, but asked casually, “Are your facts correct?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain Cook vouches for the first. I vouch for the second. Abner, have you ever seen measles strike a Hawaiian village? Don’t. Ppppsssshhhh!” He made a sound like fire rushing through the grass walls of a house. “The entire village vanishes. For example, do you make your church members wear New England clothes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have only nine members,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean that in this entire . . .” Dr. Whipple threw a pebble into the blue waters and watched a near-naked Hawaiian riding the surf onto the kapu beach. “On Sundays, for example, do you require a man like that one out there to wear New England clothes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. Doesn’t the Bible specifically state, ‘And thou shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness’?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you ever listen to the hacking coughs that fill the church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do, and I’m terribly worried.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m afraid that in another thirty years the Hawaiians will be not a hundred and thirty thousand but more likely thirty thousand. Out of all those who were here when we came, twelve out of thirteen will have been destroyed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Lahaina was never any bigger,” Abner replied prosaically.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not the town, perhaps, but how about the valleys?” Whipple, as was his practice in touring the islands, called an old man to the seaside and asked in Hawaiian, “In that valley, did people used to live?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“More thousand was stay before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many live there now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tree. Ikahi, ilua, ikulu. Tree.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In that valley over here, did people used to live?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“More two t’ousand was stay before.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many live there now?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All dis fellow stay before, now make . . . die,” the old man answered, and Whipple dismissed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s that way in all the valleys,” he said gloomily. “I think the only thing that will save Hawaii is some radical move. There has got to be a big industry of some kind. Then we must bring in some strong, virile new people. Say from Java, or perhaps China. And let them marry with the Hawaiians. Maybe . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You seem beset with doubts,” Abner marked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Whipple confessed. “I am terribly afraid that what we are doing is not right. I am certain that we are sponsoring the spread of consumption and that these wonderful people are doomed. Unless we change things right away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are not concerned with change,” Abner said coldly. “Hawaiians are the children of Shem, and God has ordained that they shall perish from the earth. He has promised that their lands shall be occupied by your children and mine, Genesis 9, verse 27: ‘God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem.’ The Hawaiians are doomed, and in a hundred years they will have vanished from the earth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple was aghast, and asked, “How can you preach such a doctrine, Abner?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is God’s will. The Hawaiians are a deceitful and licentious people. Even though I have warned them, they continue to smoke, they circumcise their sons and abandon their daughters. They gamble and play games on Sunday, and for these sins God has ordained that they shall be stricken from the face of the earth. When they are gone, our children, as the Bible directs, shall inherit their tents.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But if you believe this, Abner, why do you remain among them as missionary?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because I love them. I want to bring them the consolation of the Lord, so that when they do vanish it will be to His love and not to eternal hellfire.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not like such religion,” Whipple said flatly, “and I do not aspire to their tents. There must be a better way. Abner, when we were students at Yale, the first tenet of our church was that each individual church should be a congregation unto itself. No bishops, no priests, no popes. Our very name bespoke that conviction. The Congregationalists. But what do we find here? A system of bishoprics! A solemn convocation to throw a poor, lonely man out or the ministry. In all these years you’ve allowed nine people to join your church as full members. Somewhere, Abner, we’ve gone wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It takes time to convert the heathen to true . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Whipple protested. “They are not heathen! One of the most brilliant women I have ever met or read about was Kaahumanu. I understand you have one like her here on Maui, your Alii Nui. Heathen? The word doesn’t mean anything to me any more. For example, have you admitted any of your so-called heathen to the ministry? Of course not.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, finding the turn of Whipple’s argument most distasteful, rose to go, but his old roommate grasped him by the hand and pleaded: “You have nothing more important to do today than talk with me, Abner. I find my soul wandering from its moorings, and I seek guidance. I had hoped that when you and Jerusha and Captain Janders and I sat down together, something of the spirit that animated us on the Thetis . . .” His voice trailed off, and after a while he confessed, “I am sick with God.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Abner asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The spirit of God fills my brain, but I am dissatisfied with the way we administer His word.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are speaking against the church, Brother John,” Abner warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am, and I’m glad that you said so, for I was ashamed to.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is the church that has brought us here, Brother John. It is only through the church that we build our accomplishments. Do you think I would dare to speak to the alii as I do if I were plain Abner Hale? But as the instrument of the church I can dare all things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even wisdom?” Whipple inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If your mind suddenly comprehended a new wisdom . . . some radical new concept of existence . . . well, could you as a servant of an all-powerful church dare to accept that new wisdom?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There is no new or old, Brother John. There is only the word of God, and it is revealed in the church, through the instrumentality of the Holy Bible. There can be no greater than that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No greater,” Dr. Whipple agreed, “but there can be a different.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not think so,” Abner replied, and he wished to hear no more of this argument and left. But that night, in the warm fellowship of Captain Janders’ excellent dinner, with good wine, and whiskey for the doctor, the old friends relaxed and Janders said, “Lahaina’s becoming a first-rate city, thanks to Abner Hale’s exertions.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is that girl who’s bringing in the dishes?” Abner asked, for her face seemed familiar, yet he did not recognize it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders blushed ever so slightly, in a way that Abner missed but which Dr. Whipple had seen often in the islands. “I understand you’re bringing Mrs. Janders and the children out from Boston?” Whipple said by way of rescue.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Janders replied quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We need all the Christians we can get,” Abner said heartily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you intend remaining here?” Whipple asked directly. “In Lahaina, that is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the jewel of the Pacific,” Janders replied. “I’ve seen all the towns, and this is best.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll be in trade, I judge?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I see great opportunity for ships’ chandlery here, Doctor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you suppose there is any way … it would be difficult I grant you . . . but do you suppose that if a man with good native connections could get some canoes at Hana . . . well, if he had some fine land there and energy, do you suppose he could grow things and sell them to you … for the whalers, that is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You speaking of Abraham Hewlett?” Janders asked abruptly, “Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If he could grow hogs . . . beef … I might buy ‘em. He ever think of growing sugar? We could use a lot of sugar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll speak to him about sugar,” Whipple said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You expect him to be giving up the church at Hana?” Janders inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I fear the Honolulu meeting is going to expel him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Captain Janders sat very thoughtfully for some moments. He did not want to offend Reverend Hale, with whom he must live in intimacy, and yet he had always liked young John Whipple’s honest approach to life. “Tell you what I’d be willing to do,” he said slowly. “If Hewlett could get his stuff to me in the whaling season … on time and in good shape . . . well, I judge I could use everything he produces. But I want one thing he may not be willing to give.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s that?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hear his wife has claim to a nice piece of land at Hana, more than Abraham could possibly farm. Isn’t he the scrawny fellow with big eyes that slept in your stateroom? He’s the one I had in mind. I want him to enter into a contract with me so that I manage that land. I’ll tell him what to grow and he won’t ever have to worry about where his next meal’s comin’ from,” Janders promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it came time for the Thetis to carry the missionaries to Honolulu, Abner discovered the thrill that ugly memories yield when they have receded with their pain, for he was to bunk in his old stateroom and John Whipple would share it; but his pleasure was considerably dampened when a canoe arrived from the other end of Maui bearing the missionary Abraham Hewlett, his handsome little boy Abner, and his Hawaiian wife, Malia, the native pronunciation of Mary.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are they sailing with us?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course. If we don’t have them, we don’t have a trial.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Won’t it be embarrassing if Hewlett’s on the same ship with us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not for me. I’m voting for him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think hell be put in our stateroom?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He shared it with us once,” Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two missionaries looked with interest as Mrs. Hewlett, if anyone so dark could be given that name, came aboard the Thetis. She was taller than her husband, very broad-shouldered and grave of manner. She spoke to the little boy in a soft voice, and Abner whispered in disgust, “Is she talking to that child in Hawaiian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Dr. Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My children are not allowed to speak a word of Hawaiian,” Abner replied emphatically. ” ‘Learn not the way of the heathen!’ the Bible directs us. Do your children speak Hawaiian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” Whipple replied with some impatience.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s very unwise!” Abner warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We live in Hawaii. We work here. Probably my boys will go to school here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mine won’t,” Abner said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where will you send them?” John asked with some interest, for he often discussed the matter with his wife.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Board will send them to New England. Then to Yale. But the important thing is that they never come into contact with Hawaiians.” Dr. Whipple watched the Hewletts cross the deck and go down the hatchway aft, and the manner in which the Hawaiian woman watched over little Abner Hewlett proved that whereas she might have crept into the father’s bed by some trick or other, she certainly loved the child.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Boy’s lucky,” Whipple said. “He’s got a good mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She doesn’t look the way I expected,” Abner confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You expected a painted whore?” Whipple laughed. “Abner, once in a while you ought to look at the reality of life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How did she become a Christian?” Abner pondered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abraham Hewlett took her into the church,” Whipple explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a thoughtful pause, and then Aimer asked, “But how could they have been married? I mean, if Hewlett was the only minister who could have married them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For the first year nobody did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean, they lived in sin?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And then I came along … on one of my regular trips. I was in a Russian ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you married a Christian minister to a heathen?” Abner asked, aghast.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I’m probably going to be censured, too,” Whipple said dryly. “And I have a suspicion in here,” and he touched his heart, “that I won’t accept the censure. I stand with St. Paul: ‘It is better to marry than to burn.’ Can anyone seriously doubt that Abraham is better off today than he was when you left him in Wailuku?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The meeting in Honolulu went as expected. At first Abraham Hewlett made a sorry spectacle of himself, confessing that in marrying the Hawaiian girl Malia he had sinned against the decrees of God, thus bringing degradation upon both himself and the church. He begged forgiveness, asking the brethren to remember that he had been left alone with an infant boy; and at the recollection of his misery in those lonely days he wept. Later, when it was suggested that perhaps the sly Hawaiian woman had been responsible for his downfall, he recovered a portion of his dignity by avowing that he loved this gracious, tender girl and that it was he who had insisted upon the marriage, “and if the brethren think they dare imply censure of Malia, they are indeed mistaken.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The vote was an easily predicted condemnation and expulsion, only Whipple and Quigley speaking in defense. The meeting thought it best that the Hewletts leave the islands: “For your presence here would be a constant humiliation to the church. But it is recognized that it would be equally disgraceful for a Christian minister—an unfrocked one, that is—to return to America with a Hawaiian wife, for there are many in America who are eager to castigate missionaries, and your appearance among them would merely add ammunition to their blasphemies. It is therefore concluded that you and your family ought . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Abraham’s tears were dried and he interrupted bluntly: “It is not within your province to advise me in these matters. I shall live where I wish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will receive no sustenance from us,” the meeting reminded him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have entered into a contract to raise pigs and sugar cane for the whaling ships at Lahaina, and beyond this you are required to know nothing. But before I go I must point out that your mission is founded upon an impossible contradiction. You love the Hawaiians as potential Christians, but you despise them as people. I am proud to say that I have come to exactly the opposite conclusion, and it is therefore appropriate that I should be expelled from a mission where love is not.” Dr. Whipple thought that when the scrawny man with the big eyes finally left the judgment room, he departed with some dignity.</p>

  <p class="normal">The meeting then turned to the doctor’s case and condemned him for having married the pair, thus constituting himself, as one minister pointed out, “the agency, if not the cause, whereby our miserable brother from Hana fell into temptation and sin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple retorted, “I should rather have thought that I was the agency whereby he fell out of sin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This sally, being both witty and cogent, furthered the case against the doctor, and all the missionaries except Quigley joined in a vote of censure. Whipple was reproved and advised to be more circumspect in the future. To Abner’s surprise, his roommate accepted the condemnation and sat without even a look of resentment as the meeting turned to less weighty matters, including assignments of the mission family to new posts.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when it came time for the Thetis to return to Lahaina, Abner was surprised to find Dr. Whipple, his wife Amanda, and their two boys ensconced in the stateroom. “I thought you were directed to go to Kauai,” Abner remarked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where I am directed to go and where I go are two vastly different matters,” Whipple said easily, and Abner was relieved to notice that they had no luggage, so apparently they were on a short visit to one of the way islands, Molokai or Lanai. But when these ports were cleared, the Whipple family was still aboard, and at the pier in Lahaina, John grabbed Abner’s hand and said, “Don’t leave. I want you to witness exactly what happens. There’s Jerusha. I’d like to have her come along, too, because I don’t want contradictory reports circulated regarding what I’m about to do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And with his wife and children in tow, he led the Hales to Captain Janders’ store and said boldly, “Captain, I have come to throw myself on your mercy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Janders asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re doing a large business here, Captain, and with more whalers coming each year, you’ll need a partner. I want to be that partner.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You leaving the mission?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Over the Hewlett affair?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, sir. And others. I happen to believe that men who work should get a just salary.” He tugged at his ill-fitting trousers, pointed at Amanda’s dress and said, “I’m tired of going down to the mission grab bag in Honolulu to see what scraps the good people in Boston have sent us this year. I want to work for myself, get my own wage, and buy my own things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does Amanda feel the same?” Captain Janders asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She does.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you, Amanda?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I love the Lord. I love to serve the Lord. But I also love an organized home, and in these matters I am with my husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You got any money to put into the venture?” Janders asked warily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My family comes to you with absolutely nothing,” the handsome dark-haired doctor, then twenty-nine, replied. “We have these clothes, picked from the rag bag, and that is all. I have no medicine, no tools, no luggage. Certainly I have no money. But I have a knowledge of these islands that no other man on earth has, and that’s what I offer you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you speak the tongue?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perfectly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders thought a moment, then stuck out his rugged hand. “Son, you’re my partner. On the Thetis, when you asked so many questions, I remarked you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have only one request, Captain,” Whipple said. “I want to borrow enough money . . . right now . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll fix you up with clothes and a place to live.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Enough money to buy my own medical outfit. And anyone who wants medical advice from me can get it free. For I am a servant of the Lord, but I am determined to serve Him in my way, and not some other.”</p>

  <p class="normal">By the end of the week the Whipples had moved into a small grass shack, which Kelolo gave them along with a substantial square of land in return for medical care for Malama, whose exertions on behalf of the new laws had taxed her strength, and at the start of the next week the first of many signboards that were to become famous throughout Hawaii appeared on the dusty main streets of Lahaina: “Janders &amp; Whipple.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ABNER’S DISTURBING EXPERIENCES</span> in Honolulu, where both Abraham Hewlett and John Whipple had challenged the missionary board, confirmed his natural suspicion that there was inherent danger from too close relationships with the Hawaiian savages, and it was under the impetus of this fear that he built a high wall around his entire establishment, leaving an extra gate at the rear through which Jerusha could exit to her girls’ classes, held in an open shed under the kou trees. Within the wall not a word of Hawaiian was spoken. No Hawaiian maid was allowed to enter unless she knew English, and if a deputation of villagers came to see Abner, he would carefully close the door leading to where his children were, and he would take the Hawaiians to what he called “the native room,” where their voices could not be heard by the little ones.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must not learn the ways of the heathen!” Abner constantly warned his family, for what Abraham Hewlett had suggested in Honolulu regarding all missionaries was particularly true of Abner: he loved the Hawaiians, yet he despised them. He was therefore not in very good humor when Kelolo came to visit him one night, which forced him to close off the children’s room, lest they hear Hawaiian being spoken.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it you want?” he asked testily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In church the other day,” Kelolo said in Hawaiian, “I listened to Keoki read that beautiful passage from the Bible in which this man begat that man, and the other man begat another man.” The big chief’s face was radiant with pleasant memory of the Biblical message which Hawaiians loved above all other. “The Begats,” they called it among themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner had long been curious about this partiality for the chapter in Chronicles, for he felt sure the Hawaiians could not understand it. “Why do you like that passage so much?” he probed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo was embarrassed, and looked about to see if anyone was listening. Then he confessed somewhat sheepishly, “There is much in the Bible we do not understand. How could we? We don’t know the many things the white man knows. But when we hear “The Begats,’ it is like music to our ears, Makua Hale, because it sounds just like our own family histories, and for once we can feel as if we, too, were part of the Bible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean, family histories?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“That is what I came to see you about. I see you at work translating the Bible into my language, and we appreciate your hard work. Malama and I were wondering, if before she dies . . . No, Makua Hale, she is not well. We wondered if you would write down for us in English our family history. We are brother and sister, you know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” Abner mumbled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am the last one who knows the family history,” Kelolo said. “When Keoki should have been learning it, he was learning about God. Now he is too old to memorize the way I did when I was studying to be a kahuna.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, a learned man, instantly saw the value of preserving old fables, and asked, “How does a family history sound, Kelolo?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want you to write it as if Keoki were saying it. I am doing this for him, so that he will know who he is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How does it begin?” Abner pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was dark in the grass house, with only one feeble whale-oil lamp swaying with its retinue of shadows, when Kelolo, seated cross-legged on the floor, began: “I am Keoki, the son of Kelolo who came to Maui with Kamehameha the Great; who was the son of Kanakoa, the King of Kona; who was the son of Kanakoa, the King of Kona who sailed to Kauai; who was the son of Kelolo, the King of Kona who died in the volcano; who was the son of Kelolo, the King of Kona who stole Kekelaalii from Oahu; who was the son of . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">After Abner had listened for a while, his curiosity as a scholar overcame his initial boredom at this tedious and probably imaginary ritual. “How did you memorize this genealogy?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“An alii who doesn’t know his ancestry has no hope of position in Hawaii,” Kelolo explained. “I spent three years memorizing every branch of my family. The kings of Kona are descended, you know, from the . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are these genealogies real, or made up?” Abner asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo was amazed at the question. “Made up, Makua Hale? It is by these that we live. Why do you suppose Malama is the Alii Nui? Because she can trace her ancestry far back to the second canoe that brought our family to Hawaii. Her ancestor was the High Priestess Malama who came in that second canoe. My name goes back to the first canoe from Bora Bora, for my ancestor was the High Priest of that canoe, Kelolo.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner suppressed a smile as the illiterate chief before him tried to establish relations with some mythical event that must have occurred ten centuries before, if at all. He thought of his own family, in Marlboro. His mother knew when her ancestors reached Boston, but no one could recall when the Hales had got there, and here was a man who could not even write, claiming . . .</p>

  <p class="normal">“You say you can remember the canoes in which your people came?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course! It was the same canoe on each trip.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can you remember that?” Abner demanded sharply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our family has always known its name. It was the canoe Wait-for-the-West-Wind. It had Kelolo as navigator, Kanakoa as king, Pa at one paddle and Malo at the other. Kupuna was the astronomer and Kelolo’s wife Kelani was aboard. The canoe was eighty feet long by your measures and the voyage took thirty days. We have always known these things about the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean a little canoe like that one at the pier? How many people did you mention. Seven, eight? In a canoe like that?” Abner was contemptuous of the man.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was a double canoe, Makua Hale, and it carried not eight people but fifty-eight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was dumfounded, but once more his historical sense was excited, and he wished to know more about the myths of these strange people. “Where did the canoe come from?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“From Bora Bora,” Kelolo said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, yes, you mentioned that name before. Where is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Near Tahiti,” Kelolo said simply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your people came in a canoe from Tahiti . . .” Abner dropped the question and said, “I suppose the family history ends there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no!” Kelolo said proudly. “That is not even the halfway mark.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was too much for Abner, and he stopped abruptly calling it a family history. He realized that he had got hold of one of the classic myths of the Hawaiian islands, and he said bluntly, “I’ll copy it down for you, Kelolo. I would like to hear the story.” He adjusted the swinging lamp, took fresh sheets of paper, and laid aside for some nights his Bible translation. “Now tell me very slowly,” he said, “and don’t leave out anything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the darkness Kelolo began to chant:</p>

  <p class="normal">“The time of the birth of the tabu chief, The time when the bold one first saw light, At first dimly like the rising of the moon In the season of the Little Eyes in the ancient past. The great god Kane went into the goddess Wai’ololi And the offspring of light were born, the bringers of men, Akiaki who dragged the islands from the sea And gentle La’ila’i who made the flowers and the birds, And in the evening of the long day Akiaki knew his sister, And the man was born, bringer of honor and war . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as Kelolo chanted the historic summary of his people the little room was filled with the clash of-battle, the birth of gods, the abduction of beautiful women and the explosions of ancient volcanoes. Men in yellow capes, carrying spears, marched from one lava flow to another; queens fought for their children’s rights and brave men perished in storms. In time Abner fell under the spell of the fabulous events, these made-up memories of a race, and when Kelolo and Malama and the canoe Wait-for-the-West-Wind made their second journey from Bora Bora to Hawaii the little missionary caught a momentary thrill of the vast ocean and its perils as Kelolo, sitting in the darkness, chanted what purported to be the song of directions for that imaginary voyage:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Wait for the west wind, wait for the west wind,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Then sail to Nuku Hiva of the dark bays</em></p>

  <a id="section_3"></a>

  <p class="normal"><em>To find the constant star.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Hold to it, hold to it</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Though the eyes grow dim with heat.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">But whenever Abner found his mind prepared to accept some small aspect of the narrative as true, ridiculous legendary events intruded, like Kelolo’s account of how his ancestor in Bora Bora left for the trip north at the height of a hurricane, with waves forty feet high.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Imagine a Hawaiian canoe even venturing out of port in a strong wind!” Abner laughed to Jerusha as he recounted some of the more fantastic passages in the history. “Just look! Right here we have more than forty generations of supposedly historic characters. Now if you allot twenty years to each generation, and that’s conservative, Kelolo wants us to believe that his ancestors came here more than eight hundred years ago and then went back to get a second canoeload. Impossible!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Kelolo finished his genealogy--128 generations in all-- Abner prudently made a copy of what he termed “this primitive and imaginary poem” and sent it to Yale College, where it formed the basis for most accounts of Hawaiian mythology; scholars appreciated in particular the detailed descriptions of the conflict between the Bora Bora god Kane and the Havaiki god Koro. Abner himself had slight regard for his work, and when he summoned Keoki to present the original he said condescendingly, “Your father claims it’s a family history.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is,” Keoki bristled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now, Keoki! More than a hundred and twenty-five generations! Nobody can remember . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kahunas can,” Keoki said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You sound as if you were defending the kahunas,” Abner suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the recitation of family histories, I am,” Keoki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But this is ridiculous . . . mythology . . . fantasy.” Abner slapped the manuscript with disdain.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is our book,” Keoki said, clutching it to his bosom. “The Bible is your book, and these memories are our book.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How dare you, a man who presumes to ask when he will be made a minister?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why is it, Reverend Hale, that we must always laugh at our book, but always revere yours?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because my Book, as you improperly call it, is the divine word of God, while yours is a bundle of myths.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are ‘The Begats’ any more true than the memories of the kahunas?” Keoki challenged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“True?” Abner gasped, his temper rising with his astonishment. “One is the divinely revealed Word of the Lord. The other . . .” He paused in contempt and ended, “Good heavens, do you consider them equal?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think there is much in the Old Testament that is merely the work of kahunas, nothing more,” Keoki said firmly. Then, to repay Abner for his arrogance, he asked in confidence, “Tell me, Reverend Hale, don’t you honestly think that Ezekiel was mostly kahuna?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You had better go,” Abner snapped icily, but he felt some shame for having goaded the boy, so he put his arm about his shoulder and pointed to a canoe on the beach. “Keoki,” he reasoned quietly, “surely you must know that a canoe like that could not carry fifty-eight people for thirty days … all the way from Tahiti.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki moved so that he could see the broad, silvery passageway that lay between Lanai Island and Kahoolawe, leading south. “Reverend Hale, do you recall the name of that stretch of water?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t they call it Keala-i-kahiki?” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And have you ever heard the name of that point at Kahoolawe?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s likewise Keala-i-kahiki Point. What do you suppose Keala-i-kahiki means?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” Abner reflected, “Ke means the; ah means road; i means to; and I don’t know what kahiki means.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You know that what we call k, the people to the south call t. Now what does kahiki mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Against his will, Abner formed the older word, of which kahiki was a late corruption. “Tahiti,” he whispered. “The Way to Tahiti.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Keoki said. “If you sail from Lahaina, pass through Keala-i-kahiki Strait and take your heading from Keala-i-kahiki Point, you will reach Tahiti. My ancestors often sailed that way. In canoes.” And the proud young man was gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Abner refused to accept such claims, and by consulting many Hawaiians he proved to his satisfaction that the word kahiki meant not Tahiti but any distant place, so he added his own note to the Yale manuscript: “Keala-i-kahiki may be translated as ‘The Path to Far Places’ or ‘The Beyond.’” Then, as if to prove that Abner was right, the Hawaiian captain of Kelolo’s ship Thetis got drunk, stayed in his cabin during a storm, and allowed his sturdy old veteran of many seas to climb upon the rocks off Lahaina, where it rotted through the years, a visible proof that Hawaiians could not even navigate in their own waters, let alone penetrate distant oceans.</p>

  <p class="normal">IT <span>WAS WHILE</span> Abner was drafting a letter to Honolulu, advising the mission board that his assistant Keoki Kanakoa was behaving strangely, so that perhaps the board ought to consider Keoki’s reassignment to some post of lesser importance, that the news was shouted through the still morning air that was to disrupt Lahaina for many days. Pupali’s oldest daughter came screaming to Jerusha’s school: “Iliki! Iliki! It has arrived! The Carthaginian!” And before the startled Jerusha could intercede, the bright-eyed beauty had leaped over the bench and dashed madly away with her sister. Together they swam out to the sleek whaler, with the dark sides and the white stripe running lengthwise, where naked and shimmering in the sunlight they were both gathered into the arms of the bark’s tall captain and led below to his quarters, from which he shouted, “Mister Wilson, I don’t want to be interrupted till tomorrow morning. Not even for food.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But he was interrupted. Kelolo dispatched three policemen to the Carthaginian under orders to drag Pupali’s daughters off to jail, but when they climbed aboard the whaler, Mister Wilson met them on the afterdeck, shouting, “Get away! I’m warning you!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We come fetch wahines,” the officers explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ll get broken jaws!” Mister Wilson threatened, whereupon one of the policemen shoved out his elbows, knocked the first mate aside and started for the after hatchway. Mister Wilson, thrown off balance for a moment, tried to lunge at the intruder, but another of the policemen grabbed him, which became the signal for a general scuffle, in which, because most of the men were ashore, the three rugged policemen appeared to be winning.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What the hell’s going on here?” came a roar from the lower deck, followed by a lithe form, tall and muscular, leaping up the ladder. Captain Hoxworth was dressed only in a pair of tight sailor’s pants, and when he saw what was happening on his ship, he lowered his head, lunged at the first policeman and shouted, “Into the ocean with “em!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The agile officer saw Hoxworth coming, sidestepped with agility, and brought his right forearm viciously across the back of the captain’s neck, sending him sprawling across the deck, where the New Englander cut his lower lip on his own teeth. Wiping the blood onto the back of his hand, Hoxworth glimpsed the red stain, and from his knees cried ominously, “All right!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Rising slowly, testing his bare feet on the decking, Hoxworth moved cautiously toward the policeman who had pole-axed him. With a deceptive lunge to the right, followed by a snakelike twist to the left, Hoxworth brought his powerful right fist into the policeman’s face. Then, with the Hawaiian’s head momentarily snapped back, Hoxworth doubled up his own head and shoulders and drove into the man’s stomach like a battering ram. The surprised policeman staggered backward and fell onto the deck, whereupon Hoxworth began kicking viciously at his face, but remembering, from the pain in his bare feet as they crashed into the man’s head, that he wore no shoes, he quickly grabbed a belaying pin and started to thrash the fallen islander, thundering solid blows onto the man’s head and crotch, until the policeman fainted. Still Hoxworth continued hammering him until sounds from other parts of the deck called him to activity there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Brandishing his brutal pin, he whipped about to help Mister Wilson, who was having a bad time with a large policeman until Captain Hoxworth brought down with all the force in his bare arms the rugged belaying pin across the man’s skull. The big islander fell instantly and Hoxworth instinctively kicked him in the face, then set off for the third officer, but this man, having witnessed Hoxworth’s savage attacks upon his mates, prudently abandoned the battle and leaped into the bay. With a well-directed throw, Hoxworth spun the belaying pin through the air and caught the man in the face, cutting open a huge gash across his forehead. At once the man sank below the waves, leaving a patch of purple where he had gone down, and one of Hoxworth’s sailors shouted, “He’s drowning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let the bastard drown!” Hoxworth shouted violently. “And let these swine join him.” Alone he picked up the first unconscious victim, strained as the man’s feet slowly cleared the railing, and then with a mighty heave tossed the policeman toward the general direction of the first, who had now dazedly regained the surface in time to help his battered and inert companion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Hoxworth grabbed the feet of the third policeman and Mister Wilson the hands, and with a one-two-three prepared to toss him overboard, but one of the man’s hands was bloody, and on the three count, Mister Wilson lost his grip, so that when Hoxworth threw the legs mightily over the railing, the first mate failed to do so with the hands, and the policeman’s face struck the wood with great force, breaking his jaw and cheekbones before he pitched into the bay. There he floated for a moment, then dropped slowly to the bottom, from which he was recovered a day later.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m afraid he’s drowned,” Mister Wilson said apprehensively.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let him drown,” Hoxworth growled, licking his damaged lip. Then, grabbing a horn, he shouted ashore, “Don’t anybody try to board this ship . . . now or ever.” Tossing the horn to his mate, he brushed off his sweating chest, stamped his bare feet to knock away the pain and growled at Mister Wilson, “I was disgusted with your performance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I stood them off, one after the other,” the mate protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You fought all right,” Hoxworth admitted grudgingly, “but you had stout shoes on, and when I had the bastards down you didn’t kick them in the face.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It didn’t occur to me . . .” Mister Wilson began apologetically.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly, furiously, Captain Hoxworth grabbed his mate by the jacket. “When you fight a man aboard ship, and he knows he’s licked, always kick him in the face. Because forever after, when he looks in a mirror, he’ll have to remember. If you let him go without scarring him, sooner or later he begins to think: ‘Hoxworth wasn’t so dangerous. Next time I’ll thrash him.’ But if he constantly sees the memory of solid leather across his jawbone he can’t fool himself.” Seeing that his mate was shaken by this advice, he pushed him away and added coldly, “Keeping control of a ship is difficult duty, Mister Wilson, and until you nerve yourself to it, you’ll never be a captain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abruptly, he swung himself down the after ladder, shouting, “This time I don’t want to be disturbed.” And he rejoined Pupali’s daughters.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ashore there was consternation. On the one hand, Kelolo was appalled that Americans would dare to kill one of his policemen in sight of the entire community, and he hurried to Malama to ask her what ought to be done. She was suffering from major ills and lay back on the floor, wheezing in the day’s heat, but when she heard Kelolo’s ominous report she called her attendants and with real effort rose and dressed. Then, with her two ladies-in-waiting, she went into the town, and after assembling all available policemen, she proceeded to the pier.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the other hand, the various ships’ captains who had been chafing futilely against the new laws saw in Hoxworth’s bold action a chance to re-establish their control over Lahaina and to restore the good old days. Accordingly, they too assembled at the pier and passed the word to their men: “If they try to arrest Captain Hoxworth, we’ll all fight.” And as the sailors gathered, they armed themselves with stones and where possible with substantial clubs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama pointed to the Carthaginian and said quietly, “Kelolo, arrest that captain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Obediently, though with some apprehension, Kelolo adjusted his policeman’s cap, picked three unwilling helpers, tested his two muskets, and set out for the whaler, but he had gone less than half the distance when Captain Hoxworth, alerted by Mister Wilson, rushed on deck with a brace of pistols and began firing madly at the row-boat.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t you come a foot nearer!” he shouted, reloading and blazing away again. This time the bullets struck perilously close to the boat, and Kelolo did not have to order his men to cease rowing. They did so automatically, stared at the infuriated captain, then quickly retreated. To the surprise of all the watchers, and to the cheers of the sailors, Captain Hoxworth unexpectedly, perhaps even to himself, now swung barefooted over the side of the Carthaginian, one revolver in his left hand, one jammed into the belt of his trousers, and started rowing furiously ashore. The other sea captains formed a reception committee both to welcome and protect him. Before he had touched shore he was shouting, “Captain Henderson! Is that a cannon I see on the Bay Tree?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is. I’m headin’ for China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Got any balls?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Content, Hoxworth leaped ashore and strode up to Kelolo. Then seeing Malama in the background, he thrust the police chief aside and stormed over to the Alii Nui. “Ma’am!” he growled. “There’s not goin’ to be any more interference with the whalers in this port.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The new laws have been announced,” Malama said stoutly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The new laws be goddamned,” Hoxworth stormed. The sailors cheered, so he left Malama abruptly and advised them, “Do any goddamned thing you like!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The whaling captains applauded and one cried, “Can we bring whiskey ashore?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whiskey, girls, any damned thing you want,” Hoxworth roared. Then, seeing Kelolo’s two assistants who carried the muskets, he rushed over, ripped the arms from them and fired twice into the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment the crowd separated and onto the pier stepped Abner Hale, dressed formally in claw-hammer and top hat but still limping slightly from his old wound received at the hands of the blusterer who now threatened Lahaina’s peace. Kelolo drew back, as did the bewildered policemen whose arms had been taken from them. “Good morning, Captain Hoxworth,” Abner said.</p>

  <p class="normal">The violent whaler stepped back, looked at the little missionary and laughed. “I threw this miserable little bastard to the sharks once. I’ll do it again,” he roared, and the captains, all of whom despised Abner as the author of the sumptuary laws, shouted encouragement.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will send the girl Iliki back to school,” Abner said forcefully. The two men stared at each other for a long moment, and then almost unconsciously Captain Hoxworth’s real intention in coming to Lahaina manifested itself. He wanted to see Jerusha Bromley. Desperately, driven by powerful memories and dreams of revenge, he wanted to see this brown-haired girl. He lowered his pistols, jammed them back into his pants, and said, “We can talk better at your house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Shall we bring the whiskey ashore?” one of the captains shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course!” Hoxworth snapped. “There are no laws.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll meet at Murphy’s!” the captains yelled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is your house?” Hoxworth asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There,” said Abner, pointing past the taro patch.</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment Captain Hoxworth stared aghast, and in his incredulity Abner perceived for the first time the really miserable hovel in which he and Jerusha lived. “Does Jerusha live there?” Hoxworth gasped, staring at the low grass roof, the rain-tattered walls and the Dutch doorway.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Jesus Christ Almighty, man!” Hoxworth ejaculated. “What’s the matter with you?” With huge strides the barefooted, bare-chested captain strode up the dusty road, kicked open the wooden gate in the high wall, and brushed into the grass house. Standing on the earthen floor he adjusted his eyes to the darkness, and finally saw, in the doorway that separated the children’s quarters from Abner’s study, the girl he had wanted to marry. He looked a long time, at the tired face, the hair not quite tended, the red hands. He saw the cast-off dress that did not fit, and the coarse shoes also secondhand, a size too large and scuffed from long years in the dust. Possibly because of the darkness, possibly because he did not wish to recognize such things, he did not see the persuasive radiance that shone from Jerusha’s tired eyes nor did he sense the peace that encompassed her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My God, Jerusha! What has he done to you?” The harsh voice caused one of the children to whimper, and Jerusha left the doorway for a moment, but she soon returned and said, “Sit down, Captain Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where, for Christ’s sake?” Hoxworth stormed, beside himself with anger and bitterness. “On a box? At a table like this?” With extreme violence he smashed at Abner’s rickety table, sending the Bible translations into the wind. “Where could I sit down if I wanted to? Jerusha, do you call this a home?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the self-possessed woman replied, “I call this my temple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The answer was so final, and implied so much, that Hoxworth set adrift his first fleet of compassionate thoughts and established in their place an overpowering desire to hurt Jerusha and her husband. Kicking at the fallen table he laughed, “So this is the senate from which the laws are handed down?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner said cautiously, recovering the fallen Bible, “this Book is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you’re going to rule Lahaina by the Ten Commandments?” Hoxworth asked with a hysterical laugh.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As we rule ourselves,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again Hoxworth kicked at the table, bruising his foot as he did so. “Does the Bible direct you to live like hogs? Does it say you have to work your wife like a slave?” Impulsively, he grabbed Jerusha’s hand and held it aloft, as if he were selling her, but patiently she withdrew it and straightened her dress.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her action infuriated Hoxworth and he backed away from the missionaries, lashing them horribly with insulting words, towering oaths and threats which he had the capacity to enforce. “All right, you goddamned sniveling little worms. You can pass the laws, but you can’t make the fleet keep them. Reverend Hale, there’s going to be women aboard those whalers by noon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The women will not be allowed to go,” Abner said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My men have been at sea for nine months,” Hoxworth said. “And when they reach shore they’re going to have women. All the goddamned black-assed Hawaiian women they want. Me. I always have two. One fat one and one skinny one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you go to the church, Jerusha?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’ll stay here!” Hoxworth shouted, grabbing her once more by the hand. “Let her hear how a real man lives.” He had a consuming desire to abuse her mind with ugly pictures, to humiliate her. “Now when I get hold of a fat one and a skinny one, ma’am, I like to lock the door for about two days and I undress completely --that’s why you find me only in pants; I was interrupted and had to kill a man--and when I’m undressed I like to throw myself back on the bed and say to the girls, ‘All right, the first one of you who can . . .’” His explanation was halted by a stinging blow from Abner’s open palm against his bruised lip.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped in astonishment, then thrust out his big right arm and caught Abner by the wrist. Turning it until the missionary had to kneel in the dust of his own home, Hoxworth retained his hold on Jerusha and finished. “I tell the two girls that the first one who can make me get hard can climb aboard, and when she does the other one has to blow on me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha kneeled in the dust beside her husband, and Rafer Hoxworth looked down with contempt at the two miserable creatures. “What’re you doing, Jerusha?” he tormented. “Tending your little man?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am praying for you,” Jerusha said, in the dust. Impetuously, Hoxworth threw them both across the room and then stood over them, threateningly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s a cannon aboard the Bay Tree, and by the guts of God, if there is any interference with the whaling fleet, I’ll blow this house to pieces.” He started for the open door but felt compelled to turn and laugh at the fallen missionaries. “You’ll be interested to know that or all Pupali’s daughters the young one, Iliki, is the best. Iliki … the Pelting Spray of the Sea! I started with Pupali’s wife and worked my way right through his girls, but Iliki is my choice. And do you know why? Because you taught her such nice manners. Here at the mission. When she climbs on top of me she says, ‘Please.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he left, the two missionaries remained on their knees for some minutes, praying, and then Jerusha helped her husband rebuild the rickety table and collect his manuscript. Realizing that Captain Hoxworth meant his threats about the cannon, she took her two children over to Amanda Whipple’s, but did not divulge the scenes that had taken place at the mission. Then she returned to Abner, desiring to be with him if further trouble developed.</p>

  <p class="normal">It did. The general whaling fleet saw in Hoxworth’s bold defiance a chance to abolish forever the restrictive laws, and they coursed through Lahaina tearing, raping and destroying. They drove policemen into hiding and then congregated at the new fort, where Kelolo and a last group of trusted subordinates were determined to make a stand.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rip down the fort!” sailors who had been jailed there shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t come any closer!” Kelolo warned. But before he took action, he climbed down from the frail ramparts and asked Malama what she thought he ought to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you think is wisest?” Malama, breathing heavily, countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think we must defy them,” Kelolo said gravely. “We have started good laws, and we must not surrender them now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I agree,” Malama said, “but I do not want you to get hurt, my dear husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Kelolo smiled warmly at her use of this unexpected term, for he knew that she had been forbidden by the missionaries to use it in respect to him. “Do you feel better now?” he asked solicitously, as if he were a courtier and not a husband.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel very ill, Kelolo. Do you think they will fire the cannon? I should not like to hear the noise of such a great gun.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think they will fire,” Kelolo said. “And then they will be ashamed of themselves. And after a while they will stop.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think they will kill anyone?” Malama asked fearfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kelolo, I hope above all else that they do not kill you. There could be no finer husband than you have been to me.” The enormous woman tried to find an easy position and then asked, “Did they harm the missionaries?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don t know,” Kelolo said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Isn’t it strange?” Malama asked. “The little man spends so much time telling us how the Hawaiians ought to behave, but it is always his people who do the wrong things.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was fighting at the gate and Kelolo was called away to make decisions. He told his men not to fire their few guns, lest a hopeless riot be initiated, but he did encourage them to use poles to push away the ribald attackers, so that from the Bay Tree Captain Hoxworth could see through his glass some of his own men from the Carthaginian being knocked off the walls, at which he grew agitated beyond control, and personally wheeled the cannon into position, ordering a charge to be fired. The forty-pound ball whistled through the palm trees near the fort and he shouted, “Down twenty feet!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The next ball crashed into the fort and threw bits of rock high into the air. The third ball struck the gate area and demolished it, so that hundreds of sailors were free to storm inside, where they elbowed Kelolo aside and threatened Malama.</p>

  <p class="normal">“See that missionary house?” Hoxworth shouted, elated at his success with the cannon. “Up there to the left. Smash it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the first ball was high, and Hoxworth danced barefooted with excitement as he directed the sights lowered. The fifth shot of the day tore completely through the mission house, as did the sixth and seventh. “By God,” the captain screamed, “that’ll end the laws!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, as if he had been struck by some terrible unseen hand, he clasped his breast, cursed at the gunners and knocked them about like stones in a child’s game. “Goddamn you!” he screamed. “What are you doing?” And leaping into the bay, he swam furiously ashore. Dripping wet he rushed past the breached fort, where sailors were abusing the chief of police and the fat woman, and onto the mission grounds, where the splintered wood from the shattered grass house appalled him. Bursting into the room he had visited only shortly before, he cried in anguish, “Jerusha! Are you hurt?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not find her and started looking under the fallen beams-- frail bits of wood hauled patiently from the mountains--and then from the inner room he heard sounds, and he smashed open the niggardly woven door and saw Jerusha and her husband praying in the dust of their destroyed home. “Oh, thank God!” he yelled with joy, grabbing Jerusha to his bare and salty body. She did not resist, but passively looked at him with horror which was heightened when she saw that her husband was approaching him with a broken knife.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” she found strength to scream. “God will do it, Abner!” And with relief such as she had never known before in her life, not even when Abner alone and sweating had delivered her first baby, she saw her husband drop his arm. Quickly, Captain Hoxworth wheeled about, saw the knife, and smashed his fist into Abner’s pale face. The little man doubled up and flew backwards against the grass wall and through its weakened portion. From inside the room he could hear his wife struggling with the sea captain. Before he could regain his feet he heard her screams and then the captain’s cry of rage as she bit into the great salty hand. By the time he could get back into the room, brandishing a club, he saw Hoxworth standing at the front door, what was left of it, sucking his fiercely bitten hand. And then, as if nothing had happened, the huge sea captain said sorrowfully, “It is a dreadful place that your husband has brought you to, Jerusha. When did you last have a new dress?” He started to go, then added almost in tears, “Why is it that we always meet when you are pregnant … by this goddamned fool?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The rioting continued for three more days, and girls who had been well along in Jerusha’s school, standing midway between the savage and the civilized, reverted to the insane joy of sleeping, six and eight and ten at a time, in the hot foc’s’ls of the whaling ships. Murphy’s grog shop rollicked with songs. Old men who tried to keep sailors out of their homes were beaten up, and their daughters taken. And at the palace, tired, bewildered Malama ordered all women to the hills and found it increasingly difficult to breathe.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was on the third day of the riots that she summoned Abner and asked with difficulty, “How did these things happen, my dear teacher?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are all animals, Malama,” he explained. “Only the laws of God keep us within the confines of decency.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why have your men not learned those laws?” Malama asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because Lahaina has itself been so long without the law. Wherever there is no law, men think they can do as they will.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If your king knew about these days … the cannon and the burning of the houses . . . would he apologize?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He would be humiliated,” Abner affirmed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why is it that the Americans and the English and the French are so determined that we sell whiskey in our stores . . . and allow our girls to go to their ships?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is because Hawaii has not yet established herself as a civilized nation,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are your men civilizing us?” Malama asked wearily. “By firing the cannon at us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am ashamed for our men,” Abner said in despair.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the moment Malama had been waiting for, and after a long pause she said softly, “Now we are equal, Makua Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In what way?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have always told me that I could not achieve a state of grace without humility, without admitting to God that I am lost and totally evil. You would not accept me into your church because you claimed I was not humble. Makua Hale, I will tell you something. I wasn’t humble. And you were right to keep me out of your church. But do you know why I could not be humble?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why?” Abner asked carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because you were not humble. Your ways were always right. Mine were always wrong. Your words were always white. Mine were black. You tried to make me speak Hawaiian because you wanted to learn Hawaiian, and I would not beg to join your church, because you spoke of humility but knew it not. Today, Makua Hale, with the fort destroyed and your home knocked down by your own people, we are equal. I am humble at last. I am unable to act without God’s help. And for the first time I see before me a humble man.” The great huge woman began to weep, and after a moment she rose painfully to her knees, pushing aside her sorrowful attendants and making a prayer-temple of her hands. From that position she said in total contrition, “I am lost, Makua Hale, and I beg you to accept me into your church. I am going to die and I want to speak with God before I do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the Bay Tree some fools were firing the cannon again at the house of a man and wife who would not give them their daughter, and at the western end of town a building was ablaze. There was a dance under way at Murphy’s, and three of Pupali’s daughters were in Captain Hoxworth’s cabin. It was under these conditions that Abner said, “We will baptize you into the church of God, Malama. We will do it on Sunday.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We had better do it now,” Malama suggested, and one of the waiting-women nodded, so Abner sent for Jerusha, Keoki, Noelani, Kelolo, Captain Janders and the Whipples. They came through the rioters, who jeered at Janders for not being a real sea captain and at the Whipples for being missionaries, but when Dr. Whipple saw Malama he was greatly concerned and said, “This woman is very ill,” at which huge Kelolo began to sob.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a mournful crowd that formed a semicircle around Malama, who lay flat on the floor, wheezing painfully. The cannon sounded in the distance, and half a hundred hoodlums who had trailed the Whipples jeered outside the palace gates. Without a Bible, Abner recited from memory the closing passages of Proverbs, and the words had a special application to Malama, the Alii Nui: ” ‘Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he announced to the gathering: “Malama Kanakoa, daughter of the King of Kona, having entered into a state of grace, seeks baptism into the holy church of God. Is it your wish that she be accepted?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Keoki spoke first, then Janders and the Whipples, but when it came time for Jerusha, who in the last days had appreciated for the first time the courage Malama had shown in governing Maui, she did not speak but bowed and kissed the sick woman. “You are my daughter,” Malama said weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner interrupted and said, “Malama, you will now put aside your heathen name and take a Christian one. Which do you wish?”</p>

  <p class="normal">A look of supreme joy came over the sick woman’s massive face and she whispered, “I should like the name of that dear friend of whom Jerusha has often told me. My name will be Luka. Jerusha, will you tell me the story for the last time?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as if she were talking to her own children at dusk, Jerusha began once more the story of Ruth—Luka to the Hawaiians—and when she came to the part about the alien land she broke down and was unable to continue, so Malama concluded the story, adding, “May I like Luka find happiness in the new land to which I shall soon go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">After the baptism, Whipple suggested, “You’d better leave now. I have to examine Malama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll die with the old medicines, Doctor,” Malama said simply, and she indicated to Kelolo that he must now bring in the kahunas.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are kahunas proper, when we have just . . .” Abner began, but Jerusha pulled him away, and the little procession marched back to the center of town, where Amanda Whipple suggested, “You had better stay with us, Jerusha and Abner.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will stay in our house,” Jerusha said firmly, and when they were there, after the riotings had subsided and the ship captains were beginning to feel ashamed of themselves, for natives were whispering that sailors at the fort had killed Malama, or had caused her near-death, Captain Rafer Hoxworth, fully dressed, with polished cap and buttons, came up the pathway to the mission house, followed by five sailors with armloads of gifts.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tucking his hat under his arm, as he had long ago been taught to do when addressing a lady, he said gruffly, “I apologize, ma’am. If I have broken anything I want to replace it. The other captains have contributed these chairs and this table . . .” He paused in some embarrassment and then added, “And I’ve gone among the ships and got this cloth. I trust you’ll make yourself some decent … I mean some new dresses, ma’am.” He bowed, placed his hat on his head, and left the mission grounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Abner was intent upon demolishing the furniture. “We’ll burn it on the pier,” he threatened, but Jerusha would not permit this.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It has been sent to us as an act of retribution,” she said firmly. “We have always needed chairs and a desk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you think that I could translate the Bible … on that desk?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Captain Hoxworth did not send it,” Jerusha replied, and while her husband watched, she started arranging the chairs in the damaged room. “God has sent these things to the mission,” she said, “and not to Abner and Jerusha Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll give the cloth to Malama’s women,” Abner insisted, and to this Jerusha agreed, but when he was gone, and the town was once more quiet, she sat in one of the new chairs at her new kitchen table and composed this letter:</p>

  <p class="normal">“My dearest Sister Esther in God. You alone of all the people I know will have the grace to forgive me for what I am about to do. It is an act of vanity and one, under the circumstances of my life, truly unforgivable, but if it is sinful, it must rest on me alone, and I am powerless to avoid it. Dearest sister, do not smile at me and above all tell no one of my vanity.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You have often asked me if there might be some small thing that you could send me, and I have always replied that God provided for my dear husband and me, and that is the truth. The mission board has sent us all that we require, but lately, as I grow older, I realize with some dismay that it has been many years since I have worn a dress that was made particularly for me. Quickly I must add that those which they send us from the charity barrels are good, and in fine style, but I find myself desiring just once more a dress of my own.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I should like it to be russet in color, with either blue or red trimming, and I would be especially grateful to you if it could have the full round sleeves that seem to be in popular style today. I saw such a dress some years ago on a woman heading for Honolulu, and I thought it very becoming. But if the styles have changed substantially, and if there is now a fashion that I do not know of, I would rather wish you to follow the newer style. Hats I do not need, but if you could find it in your heart to send me a pair of gloves, with lace as in the old days, I should be most deeply appreciative.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do not need to tell you, dearest Esther, that I have no money wherewith to pay you for this extraordinary request, for I have not seen a dollar in over seven years and do not require to see any; and I appreciate that this is a vain and costly imposition to place upon a friend. But I pray that you will understand.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am not as stout as I used to be, and seem not to be as tall, so do not make the dress too large. I would judge from what your dear brother tells me that I am now about your size, but I do not want one of your dresses or anybody’s. The cloth must be wholly new and mine. And may you find the charity in your heart to forgive me for this begging letter. Your sister, Jerusha.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When she went to Janders &amp; Whipple’s store to post the letter she discovered that the Carthaginian had sailed and that lovely Iliki, Pupali’s youngest, had joined the captain. She felt sorrier for this than for anything that had happened in the past days, and she could not refrain from tears. “She was an adorable child,” Jerusha said mournfully. “We shall not find another like her. Already I feel her departure as a great loss, for I had come to think of her as my own daughter. I do hope the world is good to Iliki.” And she tried to dry her eyes, but the tears would not cease.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ONE</span> OF <span>THE LAST PUBLIC ACTS</span> Malama performed was to climb into her land canoe, adjusting herself painfully on piles of tapa and directing her bearers to carry her through the damaged streets. Wherever she went she said simply, “The laws we gave are good laws. They must be obeyed.” She stopped to encourage policemen, and at Murphy’s grog shop again announced, in short gasps:</p>

  <p class="normal">“No more alcohol may be sold to Hawaiians. Girls must stop dancing here undressed.” And the force of her words, coming as it did so soon after the riots, was four times what it had been before, and gradually Kelolo’s policemen retrieved the control they had lost, and gained more besides. In her ludicrous canoe, followed by her two enormous ladies-in-waiting and the men with feathered staves, Malama became a figure of considerable dignity.</p>

  <p class="normal">Both Abner and Jerusha noticed that on this strange canoe journey Malama’s children, Keoki and Noelani, were drawn closely to her, and at the fort, where the largest congregation had assembled, Malama went so far as to announce: “I am going to die. My daughter Noelani will be the Alii Nui.” There was no applause, but the citizens studied the handsome young girl with increased respect.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner now observed that the important kahunas of the island were gathering about Malama and arguing with her fervently, and he assumed that -they were trying to cajole their renegade leader into abandoning her new religion, but this was not the case. The kahunas were satisfied with Christianity and were willing to acknowledge that its god was patently superior to their own, so prudence alone directed them to respect the potent newcomer; but they were also eager to overlook nothing in protecting their calm and massive alii in her last days, so as Abner prayed to Jehovah, they silently prayed to Kane. They massaged Malama with special care, sought traditional herbs to soothe her, and prepared favorite foods, on which she continued to gorge, feeling that only in this way had she any chance of recovering her strength. She ate four times a day, and sometimes five, and at a normal meal consumed a pound or two of roast pig, part of a dog, some baked fish, a substantial helping of breadfruit and not less than a quart of poi and oftentimes two or three, after which the lomilomi women would knead her stomach to spur her faltering digestion. Dr. Whipple stormed: “She’s eating herself to death, but she started doing so when she was twenty. Such fantastic meals!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When word reached the other islands that Malama, daughter of the King of Kona, was dying, the alii assembled, as they had at deathbeds for untold generations, and in after years whenever an American who had been in Lahaina at the time was asked for his most vivid impression of the island, he never referred to the cannonading but to this last mournful gathering of the alii: “They came from distant Kauai in ships and from Lanai in canoes. They came singly and in groups. Some came in western clothes, I recall, and some in yellow capes. But they all landed at our little pier, walked gravely past Kamehameha’s old palace and eastward along the dusty road beneath the kou trees. I can see them now. What giants they were!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Queen Kaahumanu, regent of the islands, came attended by Queens Liliha and Kinau, both of enormous girth. From Hawaii came Princess Kalani-o-mai-heu-ila, heavier by forty pounds than Malama, and from Honolulu, Kauikeaouli, the boy king. The great men of the islands were there: Paki and Bold and Hoapili and the leader called by westerners Billy Pitt; and Dr. Whipple, seeing them assemble, thought: “In one lifetime they lifted their islands from paganism to God, from the Stone Age to the modern. And to do so they had to fight off the Russians, the English, the French, the Germans and the Americans. Every time a civilized warship came to their islands it was to make them turn over girls for the sailors or rum to the natives.” They were an amazing race, the old alii of Hawaii, and now as they gathered in formal panoply for the death of Luka Malama Kanakoa they seemed to be mourning for themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple observed to Abner: “They are like echoes of the great animals that once roamed the world and marched slowly to their death as changes overtook them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What animals?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The monstrous ones before the ice ages,” Whipple explained. “Some scientists think they vanished because they became too huge to be accommodated on the changing earth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have no interest in such speculation,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">In her grass palace Malama greeted each of the great old friends. “Aloha nui nui,” she repeated constantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe, auwe!” they wept. “We have come to weep with our beloved sister.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When extreme pain in breathing attacked her, she bit her lower lip and gasped through the corners of her big mouth, resuming her smile as soon as the pain passed, while around her, in a vast semicircle, hunched the alii, whispering to themselves and praying.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Kelolo decided that it was time to move the woman he had loved so deeply onto the bed where she would die, so he sent his men to the hills to fetch bundles of fragrant leaves—api for protection against evil spirits, ti for healing, and mysterious maile whose penetrating aroma was the best loved—and when these leaves arrived, redolent and reminiscent of courtship days on Hawaii, Kelolo gently broke the back of each one so as to release its odor, and he arranged them in a formal pattern over the tapa blanket. Over this fragrant bed he placed a softly woven pandanus mat, and then a soft tapa, and over all a sheet of Cantonese silk embroidered with golden dragons. And whenever giant Malama moved on this bed, she caught the smell of maile.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next, Kelolo went to the beach and had his fishermen procure fresh aholehole, which in the old custom of the islands he cooked himself. He grated coconuts and saw to the baking of breadfruit, and in her last days she ate not a morsel except from his fingers. In the long hours of the night it was he who waved the soft feathered wands to keep away the flies from the great sleeping body that he had loved so well, and he never approached her except on his hands and knees, for he wished to remind her that she was the Alii Nui, the one from whom his mana came. But what pleased her most was the morning, when Kelolo would leave her for a while and then come creeping back to her on his elbows, for his arms would be filled with red lehua blossoms and ginger and yellow hau. He brought them to her with dew still upon them, as he had done years ago, before the clashing battles of Kamehameha had interrupted their lives.</p>

  <p class="normal">She died looking at Kelolo, seeing him as he had been in their youth, before strange gods and missionaries had intervened between them, but her last words reflected the new society which she had been instrumental in launching: “When I die no one must knock out his teeth. No one must blind his eye. There must be no furious lamenting. I shall be buried as a Christian.” Then she summoned Kelolo and whispered to him for the last time, raising herself upon her elbow to do so, so that when she expired she fell backwards, a mighty surge of lifeless flesh, crushing the maile leaves.</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama’s wish was granted, and she was accorded a Christian burial in a cedar box on an island in the center of a marshy area where the alii had often gone on outings. Abner preached a moving graveside sermon, and the towering alii, standing beside the first Christian grave that many of them had ever seen, thought: “This is a better way to bury a woman than the old way,” but the common people, not allowed onto the kapu island, stood on the shores of the river and wept piteously in the old fashion. None of them, however, knocked out their teeth or gouged their living eyeballs as they had done in the past when an alii nui died. Instead they watched in awe as the funeral procession formed: Makua Hale and his wife in front, intoning prayers for their beloved friend, followed by Captain Janders and Dr. Whipple and their wives. Then came the kahunas wreathed in maile and secretly muttering old heathen chants to themselves, followed by the towering alii, weeping in massive grief. Eight of the men, wearing yellow capes, carried poles on which was placed the cedar box. It was covered with maile and lehua blossoms and by a huge silken coverlet embroidered in purple dragons.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the silent mourners reached the actual grave, the alii began to cry, “Auwe, auwe for our eldest sister.” And the noise became so pitiful that Abner, attending to the Christian burial that was to expel heathen rituals, failed to observe that Kelolo, Keoki and Noelani did not approach the grave, but remained apart, conspiring with the major kahunas. What Kelolo confided was this: “When Malama whispered to me at her death she said, ‘Let them bury me in the new way. It will help Hawaii. But when the missionary is finished, do not let my bones be found.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">The plotters stared at each other gravely, and as Abner commenced his long prayer an old kahuna whispered, “It is right that we should respect the new religion, but it would be a shameful thing to the house of Kanakoa if her bones were found.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Another whispered, “When Kamehameha the Great died he gave those same instructions to Hoapili, and at night Hoapili crept away with his bones, and to this day no man knows where they are hidden. That is the way of an alii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And while Abner pleaded, “Lord, take Thy daughter Malama!” the oldest kahuna whispered hoarsely to Kelolo, “Such a deathbed wish is binding above all others. You know what you must do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the grave the three missionary couples raised their harmonious voices in “Blest be the tie that binds,” while each member of Kelolo’s mysterious group whispered in turn, “It is your duty, Kelolo,” but no such confirmation was really necessary, for from the moment Malama had whispered to her husband, he had realized what he must do. Therefore, when the singing at the graveside ended and Abner led the congregation in final prayer, Kelolo prayed: “Kane, guide us in the right way. Help us, help us.” And the first Christian burial in Lahaina ended.</p>

  <p class="normal">But as the funeral procession returned to the boats, Kelolo gently held his son’s hand and whispered, “I would be happy, Keoki, if you would stay.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This was an invitation which the young man had anticipated, even though he had hoped to escape it. Now that it had come, he accepted and said, “I will help you.” In this quiet manner, his appalling decision was made.</p>

  <p class="normal">For some time he had sensed that a trap was closing about him, for he had been unable to hide from his father and the kahunas his bitter disappointment over Reverend Kale’s refusal to accept him as a minister, a resentment which deepened when both Dr. Whipple and Abraham Hewlett quit the calling, proving that from the start they had had less dedication to God than he. The kahunas had whispered, “The missionaries will never allow a Hawaiian to join them.” On the other hand, from the moment of his conversion in the snow outside Yale College, he had been totally committed to God and still stood willing to suffer the humiliation of seeing men with less vocation than he admitted to the ministry. He loved God, knew Him personally, spoke with Him at sunset. He was willing to devote his entire life to God’s desires and he was ashamed of himself for having wondered, “Why should I remain faithful if the missionaries reject me because I am Hawaiian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a curious way he had been content with his ambivalent position of loving God while hating His missionaries, for so long as he remained in that delicate balance he could escape making definite choices; but with the death of his great mother he had been subtly drawn by both Kelolo and the kahunas to a fundamental reconsideration of his beliefs. The cannonading of Lahaina and its debauch by Christian Americans had already pushed him to a stark question: “Is this new religion good for my people?” Now, on the evening of his mother’s burial, as the pagan sun sank behind the fawn-colored hills of Lanai, lighting the sea roads with shimmering gold as it had in the days before Captain Cook, Keoki made his choice between the religions. “I will help you,” he told his father.</p>

  <p class="normal">When darkness fell, Kelolo, Keoki and two strong young kahunas proceeded to the fresh grave of their Alii Nui and carefully lifted aside the flower leis that covered it. Then they produced digging sticks which had been hidden earlier that day, and they uncovered the cedar box, pried away the top and reverently lifted out the black Bible that lay on top. Then they saw once more, wreathed in maile, their great alii. Gently they rolled the vast inert body onto a canvas sling and returned to repair the grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will cut the banana trunk,” Kelolo directed, and Keoki went to the center of the island and cut down a leafy trunk which from time out of mind had represented man to the gods, and when he had a length as tall as Malama, he returned to the coffin, and it was placed inside, lest the Lord God Jehovah be angry, and the Bible was put in place, and the grave was resealed, with the flowered leis scattered upon it. Then the four strong men lifted the canvas and carried Malama to her true burial.</p>

  <p class="normal">In darkest night they rowed to the shore where none could see them, then started a mournful march toward the hills of Maui. Toward morning they reached a secluded valley, where as soon as light came they dug a shallow grave and filled its bottom with porous rocks, upon which they placed banana leaves and ti. When all was ready, they tenderly put Malama into the grave, covering her with a sacred tapa and then with moist leaves and grass. Next they piled the grave high with such sticks as they could find, and lighted it. For three days they kept the fire slowly burning as the kahunas chanted:</p>

  <p class="normal">“From the heat of living to the cool waters of Kane, From the desires of earth to the cool waters of Kane, From the burdens of desire to the cool retreats of Kane, Gods of the many islands, gods of the distant seas, Gods of the Little Eyes, gods of the stars and sun, Take her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the fourth day Kelolo opened the grave whose burning heat had baked away Malama’s flesh, and with a sharp knife he severed her head from her gigantic skeleton. Carefully scraping the skull to remove all desiccated fragments, he wrapped it in maile leaves, then in tapa and finally in a closely woven pandanus mat. For so long as he lived, this would be his perpetual treasure, and as he grew older, in the evenings he would unwrap his beloved’s head and talk with her. He would recall that before the Christians came she had loved tobacco. He would light his pipe and when the smoke was good, he would blow it into her mouth, knowing that she would appreciate his thoughtfulness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next he cut away one of the huge thigh bones, and this he gave to Keoki both to scrape and to keep, and the young man proceeded with his ancient task as if voices from the past were calling him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Kelolo cut off the other leg, and scraped the thigh bone for Noelani, the Alii Nui, so that she would always have with her some reminder of the source from whence came her greatness, and when these jobs were done, Kelolo gathered the remaining bones and embers and handed them to one of the kahunas who had brought with him a curious bag of sennit, so constructed that it looked like a woman, and into this receptacle Malama’s final remains were put. The sennit bag was handed to Kelolo, and with it under his left arm and the wrapped head under his right, he started forth alone on his final pilgrimage.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked through the heat of day far up the valley from which the whistling winds sometimes came to strike Lahaina, over the saddle, along the crest of hills and on to a cave which he had discovered while gathering maile. Here he stopped and, crawling carefully inside, collected lava rocks with which he built a small platform. Here, safe from the corrupting earth, he deposited the last royal remains of his wife. Then, as in the old times, he prayed. When this was done he sat for more than an hour staring at the desolate and hidden pile of rocks.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Kane!” he suddenly screamed, repeating the anguished shout until the cave echoed and until he became hysterical with grief. He threw himself against the platform, took a fragment of rock into his lips, ground it between his teeth until his whole body was racked with ugliness and despair. Beating the stones with his fists he screamed, “Malama, I cannot leave you. I cannot.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he regained composure, he started a small fire beside the platform, then raved afresh as pungent smoke filled the cave. Grabbing a piece of bark he formed a tube which he held in the flames until it was ablaze, whereupon he jammed it against his cheek until he could feel the flesh burning in a small circle. Again and again he did this, seeking to scar his face so that all who saw him would know that he mourned the death of his alii.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, when the pain of burnt flesh was great, he grasped a pointed stick and jammed it between his two big front teeth. With a heavy rock he began to pound the opposite end, but his teeth were strong and would not break. In the quietness of the cave, with the smoke about him, he cursed his teeth and struck the stick with enormous force until he felt a horrible wrenching in his upper jaw. The bone had broken and the tooth dangled free. Clutching it with his fingers he jerked it loose and placed it upon the lava rocks, whereupon with demonic power he knocked its companion out with the stone itself, gashing his lips as he did so.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, Malama! Malama! Cherished of my heart, Malama!” In his misery he wept for some moments. Then with superhuman resolution he took the stick again and placed its dulled point next his nose and in the corner of his right eye. With a sudden inward thrust followed by a lateral pull, he scooped away his eye and threw it onto the grave. Then he fainted.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was ten days before the powerful chief Kelolo Kanakoa reappeared in Lahaina. He came walking erect, proudly, but removed, as if he were still in contact with his gods. About his shoulders he wore a lei of maile leaves, its fragrance reminding him of his departed wife. His right eye socket, a horrible wound, was covered with morning-glory leaves, bound in place by alona and ti. His cheeks were scarred with ugly blisters and his lips, when closed, were thick with wounds; when opened they disclosed a lacerated jaw. He moved like a man set free from grief, a man who walked with love, and as he passed, his Hawaiian friends, knowing what he had done, stepped aside with respect; but his American friends stopped with horror, wondering how he could have borne so much.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was important that he warn Reverend Hale, but when Jerusha saw him she screamed, but he was not offended, saying through lisping lips, “The whistling wind is coming. It always does at the death of an alii.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is the wind?” Jerusha asked, trying to compose herself, for she realized that he was speaking with great conviction.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The whistling wind is coming,” he repeated and stalked off, a man apart.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Jerusha told her husband of the message, and of Kelolo’s appearance, Abner held his head in his hands, lamenting, “These poor, bewildered people. Thank God we gave her a Christian burial.” And Jerusha agreed, saying, “We should be grateful that Malama forbade heathen practices.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They grieved for obstinate Kelolo, and finally Jerusha asked, “What was the wind he spoke about?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“One of his superstitions,” Abner explained. “He’s probably in a trance because of the horrible things he did to himself and is convinced that since an alii died, there will have to be some supernatural occurrence.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is the wind rising?” Jerusha asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No more than usual,” her husband replied, but as he spoke he heard a weird whistling coming down from the distant valleys that led to the crests of the hills where Malama, unknown to them, now lay.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner,” Jerusha insisted, “I do hear a whistling.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her husband cocked his ear, then ran out into the dusty roadway. Dr. Whipple and Captain Janders were already listening to the ominous sound, while Hawaiians were running out of their houses and huddling under trees. “What is it?” Abner cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not like anything I ever heard,” Janders replied, and the moaning whistle increased in pitch while high in the coconut palms dead branches began to tear loose. A Hawaiian sailor, who had swum in panic from one of the whalers, abandoning the ship to its fate, dashed by, wet and frightened and shouting in Hawaiian, “The whistling wind is upon us!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Should we go inside?” Abner asked hesitantly, but the same sailor yelled back over his shoulder, “No stay in house! Bimeby come plenty pilikia.” And the three Americans remarked that the Hawaiians, who seemed to know what the wind could do, had abandoned their huts Abner was already on his way to collect his children when Murphy the saloonkeeper, rushed up and shouted, “This wind is a killer! Get out of your houses!” And while the three men scattered, the first important gust of wind struck Lahaina.</p>

  <p class="normal">It bent the palm trees level, ripped off the roofs of several houses, then roared out to sea, where it threw great clouds of spume across the roads and tore away the masts of two whalers. During its destructive passage the whistling increased to an intense shriek and then subsided. Under the protection of a clump of kou trees Janders asked, “Where’s the rain?”</p>

  <p class="normal">None came, but the wind howled down from the mountains in new gusts, knocking down trees and throwing pigs into ditches. From the little stream before the mission house it picked up water, flinging it upon the trees, then passed out to sea, where it dashed three moored whalers together, staving in the sides of one and leaving it in perilous condition.</p>

  <p class="normal">Still no rain came, but the winds increased, rising to even more furious levels than before, and now it became evident why the Hawaiians had left their homes, for one after another the little huts went flying through the air, crashing into the first solid object that intervened. “Will these trees hold?” Abner asked anxiously, but before anyone could assure him he saw a dark object hurtling through the air and cried, “The church!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the roof,” Whipple shouted, astonished at what he saw. “It’s the entire roof!” Majestically, the roof sailed over the town of Lahaina and plunged into the sea. “The walls are going down!” Whip-pie cried as the wind utterly destroyed the building.</p>

  <p class="normal">But before Abner could lament his new loss, a woman shrieked, “The whaling boats are sinking!” And she was correct, for in the roads the demonic wind, still with no rain, had whipped up a sea that the rugged whalers could not survive. The unfortunate ones were those who were torn loose from their anchorages and dashed across the roads to the island of Lanai, on whose steep and rocky shores no rescue was possible. In that manner four ships and seventy men perished, and as they died, the Hawaiians of Lahaina mourned, “They are the sacrifices for the death of our Alii Nui.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, the sailors whose ships capsized off Lahaina would also have perished at the feet of the fatalistic Hawaiians had not Abner Hale limped among them, shouting, “Save those poor men! Save them!” But the Hawaiians repeated, “They are sacrifices!” until in frenzy Abner rushed up to one-eyed Kelolo, screaming above the storm, “Tell them, Kelolo! Tell them Malama does not require sacrifices! Tell them she died a Christian!”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment’s hesitation during which the old man, weak from his vigil in the cave, looked out at the sickening sea. Then, throwing aside his tapa breechclout, he plunged into the waves and began fighting them for the bodies of sailors. Ashore Abner organized rescue parties which waded, tied together by ropes, onto the reef from which most of the water had been blown by the fantastic winds. At the end of each line swimmers like Kelolo battled the turbulent waters to haul foundering sailors across the jagged reef’s edge, delivering them into the hands of rescuers. Without the work of Kelolo and Abner, the loss of American sailors would have been not seventy but nearly three hundred.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward the end of the struggle, Abner was limping about the reef, shouting encouragement, when he received from the hands of a swimmer the already dead body of a cabin boy, and he was overcome by the ceaseless tragedy of the sea and he started to pray: ” “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.’” But his prayer was halted when he looked into the violent storm and saw that the swimmer who had handed him the boy was Kelolo, who was shouting to the other Hawaiians, “Pray to Kanaloa for strength.” And Abner could see that the swimmers were praying.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the whistling subsided, Abner sat limply beneath the kou trees, watching Dr. Whipple treat the rescued sailors, and when the doctor came to him for a rest, Abner asked, “These things couldn’t have had any connection with Malama’s death, could they?” When Whipple made no reply, he continued, “John, you’re a scientist.” From the day Whipple left the mission, Abner had never again referred to him as Brother. “How do you explain such a wind? No rain? Coming not from the sea but from the mountains?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Even while helping to rescue the whalers, Whipple had been perplexed by this problem and now suggested, “The mountains on the other side of our island must form a curious kind of funnel. I would judge there must be wide-open valleys up which the trade winds rush. When they roll over the tops of the mountains, the entire volume is compressed into this one narrow valley leading down into Lahaina.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That wouldn’t have anything to do with the death of an alii, would it?” Abner asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. We can explain the wind as it roars down this side of the mountain. We know that’s a force of nature. But of course,” he added slyly, “it’s entirely possible that the wind on the other side of the mountain blows only when an alii dies.” Shrugging his shoulders he added, “And if that’s the case, why you have just about what Kelolo claims.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner started to comment on this but instead changed the subject. “Tell me, John, how did you feel, at the very height of the storm, when you were on the reef rescuing the sailors . . . seeing the whalers that had so recently been tormenting us … well, seeing them destroyed by the Lord?” Dr. Whipple turned to study his companion, staring at him in disbelief, but Abner continued: “Didn’t you feel that it was something like . . . well, I thought it was like the Egyptians at the Red Sea.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple got up, disgusted, and called his wife, who was tending wounded sailors. “I don’t think the alii sent the wind, and I don’t think God sank the ships,” he growled and left.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he had not waited for Abner to develop the full meaning of his speculations, as they had matured on the coral reef, so Abner chased him and said, “What I wanted to ask, John, was this: ‘At that moment of what I have called God’s revenge for the cannonading, did you feel any actual sense of revenge against the sailors?’ ” “No,” Whipple said flatly. “All I thought was, ‘I hope we can save the poor devils.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought the same thing,” Abner said frankly, “and I was astonished at myself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’re growing up,” Whipple said sharply and left.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ONE UNEXPECTED BENEFIT</span> came from the whistling wind that leveled much of Lahaina in 1829. When the damage was cleared away, Kelolo for the third time helped Abner rebuild his church, but this time the kahunas refused even to argue where the door should be. They put it where it should have been in the first place, where the local gods ordained, and the famous stone church they built that year stood for more than a century.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now Lahaina, most beautiful of all Hawaiian towns, prospered as the national capital. The business center of the kingdom was Honolulu, to be sure, for foreigners preferred living near their consulates, but the alii had never liked Honolulu, finding it hot, cheerless and commonplace, so that even though it was true that the boy king and his regents had to spend more and more time there, he returned whenever possible to his true capital, Lahaina, and his women often remained in the cool grass houses under the kou trees even when he was called to the larger city.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whaling vessels, their crews now better behaved, came to Lahaina in increasing numbers—78 would come in 1831, 82 in 1833—and because each stayed for about four weeks in the spring and four in the autumn, there were sometimes many tall-masted ships in the roads; and since the famous whistling wind of Lahaina blew only about twice a century, they rested in security within the charmed pocket of islands. The important thing to Janders &amp; Whipple was that every whaler who came into the roads paid them a fee for something or other. Did the ship need firewood? J &amp; W had it. Salt pork? Dr. Whipple found out how to salt down island hogs. Salt itself? J &amp; W had a monopoly on the fine salt evaporated from the sea in flat lava-rock beds. Did a ship’s captain insist upon fresh pork at sea? J &amp; W could provide healthy live pigs and bundles of ti leaves for fodder on long trips. Sweet potatoes, oranges that had been introduced by Captain Cook, and fish dried by Dr. Whipple . . . J &amp; W had them all. And if a ship required balls of olona twine, strongest in the world, or even cables woven of it, J &amp; W controlled that monopoly, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was John Whipple, however, who devised one of the simplest moneymaking schemes for the firm. When a whaler put in with an unwieldy amount of whale oil, not enough barrels to warrant sailing all the way home, but so many that there seemed no purpose in returning to the Off-Japan Banks, Whipple arranged for the captain to leave his entire cargo at Lahaina, under the care of J &amp; W, who, when they had assembled half a dozen such cargoes, would argue some New England captain into running the entire lot back to New Bedford. In this way J &amp; W made a profit on storing the barrels of oil, on shipping them, and on chartering the ship that did the work. It therefore seemed to Whipple that the next logical step ought to be for his firm to buy the odd lots of oil outright and to hold them on speculation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Accordingly, he proposed that J &amp; W acquire its own ships and take over the whale-oil business, but cautious Captain Janders, tugging at his red beard, was adamant. “Only one way to make money in this world,” he judged. “My motto: ‘Own nothing, control everything.’ Own a batch of oil outright? Never! Because then you worry about the market. Let someone else own it. We’ll handle it, and we’ll make the better profit. But to own a ship. That is real madness. I’ve watched the tribulations of shipowners. They have to trust a rascally captain, a worse mate and a depraved crew. They’ve got to feed the lot, insure the vessel, live in anguish when there’s a storm, and then share whatever profits there are with the crew.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You bought the Thetis,” Whipple argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sure!” Janders agreed. “I bought her, but did you see how fast I sold her? On an earlier trip I had watched Kelolo’s mouth watering for such a ship, and I knew I could turn a quick profit. Me operate a ship on my own responsibility? Never!” And he pointed to the rotting hulk that still hung on the reef. “Whenever you want to buy a ship, John, always remember the Thetis.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Still Whipple was not satisfied, for he argued, “Somebody makes money on ships. I thought it might as well be us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Janders agreed, in part, for he said, “I grant that properly handled a ship can make a little money, but if you and I learn how to manage the business and the lands right here, John, we’ll make a fortune that will stagger the shipowners. Own nothing, control everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the fields Captain Janders had determined to control, he was a master trader, sending meat to Oregon, picking up furs for Canton-sending hides to Valparaiso and tallow to California. He made a quick profit on each exchange and was always on hand when men were in trouble, for then money was free. Gradually, the whalers found that they could trust him with any transaction, and he became their agent. If a ship’s captain wanted to risk the dying sandalwood trade having heard that Captain Janders had made his fortune on it, J &amp; W gladly accumulated the precious cargo and provided letters of introduction to the Canton merchants who would buy it If another felt convinced that he could turn a handsome profit running fresh beef to Oregon, then ice to California, J &amp; W would supply the live cattle, sending the crazy young cowboys of Lahaina up into the hills to lasso the wild animals that had been introduced into the islands by Captain Vancouver in 1794.</p>

  <p class="normal">To win the good wishes of the mariners, J &amp; W also provided many free services. If a sailor wanted to marry a native girl, there was no point in applying to Reverend Hale to conduct the ceremony, for he frowned on such alliances and invariably spent at least an hour praying with the sailor and pointing out that God had long ago warned against the sin of whoring after the heathen. Dr. Whipple, however, had been given the right by Kelolo to solemnize such marriages, and many families who were destined to live in Hawaiian history, producing the powerful half-caste politicians who organized the islands, sprang from marriages which started in the J &amp; W store, where Reverend Whipple used Amanda, Captain Janders and his wife Luella as witnesses. Abner, of course, held that all participants in such marriages were living in whoredom, and he told them so.</p>

  <p class="normal">J &amp; W also served as mail drop for the fleet, and sometimes musty letters would lie in their bins for years before sailors came rolling up the wooden stairs and along the porch, shouting, “Any mail for me?” The wiry wanderer would sit in one of the J &amp; W chairs and read of family affairs that had transpired forty months ago. Then he would ask John Whipple for a piece of paper, and the doctor would explain, “That building at the corner. It’s a writing room for sailors, and if you ask for Mr. Cridland, he’ll take care of everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Frequently, ship captains would transmit from the distant whaling grounds requests to J &amp; W for a half-dozen replacements for their crews, to be picked up when the ship reached Lahaina. Captain Janders knew that whalers preferred stout Hawaiian boys, and he provided them at five dollars a head, but when none were available, he would visit Kelolo and tell the one-eyed, toothless police marshal, “Round up eight or ten deserters for next month,” and Kelolo would move his men through the countryside, dragging in as worthless a lot of murderers, cowards, ship-jumpers, adulterers and hopeless drunks as any nation of the day could have provided. No American deserter could be so degenerate or worthless but that some kind Hawaiian family would give him refuge; they even fought the police to keep the murderers from arrest, but when the rogues were finally lodged in jail, Mr. Cridland, from the Seamen’s Chapel, would move among them, explaining, “If you’re taken back to America in chains, you’ll be tried and sent to jail. But if you volunteer, you’ll not only get wages but also escape trial.” And with Abner’s help, usually in the form of long prayers with the dissolute rogues, Cridland would whip the men into reasonable shape, and as soon as the short-handed whaler hove into sight, Kelolo would release the imprisoned vagabonds, and Captain Janders would march them to the pier, where he would announce to the incoming captain: “A fine lot of men here for you to choose from!” And on every such recruitment J &amp; W would make its small commission.</p>

  <p class="normal">Other letters of more personal content sometimes arrived, and one day in 1831 Captain Janders sent Whipple through Lahaina, seeking the Hawaiian Pupali, for a letter awaited him from Valparaiso and it appeared to contain a substantial sum of money.</p>

  <p class="normal">When fat Pupali came to the store, Janders explained, “I no savvy, Pupali! One lettah for you, but.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Me no savvy read,” Pupali grinned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Okay. You lissen for me. I speak for you dis papah,” Janders said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Alu, alu,” Pupali nodded, his eyes bright with anticipation.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Janders opened the Valparaiso letter, a handful of British pound notes fluttered to the floor, and Pupali jumped upon them, pinning them down one after another, like a man swatting cockroaches. “Pehea dis money? It b’long for me?” he grinned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll see,” Janders said, pressing out the thin paper on which the letter was written. ” ‘To my good friend Pupali, of Lahaina,’” Janders began. “Well, at least the letter’s for you. Now we’ll see about the money,” Janders announced, and fat Pupali laughed at the large circle that had now gathered at the startling news that one of their men had received a document from Valparaiso.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who’s it from?” an onlooker asked, and Captain Janders carefully smoothed down and inspected the last few lines of the message. “It’s from Captain Hoxworth!” he said with some surprise. At the name of the feared whaler, some of the Hawaiians drew back, for the memory of Hoxworth’s cannonading was still vivid in their memories.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wha kine talk he make?” Pupali asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sending you herewith, my long and trusted friend, the sum of forty-five pounds sterling, which is a goodly sum of money and which an English ship captain whom I bespoke off the Japan Coast gave me as a present when I gave him your daughter Iliki. He was a fine-looking man and promised to treat her well and said he would take her home with him to Bristol when his cruise was over. Since Bristol is on the other side of the world, you will probably not see Iliki again, but when I last saw her she was happy and in good health. I could not bring her back to Lahaina as I had made a full cargo off Japan and was sailing directly home, where a girl like Iliki would not be well received. Since I had to do something, it seemed to me better that I pass her along to a decent English captain than leave her in Valparaiso, where she would certainly get into trouble. I am sending you his entire gift, less five pounds which I gave Iliki for herself, because I think it good for a woman to have some money of her own in a strange country. I hope to see you again soon. Give my love to your wife and your other daughters. They are all good girls. Your trusted friend, Rafer Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was the island consensus that Captain Hoxworth had behaved rather well in this matter, for all who knew Valparaiso and New England agreed that a girl like Iliki would not have prospered in either locale, and while it seemed likely that the English captain would pass her along to some other ship when the time came for him to return to Bristol, there was always the chance that he might grow fond of the lively girl and take her with him. Lahaina believed implicitly that the gift had indeed been fifty English pounds and that Captain Hoxworth had accounted honestly for all of it. His foresight in sequestering five pounds for the girl herself was widely praised, and carefree Pupali was suddenly looked upon as a wealthy man.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the transaction was forcefully condemned by Reverend Hale, who, as soon as he heard of it, hurried to J &amp; W to satisfy himself that the letter was authentic. He then sought out Pupali and charged in Hawaiian: “You cannot keep that money, Pupali. For a father to profit from the sale of his own daughter would be infamous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is it a great kapu?” the fat Hawaiian asked, with his wife and three daughters at his elbows.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A kapu so horrible that there is no word for it,” Abner explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you just used a word for it,” Pupali hopefully pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I used several words,” Abner snapped. “What I mean is that civilized languages are not required to have a single word because such an act . . .” He stopped in confusion and started over by stating flatly, “It is a horrible act, Pupali. You cannot keep that money.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall I do with it?” Pupali asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think,” Abner said after due reflection, “that you should turn it over to the church . . . absolve yourself of the sin of which you are now a part.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Pupali got the money, laid it out carefully and studied it. Then he shook his head negatively. “No,” he reasoned, “if this money is as kapu as you say, isn’t it better that it harm only me and not something as fine as your church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner coughed and explained, “It has always been the job of the church to correct the wrongs in any society, Pupali. If you give the money to a worthy cause, its kapu will be washed away.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“On the other hand,” Pupali argued, “your fine church has already been destroyed because the spirits of the land were angry at the way you built it . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was a fire and a wind,” Abner corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And now if you make even your own god angry at the church, it would surely burn down again,” Pupali reasoned triumphantly. “So I cannot let you run this risk, Makua Hale, I will keep the money.” In fact, things had worked out so well for the shiftless man through the sale of Iliki, that he now started introducing his three other daughters to as many whaling captains as possible, but they had grown fat and careless and found no takers.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>SPITE</span> of many defeats, these were good years for Abner and Jerusha. They now had four children, two boys and two girls, each apparently gifted with superior intelligence. Abner was disappointed that the young ones could not play with the Janders and Whipple children, but since both Mrs. Janders and Amanda stubbornly allowed their offspring not only to associate with Hawaiians but actually to speak that lascivious language, the Hale youngsters were kept rigidly alone within their walled garden. They appeared at church each Sunday, handsomely scrubbed, and often at twilight Abner would lead them to the waterfront, where they would study the marvelous islands that rimmed Lahaina Roads, and the clever children would play the game of “Spot the Whales!” in which at proper seasons of the year they would try to detect mother whales and their babies. The family came to enjoy these end-of-day respites as the finest part of the week, and much of the poetry of speech that marked the children derived from these hours when they watched the sunsets and the islands. In December the sun set almost over the middle of Lanai, as if it were a fireball going back to sleep in the dead volcano of that gracious island, but in June the great fiery sun sank off the coast of Molokai, rushing with crimson and orange streamers into the blue ocean. Then, with daylight fading, the children would listen for the talking owls and the gentle motion of the rising wind in the coconut palms.</p>

  <p class="normal">What they loved best, however, was when their father pointed toward the rotting hulk of the Thetis and said, “I remember when your dear mother and I sailed from Boston in that brig.” And he convinced the children that they belonged to three precious fraternities: “You are the children of God. All men are your brothers. And you are descended from the bravest group that ever came to Hawaii, the missionaries that sailed aboard the Thetis.” One night Micah whispered to his mother, “Father tells us that all men are brothers, but the ones who sailed on the Thetis are a little better than the others, aren’t they?” And to the boy’s surprise his mother said, “Your father is correct. The world holds no finer people than those who sailed aboard the Thetis.” But Micah noticed that year by year, in his father’s stories of that fateful voyage, the waves got higher and the space in the little stateroom more cramped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha found abiding joy in these days, for her nine years in Lahaina had taught her how to master life within a grass house. Her two great enemies were bedbugs and cockroaches, but scrupulous cleanliness controlled the first and meticulous care in wrapping every edible crumb in time dismayed the roaches so that they marched away to some more careless house. Even so, the grassy walls, lined though they were with smooth and fragrant pandanus matting, were convenient hiding places for all kinds of insects, and often at night one would roll over on his pallet and hear the squashing sound of some hard-shelled vermin being crushed. Nor could the dust from the pebbled floor ever be adequately controlled. But life was possible, and at times even palatable.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was some talk between Amanda Whipple and Luella Janders that their patient sister Jerusha was killing herself in the damp grass shack, and together they sent a petition to the mission board in Honolulu begging for some lumber. “Our husbands have volunteered to build a decent house for this Christian and long-suffering woman, if you will but supply the timbers,” they wrote. But since one of the signatories was Amanda Whipple, who was known to have encouraged her husband when he abandoned the mission, and since Whipple had twice been additionally censured for marrying American sailors to Hawaiian girls, the petition came to naught, and Jerusha continued to live and work inside the dark, damp grass shack.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, had he known of Amanda’s move, would have been outraged, for he stubbornly maintained his original conviction: “We have been sent here as the servants of God. Through gifts to the mission, He will provide for us as He deems best.” It was, however, trying to Jerusha to see her four children clothed only in such remnants as the mission board could send her from the charity barrels, and she tried her health still further by constantly ripping apart gift clothing, smoothing out the larger pieces of cloth thus provided, and sewing them into new garments for her children. On one point, however, she was adamant: “We have got to have books for Micah. If you don’t write to the Board demanding them, I shall have to.” She was not above stopping whaling captains on the streets and begging them for any books which they might have done with and which her brilliant son could read. “I am trying to teach him all he requires for entrance into Yale,” she explained. “But he reads so fast and understands so well . . .” In one way or another she got the books.</p>

  <p class="normal">Each year Jerusha had had one moment of complete motherly happiness; it coincided with the arrival of the annual gift box from her parents in Walpole, New Hampshire. Each November they dispatched it, but she could never be certain when a ship’s captain would knock on her Dutch door, saying, “We’ve a box for you, ma’am.” How exciting it was to get that message, but how infinitely more exciting to see her family standing in a circle as Abner ripped away the top. There were dried apples, and spiced pears and hard dried beef. “These pants will be for Micah,” Jerusha would say carefully, lingering over each item. “And this dress will fit Lucy. David can have this and Esther this.” On the succeeding Sunday, at least, Jerusha could look back over her shoulder as her children marched to church in their new clothes, and she could be proud of them. She always allowed the box to stay in the house long after it was empty, and whenever she looked at it she could recall the cold winters of New Hampshire and the smell of cider.</p>

  <p class="normal">A major reason why Abner would have found it impossible to accept aid from the Whipples was this: a phrase of John’s kept running through his mind and seemed to him to summarize the apostasy into which his former roommate had fallen. At strange times Abner would hear ringing in his ears John’s sharp pronouncement: “I don’t think the alii sent the wind, and I don’t think God sank the ships.” The more he reflected on this the more contemptible it sounded. “In simple terms,” Abner rationalized, “what he has done is to equate heathen idols of the alii with God himself. How appalling!” And increasingly he kept away from John Whipple, for without either man’s being aware of the fact, as Whipple’s financial fortunes grew, so did Abner Hale’s deepening reliance upon the Lord; and since in Lahaina as elsewhere these lines of development are not parallel but are actually divergent, so that the distance between them increases, the two men grew not to comprehend each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, Whipple remained interested in Abner’s welfare, and it was with both amazement and relief that he heard one day from a Salem captain, lately from Boston, that a preposterous yet tantalizing thing was occurring on the wharves of that city. “Matter of fact, it’s no doubt completed by now,” the incredulous captain explained. “There was this man named Charles Bromley, out of New Hampshire, and he was building a complete two-storied house right on the dock within spitting distance of the bay. No cellar, but everything complete, even to window cords. As soon as it was done, carpenters went over the entire thing with paint brushes and numbered every piece of wood in the house. Draftsmen drew pictures of everything, -and indicated the numbers. Then what do you suppose happened?” the captain asked dramatically. “Damned if they didn’t start knocking the whole house down and carrying it aboard this ship, plank by plank.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What ship?” Whipple asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Carthaginian, Captain Hoxworth, out of Bedford,” the captain said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would deeply appreciate it, Captain, if you’d keep this matter a secret,” Whipple said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As a matter of fact,” the man said, “the house is headed for these islands. Honolulu, probably. I was so fascinated I spoke to this fellow Bromley. He didn’t want to talk but he did say that the idea was Captain Hoxworth’s. The captain came to him and said that this mission family in Honolulu . . . living like swine . . . you know, grass house, bedbugs, cockroaches. Why Bromley was building the house I didn’t get clear.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you promise me?” Whipple pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course,” the captain agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I assure you, Captain,” Whipple said, “you will be protecting a wonderful woman from hurt if you keep your mouth shut about this. And I shall, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dr. Whipple’s preoccupation with anything so minor as a new house was superseded when Abner became aware of mysterious events occurring in Lahaina without his being able to identify them; and since he considered himself arbiter of all that happened in the community, he was irritated to think that Hawaiians would wish to conduct important affairs behind his back. To the meeting in Honolulu he reported: “I first became aware of this unusual secretiveness four days ago when returning from inspection of a home that burned because the owner smoked tobacco, and after having admonished him for his sin, I happened to peer into Malama’s old palace grounds, where I spotted several kahunas I knew, and they were supervising the building of a large new house.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘What are you building there?’ I called.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘A small house! they replied evasively.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘What for?’ I inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘The other houses have grown musty,’ they lied.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘What other houses?’ I prodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘Those over there,’ they said, waving their arms in some vague direction.</p>

  <p class="normal">” ‘Exactly which ones?’ I insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This question they did not answer, so I pushed my way into the compound and inspected the new house, finding it spacious, with real doors, windows and two Chinese mirrors. “This is a very substantial house,’ I said to the kahunas, but they shrugged me off by saying, ‘It’s a pretty small house,’ so I left the deceiving rogues and went in turn to each of the other houses and smelled them, and not one was musty, so I challenged the kahunas and asked, ‘Tell me what you are building,’ and they replied, ‘A house,’ and I left the conspirators, convinced that something suspicious is afoot, but what it is I do not know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was pondering these exasperating mysteries when he saw from his Dutch door a line of seven natives coming down from the hills bearing maile branches and great bouquets of ginger flowers. Leaving his Bible-translating, he hurried to the roadway and demanded, “Why are you bearing maile and ginger?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t know,” the Hawaiians replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who sent you to the hills?” Abner insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where are you taking the flowers?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We don’t know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course you know!” he fumed. “It’s ridiculous to say you don’t know where you’re going,” and he limped after them to the waterfront, where they wandered off, each in his own accidental direction.</p>

  <p class="normal">Infuriated, Abner stood for some minutes in the hot sun trying to piece together his various clues. Then, jamming his hands into his coat pockets, he stomped over to J &amp; W’s and said brusquely, “John, what’s going on in Lahaina?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” Whipple parried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I just encountered seven natives bringing down maile and ginger. Why are they doing that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why didn’t you ask them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I did, and they’d tell me nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Probably some kind of ceremony,” Whipple guessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner both despised and feared this word, for it conjured up forbidden rites and heathen sex orgies, so he asked tentatively, “You mean . . . pagan ceremonies?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Whipple remembered. “Now that you bring it up, two days ago some of the whalers wanted extra supplies of tapa for calking. Usually I can find a hundred yards by snapping my fingers, but I went to a dozen homes, and they were all making tapa, but no one had any for sale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What were they doing with it?” Abner pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“They all said the same thing. ‘It’s for Kelolo.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this, Abner placed before the doctor the various bits of evidence he had collected, and when they had studied the facts, he asked, “John what’s going on?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” Whipple replied. “Have Kelolo and his children been in church recently?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, as pious as they ever were.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d keep my eye on Kelolo,” Whipple laughed. “He’s a wily old shark.” And for the rest of that day Abner brooded over the fact that an event of obvious significance had been masked from his surveillance; but his present exasperation was nothing compared to what it became when in the late afternoon he heard as if from a distant valley the muffled, haunting throb of a pagan drum. He listened, and it stopped. Then it began again, and he cried, “The hula!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Without even informing Jerusha of where he was going, he started out in search of the long-forbidden hula, and he followed the echoes from one area to the next, until at last he pinpointed them as coming from a house on the edge of town. Hurrying along a winding footpath, he was determined to catch the lascivious revelers and punish them, when suddenly from behind a tree a tall native casually stepped into the middle of the path, asking, “Where are you going, Makua Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s a hula in that house!” Abner said ominously, but the man must have been a sentry, for when Abner reached the place from which the drum had echoed, he found only a collection of sweet-faced men and women practicing hymns, with never a drum in evidence.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where did you hide them?” he stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hide what, Makua Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The drums.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We had no drums, Makua Hale,” they said with the most winning simplicity. “We were singing hymns for Sabbath.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when he reached home again, he heard once more the sound of drums, and he told Jerusha, “Something is happening in this town, and it drives me mad that I can’t find out what it is.” He ate no supper, but later, as the moon was rising, he announced sternly: “I shall not go to bed till I discover what evil is afoot.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Against Jerusha’s protests he donned his white shirt, best stick, claw-hammer coat and beaver hat. Then, fortifying himself with a stout cane, he went out into the warm tropical night and for the first several minutes stood silent under the stars and the sighing palms, trying desperately to detect what was occurring in his parish, but he heard nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wondered if Murphy had revived the hula in his grog shop, but when he crept past the saloon it was orderly. He then went to the pier, suspecting that whalers might have conspired with Kelolo in organizing a debauch, but the ships were silent in the ghostly moonlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then, as he stood at the far end of the pier, staring at the ships, he happened to see out of the corner of his eye a flickering light along the shore some distance to the south. He dismissed it with the thought: “A night fisherman with his torch on the reef,” but it did not move as a fisherman’s should, and he muttered, “That’s not one torch. It’s several.” And with this he remembered the new grass house at Malama’s, and he recalled the kahunas, and like a fish drawn to the torches, he limped off the pier and started walking along the edge of the coral reef, past the fort, past the great alii homes and out toward Malama’s, and as he walked silently through the sand, the torches grew brighter and it became obvious that a considerable celebration was in progress, one at which he was not welcome. He therefore moved stealthily, slipping from one coconut palm to the next until at last he came upon a hidden spot from which he could spy upon the palace grounds, and the first thing he saw was a concentration of guards at the gate that led from the public road into the compound, and he thought with satisfaction: “Those guards are there to keep me out. What evil are my people up to?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He had not long to wait for from a crowd of men who had been feasting on roast pig, Kelolo stepped forth in brilliant yellow robes, accompanied by six kahunas in feathered capes. Kelolo dropped his hand, and from an area near the beach a night drum began to sound, and then another, and finally a high-pitched variant which established a throbbing, disciplined rhythm. Suddenly, from the crowd, six women whom Abner had seen in the house singing hymns moved forth, naked to the waist and with red flowers in their hair, necklaces of polished black nuts about their shoulders and anklets of shark’s teeth which clicked as they began an ancient hula.</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, who had often railed against this dance, had never seen it, and now as the swaying skirts made of ti leaves moved in the faltering shadows, he noticed how solemn and graceful the dance was, for the women seemed to be disembodied spirits, undulating in response to night winds: a movement would start in their heads, work its way along their supple arms, and pass to their hips in one unbroken symphony of motion. “This isn’t what I expected,” Abner muttered. “I understood that naked men and women . . .” But his fleeting concession was interrupted by what now took place, for he stood appalled as a chanter leaped before the dancers and began to cry mournfully, yet in exultation:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Great Kane, guardian of the heavens, Great Kane, guardian of the night, King of the gods, ruler of all men, Kane, Kane, Kane! Attend our&#160; ceremony,&#160;&#160; bless&#160; our&#160; shore!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as Abner stared in -disbelief, from the new grass house Kelolo appeared, bearing in his reverent hands the ancient stone of Kane. It should have been long since destroyed, but it had survived through Kelolo’s love, and now he placed it upon the low stone altar near the shore. When it was in position he shouted, “Great Kane, your people welcome you home!” Over the crowd a deep silence settled as each Hawaiian filed past Kelolo to deck the altar with flowers, and when this was done the kahunas chanted. Then at a signal from Kelolo the drums hammered out a new and wilder rhythm; the hula dancers swayed more joyously; and the people of Lahaina welcomed back their ancient god.</p>

  <p class="normal">In spite of Abner’s hundred sermons and two hundred hymns about destroying heathen idols, this stone was the first he had seen, and he stared at it with unholy fascination, for the curious combination of reverence and ecstasy it inspired in these worshipers bespoke its real force, and through it the little missionary comprehended much of Hawaii that he had not known before: its persistent religious passions, its abiding sense of history, and its mysteriousness. With all his heart he longed to rush forth and strike down the altar that kept these un-Christian forces alive.</p>

  <p class="normal">But his attention was diverted from the idol to the figure of a man who now appeared from the new grass house. It was Keoki Kanakoa, in a golden trance, his mechanical movements betraying the deep hypnosis into which he had fallen. He was naked to the waist, his body rubbed with oil; about his loins he wore a brown tapa and across his left arm a feathered cape. His helmet was in the old style, with an elevated comb sweeping from the base of the neck to the forehead, and he wore a necklace of human hair from which dangled a huge whale’s tooth fashioned into a hook.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he walked toward the statue of Kane, a priest chanted: “He comes, the perfect man. His hair is dark and reddish, his figure is commanding, triangular from shoulders down, with narrow hips. He bears a straight back, has no deformity, no blemish. His head is squared from molding while an infant. His nostrils flare. His neck is short and muscular, and his eyes are intoxicating like the tree that lures fish into the ponds. He is the perfect man and he comes to worship Kane!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a trance, the young alii moved to the altar, bowed and cried: “Great Kane, forgive your son. Accept him once more.” And from the shadows Abner prayed: “Forgive him, Almighty God! He is in the possession of evil men and knows not what he does.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner now had to suffer a sharper blow, for from the grass house appeared Noelani wearing a golden tapa and Malama’s famous whale-tooth necklace. She bore flowers in her hair and moved solemnly toward the altar, while the priest cried: “She comes, the perfect woman. Her skin is flawless, soft and melting like the waves of ocean, lustrous and smooth like the banana blossom. She is fairer than the lehua petal, lovelier than the opening buds of breadfruit. Her nostrils flare from her straight nose. Her brow is clean and low. Her lips are full and her back is straight. Her buttocks are rounded, with cheeks like the bursting moon, solid like the foundations of Maui. She is the perfect woman, and she comes to worship Kane.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, stunned by this double apostasy, began to mumble: “They can’t go back to Kane! They know the catechism. Keoki’s been to Yale. They’re Congregationalists. They’re members of my church and I forbid it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the apostasy, complete though it was, formed merely the prelude to an event of much greater significance, for from the group of kahunas, whose night of triumph this was, a tall priest stepped forward bearing a black tapa, such as Abner had not seen before, and after a passionate prayer to Kane, this priest swirled the tapa wide in the night air, and when it was completely unfolded, brought it down about the shoulders of the brother and sister, crying: “From this moment on, you shall share forever the same tapa!” And he led the couple toward the waiting house.</p>

  <p class="normal">The drums leaped to wild rhythms. Dancers created violent gestures which erased memories of earlier beauty, and the kahunas chanted: “Noelani and Keoki are married.” Abner could tolerate no more. He leaped from his hiding place, swinging his stout club and shouting, “Abomination! Abomination!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Before the astonished gathering could apprehend him, he leaped to the altar and with a mighty swipe of his club sent the sacred stone of Kane spinning into the dust. In fury he kicked at the maile branches and the ginger. Then, dropping his club, he marched solemnly to the married couple, ripped away the black tapa, and cried, “Abomination!”</p>

  <p class="normal">By now the Hawaiians were recovered from their amazement, and Kelolo, aided by two kahunas, pinioned Abner, but they treated him gently, for they knew he was the priest of the other god, and what he had done was only his duty. So Kelolo pleaded softly, “Dear little friend, go home. Tonight we talk with other gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner broke loose and pointed his finger at Keoki, crying, “In God’s eyes this is an outrage.” Keoki looked at him glassily, and Abner cried, “Keoki, what has happened?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The giant alii stared at his old friend and mumbled, “I begged you, Reverend Hale, to make me a minister. If your church doesn’t want me . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A minister?” Abner shouted, and suddenly the hideousness of this night—the hulas, the living stone, the drums and the kahunas—overwhelmed him and he began to laugh hysterically. “A minister?” he repeated several times, until Kelolo placed his hand gently but firmly over the missionary’s mouth and had him dragged away from the ceremonies, but the God-driven little man struggled loose and rushed back almost to the bridal couple before he was apprehended.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keoki!” he shouted. “Are you proceeding with this marriage?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“As my father before me,” Keoki replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Infamous!” Abner moaned. “It puts you outside the pale of civilized . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Hush!” an imperious voice commanded, and Abner drew back. It was Noelani who came close to him and said softly, “Beloved Makua Hale, we are not doing this to hurt you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner looked at the beautiful young woman with flowers in her hair and he argued, with equal control, “Noelani, you are being tempted by these men to commit a grave sin.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Alii Nui did not argue, but pointed instead toward the dark hills, saying, “In former days we followed our own gods, and our valleys were filled with people. We have tried following yours, and our islands are sunk in despair. Death, awful sickness, cannon and fear. That is what you have brought us, Makua Hale, although we know you did not intend it to be so. I am the Alii Nui, and if I die without child, who will keep the Hawaiian spirit alive?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Noelani, dear little girl of my hopes, there are dozens of men . .. right here . . . who would be proud to be your husband.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But could their children be designated Alii Nui?” Noelani countered, and this line of pagan reasoning so infuriated Abner that he drew back and cried in dismal voice, “Abomination! Malama would curse you from, her grave!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, Kelolo confessed that he should have kept silent, but he could not, and asked tauntingly, “What directions do you think Malama gave me when she whispered on her deathbed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">In horror the little missionary, his pale face and watery blond hair shining in the torchlight, stared at Kelolo. Could what the alii said be true? Had Malama commanded this obscenity? The repulsiveness of this possibility was more than he could accommodate at the moment, and he stumbled from the compound while the kahunas restored Kane, and the drums resumed their nuptial beat.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bedazed, Abner moved along the dark and dusty road whose stones in recent years had witnessed so many changes. He saw the shadowy houses of the king and the wooden stores of the Americans who had scorned God and fought the mission. In the roads the whalers were snug-anchored, his permanent enemies, and at Murphy’s grog shop somebody was playing a lonely concertina. How alien these things were to his lacerated spirit.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the deep night he left the town and climbed a barren field strewn with rocks, and when he stumbled upon a clump of dwarfed trees he sat among their roots and looked back at his silent parish as if he were no longer responsible for it. To the south he could see the monstrous torches of the pagans. In the roads he could spot the swaying night-lights of the whalers, and between lay the grass-roofed shacks of the people. How miserable and grubby this town really was, how pitiful. What a minimum impression he had made upon Lahaina, how inconsequential his accomplishments. Malama had tricked him. Keoki had betrayed him. And Iliki was God knows where. Now even the gentlest of them all, Noelani, had turned against him and had rebuked his church.</p>

  <p class="normal">For nearly ten years he had worn only one coat; God had not once sent him a pair of trousers that fitted; he had acquired only such learned books as he could beg from distant Boston; his wife had slaved in a wretched hut; and he had accomplished nothing. Now, as dawn began breaking over his little town, he studied in humiliation of spirit the shimmering sea, the mocking whalers and the palace grounds where the torches were slowly burning out. And he wished ardently that he could call down upon this entire congregation, saving only the mission house and its uncomplaining occupants, some awful Biblical destruction.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Floods! Winds from the hills! Pestilence! Destroy this place!” But even as he begged God to inflict such punishment, the perverse lesser gods of the vicinity were preparing to launch what would be his crowning humiliation, for in the night that was to follow, the goddess Pele herself would visit once more her devotee Kelolo, and the upshot of this ghostly convocation would haunt Abner Hale for many months.</p>

  <p class="normal">When John Whipple, rising early to sweep out the store, saw Abner staggering down from the hills back to town, he ran out and grabbed the little man, asking, “Abner, what has happened?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Hale started to explain, but he could not pronounce the vile words. He hesitated dumbly for a moment, his eyes failing to focus properly, and then he pointed at a group of Hawaiians coming along the road from the palace. They wore maile in their hair, and a light step; they carried a drum and walked in triumph as they had a thousand years before, and Abner said weakly, “Ask them.” And he stumbled off to bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later that day he dispatched a letter to the missionaries in Honolulu reporting: “At four o’clock this morning, January 4, 1832, in the old palace of Malama the kahunas triumphed and the dreadful deed was done.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In daylight, when the auguries were studied and the kahunas were satisfied that a good marriage had been launched, they assured Keoki: “This night you have done a fine thing for Hawaii. The gods will not forget, and when your child is born you will be free to go back to your own church once more and become a minister.” But Keoki, shivering from the burdens which the gods throw upon some shoulders, knew that this could not be.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the following dusk Kelolo, gratified that he had protected the succession of his family in these heavenly islands, walked among the shadows and as he did so he met, for the last time on earth, the silent, delicate form of Pele, keeper of the volcanoes, dressed in silken robes, with strange glasslike hair standing out in the night breeze. She obstructed his pathway beneath the palms and waited for him to approach her, and Kelolo could see that her face was radiant with contentment, and when she took her place beside him, walking mysteriously through whatever trees came into her way along the narrow path, he felt tremendous consolation. And they continued thus for some miles, each happy in the other’s company, but when the walk ended, Pele did what she had never done before. She paused dramatically, raised her left hand and pointed south, directly through the Keala-i-kahiki Channel and onto Keala-i-kahiki Point, and she stood thus for some minutes, as if commanding Kelolo with her fiery yet consoling eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">He spoke for the first time and asked, “What is it, Pele?” but she was content merely to point toward Keala-i-kahiki, and then, as if wishing to bid farewell to this great alii, her dear and personal friend, she brushed past him, kissing him with fiery lips and vanishing in a long silvery trail of smoke. He stood for a long time, engraving in his memory each incident of her visit, and that night when he returned to his solitary shack outside the palace grounds he took down his two most sacred treasures: the whitened skull of his wife Malama and a very old stone, about the size of a fist, curiously shaped and well marked. It had been given him more than forty years before by his father, who had averred that the occult powers of the Kanakoas derived from this stone, which one of their ancestors recovered on a return trip to Bora Bora. It was, his father had sworn, not merely sacred to the goddess Pele; it was the goddess; she was free to roam the islands and to warn her people of impending volcanic disasters; but her spirit resided in this rock, and it had done so for generations out of mind, long, long before even the days of Bora Bora. And through the night Kelolo sat with his treasures, trying to unravel the divine mystery of which they were the most significant parts. In the morning his confusion was clarified, for a swift ship sped into Lahaina Roads with news that a massive surge of the volcano on Hawaii was threatening the capital town of Hilo and the citizens prayed that the Alii Nui Noelani would enter upon the swift ship and return, to stop the flow of lava that must otherwise wipe out the town.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the news was brought to Noelani, her impulse was to send Kelolo instead, for he was the friend of Pele. Furthermore, her discussions with Dr. Whipple had satisfied her that volcanoes were the result of natural forces whose eruption could almost be predicted scientifically, and she realized that the island stories of Pele were nonsense, but before she could discuss these conclusions with the messengers from Hilo, Kelolo hurried up and said, “You must go, Noelani. If Pele is destroying Hilo, it must be in punishment, and you should go where the lava is white-hot and remind her that Hilo loves her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are the friend of Pele,” Noelani replied. “You must go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But I am not the Alii Nui,” Kelolo said gravely. “Here is a chance for you to win the people to you forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot believe that Pele has anything to do Noelani objected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw her last night,” Kelolo said simply. “I talked with her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani looked at her father in amazement. “You saw Pele?” she demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I walked with her for two miles,” Kelolo replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did she give you any message?” Noelani asked incredulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">No, Kelolo lied. “But of course she warned me of the volcano on Hawaii. Yes, she pointed toward Hawaii.” But he knew that she had not done this; she had pointed in quite a different direction.</p>

  <p class="normal">^And you wish me to go to Hilo?” Noelani asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, and I will entrust to your care a stone that will enable you to halt the lava,” Kelolo assured her.</p>

  <p class="normal">And it was in this way, in the year 1832, that the Alii Nui Noelani Kanakoa left Lahaina with the curse of Abner Hale in her ears-- “This is madness, an abomination”--carrying a sacred stone and traveling by ship to the port town of Hilo, where from the bay she could see the overpowering advance of glowing lava, rolling slowly upon itself and crushing in fiery embrace all it encountered. The town was obviously doomed; by the next night the lava must encompass it, and from shipboard there seemed no use for a young woman to try to stop it.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the local kahunas breathed with relief when they saw Noelani alight, laden with the mana that heals, and start her painful climb to the lava face. Behind her streamed the entire population of the town, save only the local missionaries who were outraged by this heathenish performance. Up through the palm trees at the edge of town, through the hau bushes, and on into the scrubby brush marched the solemn, hushed procession. Now only a few yards ahead lay the crawling, crackling snout of lava: as each new flow cascaded down the mountainside it sped over former flows that in the meantime had cooled, using them as a passageway to lower ground, and as the living white-hot flow came to the dead tip of old lava, it poised a moment in the air, then rushed out in many new directions, consuming here a tree, there a house and beyond a pigpen. There would be a hissing and crackling of fire, and the doomed object would burn away in a sudden, fatal gasp. Then, as the ugly snout cooled, it formed a channel for the next burning flow.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was to this creeping, crawling, devouring face that the young woman Noelani journeyed, and as she approached the living fire she underwent a transformation, for what she had been summoned to do was no less than to confront the fire goddess herself and to challenge her in a work that had been carried on by volcanoes since long before the coming of the Polynesians, and in the mystery of these last moments, in the awful inner fires that were burning away at her reason, Noelani lost all sense of ever having been a Christian. She was a daughter of Pele, one in whose family the very being of the goddess had resided, and now, returning to the suzerainty of the fire goddess, Noelani planted her feet before the on-surging lava and decided that here she would stand and if need be, die.</p>

  <p class="normal">Holding the sacred rock of Pele aloft, she cried, “Pele! Great goddess! You are destroying the town of those who love you! I pray you to halt!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And standing there with the stone aloft, she watched new fires reach the ugly snout and start to gush forward toward the town of Hilo, and as the fires trembled, she threw into them tobacco, and two bottles of brandy which flamed furiously, and four red scarves, for that was a color Pele loved, and a red rooster and finally a lock of her own hair. And the fires of Pele hung in the snout, consumed the tobacco, and slowly froze into position. The flow of lava had halted at Noelani’s feet, but there were no cheers, only the soft prayers of all who had trusted that Pele would never destroy the town of Hilo. The fires went out. The probing fingers consumed no more homes, and in a daze of glory and confusion Noelani returned to her ship and went once more to Lahaina, there to await the birth of the child who, when she was gone, would take her place as intercessor with the gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">This halting of the lava was the worst single blow Abner Hale experienced in Lahaina, for coming so quickly after the defection of Keoki and his sister, it was interpreted as confirming their marriage; while Noelani’s demonstrated ability to influence the ancient gods convinced Hawaiians that they still survived, and many began drifting away from the Christian church. But what hurt Abner most was the hilarity with which Americans greeted the miracle. One profane captain kept shouting, “From here on count me a firm believer in Madame Pele!” Another promised, “Now if Noelani will only take care of the storms, I’ll join her church, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, suffering at each defection from his church and wincing at the American jibes, became obsessed with the lava incident and went about arguing with anyone who would listen: “The burning rock came so far and stopped. What’s so miraculous about that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, but who stopped it?” his tormentors would parry.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A woman stands before a nose of lava as it’s about to die down, and that’s a miracle,” he snorted contemptuously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ah, but what if she hadn’t been there?” the logicians queried.</p>

  <p class="normal">After some weeks Abner went at last, and grudgingly, to consult with John Whipple, and the young scientist reassured him. “When the internal pressures of a volcano become powerful enough, they erupt into violence. Depending solely upon the interior forces within the earth, and nothing more, lava is spewed forth and rolls down mountainsides. If there’s enough lava, it’s got to reach the ocean. If there isn’t, it stops somewhere en route.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are these things known?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“By anyone with a grain of intelligence,” Whipple replied. “Look at Lanai. Anyone can see it was a volcano once. Look at our own Maui. At one time it had to be two separate volcanoes, gradually coalescing along that line. I would guess that at some time all the separate islands we see from this pier were one great island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could that have been?” Abner queried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Either the islands sank or the sea rose. Either explanation would do.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The grandeur of this concept was too difficult for Abner to accept, and he retreated to certainty: “We know that the world was created four thousand and four years before the birth of Christ, and there is no record of islands having risen or fallen.” The idea was repugnant to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple was going to ask about the Flood, but he changed the subject and casually remarked, “Abner, why did you put yourself in such a bad light at the marriage of Keoki and Noelani? You surrendered a lot of influence that week.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was an abomination, unnatural, unclean!” Abner stormed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been thinking about it a great deal,” Whipple reflected. “What’s so dreadful about it? Now really, don’t quote me incidents from the Bible. Just tell me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s abhorrent and unnatural,” Abner stormed, still hurting from the actions of his two preferred Hawaiians.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s really so abhorrent about it?” Whipple pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Every civilized society . . .” Abner began, but his companion grew impatient and snapped: “Damn it, Abner, every time you start an answer that way I know it’s going to be irrelevant. Two of the most completely civilized societies we’ve ever had were the Egyptians and the Incas. Now, no Egyptian king was ever allowed to marry anybody but his sister, and if I can believe what I’ve heard, the same was true of the Incas. They prospered. As a matter of fact,” Whipple continued, “it’s not a bad system, scientifically. That is, if you’re willing to kill off ruthlessly any children with marked defects, and apparently the Egyptians, the Incas and the Hawaiians were willing to do so. Have you ever seen a handsomer group of people than the alii?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner felt that he was going to be sick, but before he could react to Whipple’s astonishing reflections, the doctor said, “Noelani has asked me to attend her at the birth of the baby.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course you rebuked her,” Abner said with assurance.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, No! A doctor could practice an entire lifetime and not meet such an opportunity,” Whipple explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You would be partner to such a crime?” Abner asked, stunned by the prospect.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Naturally,” Whipple said, and the two men walked back from the pier in silence, but when Abner reached home and sent the children out into the walled yard he confided in whispers to his wife the nauseating news that John Whipple was preparing to attend Noelani, but to his surprise Jerusha replied, “Of course. The girl deserves all consideration. This must be doubly frightening for her.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But John Whipple, a consecrated Christian!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The important thing is that he’s a doctor. Do you suppose I ever rested easily, knowing that a totally untrained man would be my attendant when the children were born?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Were you so afraid?” Abner asked in surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I began by being,” Jerusha said, “but my love for you made it possible to control my fears. Even so, I’m glad that Brother John is going to tend the girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner started to rant, but Jerusha had in these months of his defeat heard enough, and now she said firmly, “My dearest husband, I am afraid you are making a fool of yourself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” he gasped, rising and walking with agitation to the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are fighting the kahunas, and Kelolo, and Keoki and Noelani, and even Dr. Whipple. In church you speak without benevolence. You act as if you hated Lahaina and all that was in it. You’ve even withdrawn from your children, so that Micah told me, ‘Father hasn’t taught me Hebrew for two months.’ ”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have been sorely tried,” Abner confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I appreciate the shocks you’ve suffered,” Jerusha said tenderly, pulling her tense little husband into one of the whaling chairs. “But if, as I think, we are here engaged in a tremendous battle between the old gods and the new . . .” She saw that this phraseology hurt Abner, so she quickly modified it. “What I mean is, between heathenish ways and the way of the Lord, then we ought to fight with our subtlest resources. When the old seems about to reconquer the islands, we ought to combat it with . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve warned them all!” Abner shouted, rising from his chair and striding about the earthen floor. “I told Kelolo . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I meant was,” Jerusha said gently, rising to be with her agitated husband, “that in these crucial times you ought to be calmer than usual, quieter, and more forceful. You’ve told me how you pointed at the evil three, Keoki, Noelani and Kelolo, and told them in turn. ‘God will destroy you!’ But you haven’t told me or shown me how with Christ’s gentle love you have tried to guide the people in these confusing times. I’ve watched you become increasingly bitter, and, Abner, it must stop. It is you who are destroying the good you have accomplished.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I feel as if I had achieved nothing,” he said from the depths of his spiritual humiliation.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha caught her husband’s passing hand and imprisoned him, turning his pinched face to hers. “My dearest husband,” she said formally, “if I were to recount your accomplishments in Lahaina it would take the rest of my life. Look at that little girl in the sunlight. If you had not been here, she would have been sacrificed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I see her,” Abner said with racking pain in his heart, “I can see only little Iliki, that sweetest of all children, being passed from one whaling ship to another.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The words were so unexpected, for Abner had not spoken of Iliki for some time, that Jerusha, recalling her dearest pupil, felt bitter tears welling into her eyes, but she fought them back and said, “If in losing Iliki we impressed the islanders . . . and, Abner, they were impressed!” She stopped and blew her nose, concluding her remarks with a firm command: “My dearest counselor, you are to smile. You are to preach about great and lofty subjects. You are to win these</p>

  <p class="normal">people to the Lord with bonds of charity so profound that the island will be God’s forever. You . . . must . . . preach . . . love.” With this master theme drummed into his ears by Jerusha, week after week, Abner Hale launched into the series of sermons which completed the winning of Lahaina, for as he spoke of the good life and the effect of God’s love upon mankind, he found that whereas he had believed that the islanders had turned away from the Lord, following the example of Kelolo and his children, exactly the contrary was the case; for the common people sensed that in Kelolo’s reversion to the old ways there was no real hope for them; and Abner’s thoughtful, quiet words of consolation found their way into many hearts that had rejected his earlier ranting.</p>

  <p class="normal">He preached a doctrine which was new to him . . . “The Holy Word of God as Interpreted by Jerusha Bromley, Modified by the Mysteries Encountered in an Alien Land.” He continued to hammer forcefully at man’s inescapable sin, but his major emphasis was now upon the consoling intercession of Jesus Christ. And what held his listeners doubly was his return to the tactic he had used as a very young man when preaching to the whalers on the Falklands: he addressed himself exactly to those problems which were perplexing his congregation, so that when he spoke of Christ’s compassion he said bluntly, “Jesus Christ will understand the confusions faced by His beloved son, Keoki Kanakoa, and Jesus will find it possible to love His erring servant, even as you and I should love him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">These words, when they reached Keoki in the grass palace, shattered him and drove him to the seashore, where he walked for hours, pondering the nature of Christ, as he recalled Him from the early, secure days in the mission school at Cornwall, in distant Connecticut. Then Jesus was perceptible reality, and the eroding loss of this concept agonized Keoki.</p>

  <p class="normal">When it was known that Noelani was approaching her time of delivery and that her child must be born before the next Sabbath, Abner took public cognizance of this fact, and instead of ranting against the circumstances in which the child had been conceived, he spoke for more than a hour and a half on the particular love Christ has for little children, and he recalled his own emotions at the birth of his two sons and two daughters, of his love for the child Iliki, who was now lost—for as he receded from the facts of Iliki’s disappearance, she became younger and younger in his memory—and of the joy that, all Lahaina must feel that their beloved Alii Nui was about to have a child. Since Hawaiians loved nothing more than children, with whom they were gentle and understanding, the two thousand worshipers sniffled quietly during the last fifteen minutes of the sermon, so that without quite knowing how he had accomplished the strategy, Abner found that his words of compassion had quite won Lahaina away from Kelolo and his kahunas, whereas his earlier ranting had been driving the Hawaiians back to the old gods. It was with confusion, therefore, that Lahaina awaited the birth of its next Alii Nui: as loyal Hawaiians they rejoiced that their noble line was to be continued; as Christians they knew that an evil thing had been done by Kelolo and his children.</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani bore twins, and Dr. Whipple, after he left the grass palace, reported to his waiting wife, “We must prepare ourselves for an ugly moment, Amanda. The boy was a handsome child, but the girl was deformed. I suppose they will abandon her before morning.” And when it was whispered through the town that Keoki Kanakoa, with his own hands, had taken his malformed daughter, and had placed her at the edge of the tide for the shark-god Mano, a wave of revulsion swept through the town.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Sunday the Lahaina church was jammed with nearly three thousand people, as in the old days, but on the way to service Jerusha said quietly to her husband, “Remember, my beloved husband, God has spoken on this subject. You are not required to.” And on the instant Abner threw away the text on which he was prepared to thunder, Luke 23, verse 34: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do,” and spoke instead from those majestic words of Ecclesiastes which had been much in his mind of late: “One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down. . . . All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. . . . The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. . . . There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He spoke of the permanence of Maui, of how the whales came back each year to play in the roads, and of how the sunset moved majestically through the months from the volcano of Lanai to the tip of Molokai. He referred to the whistling wind that could blow down churches and of the dead past when Kamehameha himself had trod these roads in mighty conquest. “The earth abideth forever,” he cried in soft Hawaiian, and Jerusha, listening to the inspired flow of images, knew that the hatred he had recently held for Lahaina was now discharged, for he passed on from the physical world that endures to the human society which occupies the world. “With all its imperfections it endures,” Abner confessed; but promptly he went on to his permanent vision of Geneva as it had been ruled by Calvin and Beza, and by suggesting many unspoken comparisons, he led his huge congregation to the truth he himself was seeking: some forms of human behavior are better than others; and at this point he returned to an idea which had, through the years, become a passion with him: that a society is good when it protects children. “Jesus Christ loves even children who are not perfect,” he preached, and on this awful contrast he concluded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did he say about the baby?” Keoki asked nervously, fingering his maile leaves in the old grass palace as his spies reported to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing,” the men replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did he rave about our sin?” the agitated young man pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. He spoke of how beautiful Maui is.” There was a pause and the men explained, “He did not speak either of you or of Noelani. But at one point I thought he intended saying that if you ever want to return to the church, he will forgive you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The effect of these words upon Keoki was startling, for he began to tremble as if someone were shaking him, and after a while he retired with his confusions to a corner of his room, placing himself formally upon a pile of tapa, as if he were already dead, and saying, “Go away.” As his friends departed they whispered among themselves, “Do you think he has decided to die?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The question was seriously discussed, for the Hawaiians knew that Keoki was tormented by doubts arising from two religions in conflict, and that whereas he had reverted with apparent willingness to Kelolo’s native gods, he had not easily cleansed himself of Abner’s God, and the incompatible deities warred in his heart. They also knew, as Hawaiians, that if Keoki ever decided to die, he would do so. They had watched their fathers and uncles announce, “I am going to die,” and they had died. Therefore, when one young man repeated his question: “Do you think Keoki has decided to die?” the group pondered it seriously, and this was their consensus: “We think he knows that he cannot survive with two gods fighting for his heart.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ACTUALLY</span>, the question was of no importance, for Lahaina was about to be visited by a pestilence known as the scourge of the Pacific. On earlier trips to Hawaii this dreadful plague had wiped out more than half the population, and now it stood poised in the fo’c’s’l of a whaler resting in Lahaina Roads, prepared to strike once more with demonic force, killing, laying waste, destroying an already doomed population. It was the worst disease of the Pacific: measles.</p>

  <p class="normal">This time it started innocently by jumping from the diseased whaler and into the mission home, where immunities built up during a hundred generations in England and Massachusetts confined the disease to a trivial childhood sickness. Jerusha, inspecting her son Micah’s chest one morning, found the customary red rash. “Have you a sore throat?” she asked, and when Micah said yes, she informed Abner, “I’m afraid our son has the measles.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner groaned and said, “I suppose Lucy and David and Esther are bound to catch it in turn,” and he took down his medical books to see what he should do for the worrisome fever. Medication was simple and the routine not burdensome, so he said, “We’ll plan for three weeks of keeping the children indoors.” But it occurred to him that it might be prudent to see if John Whipple had any medicine for reducing the fever more quickly, and so he stopped casually by J &amp; W’s to report, “Worse luck! Micah seems to have the measles and I suppose . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple dropped his pen and cried, “Did you say measles?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, spots on his chest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, my God!” Whipple mumbled, grabbing his bag and rushing to the mission house. With trembling fingers he inspected the sick boy and Jerusha saw that the doctor was perspiring.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are measles so dangerous?” she asked with apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not for him,” Whipple replied. He then led the parents into the front room and asked in a whisper, “Have you been in contact with any Hawaiians since Micah became ill?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Abner reflected. “I walked down to your store.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thank&#160; God,”&#160; Whipple gasped, washing his hands&#160; carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Abner, we have only a slight chance of keeping this dreadful disease away from the Hawaiians, but I want your entire family to stay in this house for three-weeks. See nobody.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha challenged him directly: “Brother John, is it indeed the measles?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is,” he replied, “and I would to God it were anything else. We had better prepare ourselves, for there may be sad days ahead.” Then, awed by the gravity of the threat, he asked impulsively, “Abner, would you please say a prayer for all of us … for Lahaina? Keep the pestilence from this town.” And they knelt while Abner prayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But men from the infected whaler had moved freely through the community, and on the next morning Dr. Whipple happened to look out of his door to see a native man, naked, digging himself a shallow grave beside the ocean, where cool water could seep in and fill the sandy rectangle. Rushing to the reef, Whipple called, “Kekuana, what are you doing?” And the Hawaiian, shivering fearfully, replied, “I am burning to death and the water will cool me.” At this Dr. Whipple said sternly, “Go back to your home, Kekuana, and wrap yourself in tapa. Sweat this illness out or you will surely die.” But the man argued, “You do not know how terrible the burning fire is,” and he sank himself in the salt water and within the day he died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now all along the beach Hawaiians, spotted with measles, dug themselves holes in the cool wet sand, and in spite of anything Dr. Whipple could tell them, crawled into the comforting waters and died. The cool irrigation ditches and taro patches were filled with corpses. Through the miserable huts of the town the pestilence swept like fire, burning its victims with racking fevers that could not be endured. Dr. Whipple organized his wife, the Hales and the Janderses into a medical team that worked for three weeks, arguing, consoling and burying. Once Abner cried in frustration, “John, why do these stubborn people insist upon plunging into the surf when they know it kills them?” And Whipple replied in exhaustion, “We are misled because we call the fever measles. In these unprotected people it is something much worse. Abner, you have never known such a fever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Nevertheless, the little missionary pleaded with his patients, “If you go into the water, you will die.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want to die, Makua Hale,” they replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha and Amanda saved many lives by forcing their way into huts where they took away babies without even asking, for they knew that if the fevered infants continued their piteous moaning their parents would carry them to the sea. By wrapping the children in blankets and dosing them with syrup of squill, thus encouraging the fever to erupt through skin sores, as it should, the women rescued the children, but with adults neither logic nor force could keep them from the sea, and throughout Lahaina one Hawaiian in three perished.</p>

  <p class="normal">In time the measles reached even Malama’s walled-in compound, where it struck Keoki, who welcomed it, and his baby son Kelolo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Here the Hales found the shivering Kanakoa family, and Jerusha said promptly, “I will take the little boy home with me.” And there must have been a great devil near Abner’s heart, for when his wife had the dying child in her arms he stopped her and asked, “Would it not be better if that child of sin … ?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Jerusha looked steadily at her husband and said, “I will take the boy. This is what we have been preaching about in the new laws-- All the children.” And she carried the whimpering child and placed him among her own.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she was gone, Abner found that Keoki had escaped to the seashore where he dug a shallow grave into which salt water seeped, and before Abner could overtake him he had plunged in, finding relief at last. Abner, limping along the reef, came upon him and cried, “Keoki, if you do that you will surely die.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall die,” the tall alii shivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Compassionately, Abner pleaded, “Come back, and I will wrap you in blankets.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I shall die,” Keoki insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There is no evil that God cannot forgive,” Abner assured the quaking man.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your God no longer exists,” Keoki mumbled from his cold grave. “I shall die and renew my life in the waters of Kane.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner was horrified by these words, and pleaded, “Keoki, even in death do not use such blasphemy against the God who loves you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your god brings us only pestilence,” the shivering man replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am going to pray for you, Keoki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s too late now. You never wanted me in your church,” and the fever-racked alii splashed his face with water.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keoki!” Abner pleaded. “You are dying. Pray with me for your immortal soul.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Kane will protect me,” the stricken young man insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no! No!” Abner cried, but he felt a strong hand take his arm and pull him from the grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was one-eyed Kelolo, who said, “You must leave my son alone with his god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Abner shouted passionately. “Keoki, will you pray with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am beginning a dark journey,” the sick man replied feebly. “I have told Kane of my coming. No other prayers are necessary.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The incoming tide brought fresh and colder waters into the grave, and at that moment Abner leaped into the shallow pit and grasped his old friend by the hands. “Keoki, do not die in darkness. My dearest brother . . .” But the alii drew away from Abner and hid his parched face with his forearms.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Take him away,” the young man cried hoarsely. “I will die with my own god.” And Kelolo dragged Abner from the grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the pestilence was ended, Abner and Jerusha brought the baby Kelolo, now healthy and smiling, back to the palace, where Noelani took the child and studied it dispassionately. “This one will be the last of the alii,” she predicted sadly. “But it may be better that way. Another pestilence and we will all be gone.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly, Abner said, “Noelani, you are aware that Jerusha and I love you above all others. You are precious to God. Will you return to His church?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall, gracious young woman listened attentively to these contrite words and for herself was inclined to accept them, for she had never taken the kahunas seriously, but when she thought of her dead brother her resolve was hardened, and she replied with bitterness, “If you had shown Keoki half the charity you now show me he would not be dead.” And it was coldly apparent that she would never return to the church … at least not to Abner Hale’s church.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>ONE DAY</span> in early 1833, after John Whipple had recovered from his exhaustion due to the pestilence, he was accosted by a sailor who asked, “You Doc Whipple?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” John said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was directed to hand you this personally,” the sailor explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where are you from?” the doctor asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Carthaginian. We’re in Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Eagerly, yet with apprehension, Whipple opened the letter, which said simply:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Dear Dr. Whipple. You have good sense. Can you get Abner and Jerusha Hale out of Lahaina for a week? I intend to build them a house. Your trusted friend, Rafer Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell your captain yes,” Whipple said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When can we arrive?” the sailor inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Next Monday.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He will be here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Whipple fabricated an intricate plot, whereby Abner was called to what the missionaries called “a protracted meeting” at Wailuku, where long ago he had tended Urania Hewlett at her death. To Abner’s surprise, the Whipples said, “Amanda and I need a rest. We will join you, for holiday.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The children?” Jerusha asked, frightened, for she had never left them during a single night since Micah’s birth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Mrs. Janders’ll care for the children,” John insisted, and although both Abner and Jerusha thought it perilous to risk their offspring to a woman who allowed Hawaiians to nurse her babies, they at last consented, and the four who had known one another so well aboard the Thetis began their pleasant hike to Wailuku, but when they reached the summit pass that divided the two halves of the island, John Whipple stopped and stared sadly back at the additional valleys that had been depopulated by the measles and said, “Abner, somehow we’ve got to get a virile new people into these islands. Because if dying Hawaiians were able to marry strong newcomers . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whom could you get?” Abner asked, mopping his forehead.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I used to think other Polynesians would do,” Whipple replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But recently I’ve changed my mind. It’ll have to be Javanese. A totally new bloodstream.” As he paused he idly compared the parched leeward areas he had just left with the green windward area they were approaching. “Curious,” he mused.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is?” Abner asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was looking at the two halves of this island,” Whipple replied. “The rain falls over here, where it isn’t needed, but it never falls on our side, where the big fields lie barren, Abner!” he cried with positive delight. “Why couldn’t a man bring the useless rain over to where it’s needed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you seek to correct God’s handiwork?” Abner snorted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In such matters, yes,” John replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could you bring rain through a mountain?” Abner challenged.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know,” Whipple mused, but he kept staring at the contrast between rainy windward and parched leeward.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were not long on their journey before the Carthaginian hove into Lahaina Roads and Captain Rafer Hoxworth strode ashore. One-eyed Kelolo and a band of able policemen met the fiery whaler at the pier and leveled six guns at his chest. “Dis place kapu for you, kapena! We no aloha for you, you damn hell!” the old alii warned, in his best pidgin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoxworth, brushing aside the guns, announced: “I come only to build a house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No girls on the ship!” Kelolo said sternly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I want no girls,” Hoxworth assured him, striding briskly up to the mission house. To his following sailors he said, “Get every movable thing out of that house. And be careful!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The removal took only a few minutes, and when Hoxworth saw how pitifully little the Hales had—their only substantial furniture being the chairs and tables he had provided them—he held his big right hand over his mouth, for he was biting his lip with incredulity. “Cover it up,” he said, and when this was carefully done, he applied a match to the old grass house, and in a moment it blazed into the air, with its burden of insects and memories. When the ground was cleared he said, “Dig.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The cellar was broad and deep. It would be cool in the blazing hot summers at Lahaina, and when it was done Captain Hoxworth lined it with building stones hewn from coral, and these he continued some distance above the earth, so that when he started to erect the house itself, it had a solid foundation. Now he ordered his sailors to bring him the corner posts, each numbered, and he began the fascinating task of reassembling the house exactly as it had been when standing on the wharf in Boston.</p>

  <p class="normal">In three days the job was well launched and obviously on its way to success, and it was while lounging in the offices of Janders &amp; Whipple, that Captain Hoxworth, having told Pupali and all his women to go to hell and leave him alone, heard the story of Keoki Kanakoa and his sister Noelani. “You mean that tall, handsome girl I saw skimming naked past my ship one day on a surfboard?” he asked quizzically.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. All this happened to her,” Janders said gloomily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why, hell!” Hoxworth growled. “She’s the best-looking girl the islands ever produced. You mean she’s out there in that grass shack . . . alone?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She has the usual women-in-waiting,” Janders explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I know,” Hoxworth said contemptuously, making huge circles with his hands to indicate the women who usually attached themselves to the alii. “I mean . . . she’s just there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s a hell of a way to live!” he boomed. “Just because she got mixed up with a lot of crazy nonsense. Janders, I’m going out there.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wouldn’t’,” the older man said. “They don’t remember you well in this town.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To hell with memories!” Hoxworth cried, slamming his big fist onto the arm of his chair. “I’m thinking of staying in Honolulu, Janders. Sail my ship to Canton in the China trade. Maybe build a couple of ships. Could I get cargoes here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If your charges are low enough,” Janders replied cautiously. “I’ve got a lot of skins I’d like to get to China.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think you’ll get ‘em there,” Hoxworth said, and he strode out of the office and along the main road to the grass palace of the alii. At his approach, guards ran to inform Kelolo, but before the old man could prevent Hoxworth from doing so, the bold captain had bowed graciously, shoved open the gate, and marched into the grass palace where he found Noelani.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” he said, extending his big right paw, “I’ve been wanting to meet you ever since I saw you riding naked past my ship. That must have been thirteen years ago. You were a dazzling beauty in those days, ma’am. You’re lovelier now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you come to find someone else to sell?” Noelani asked coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, ma’am. I’ve come to find me a wife. And I feel in my bones that you’re the one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani started to reply to this abrupt assertion, but before she could do so, Hoxworth thrust upon her a bolt of choice Canton silk and a flood of words: “Ma’am, I suppose you know why I came back to Lahaina. My actions last time have preyed upon my conscience, and I deplored seeing an American man and woman living as those two did. If I offended you on my earlier visit, I now apologize, but with that out of the way, ma’am, I want to tell you that I propose running my ship henceforth in the China trade. I’ve bought a house in Honolulu, and for some time I’ve been looking for a wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why did you not find a wife in Boston?” Noelani asked coldly. “Tell you the truth, ma’am,” Hoxworth replied . . . But at this moment Kelolo rushed up with some guards and burst into the room to save the princess; but she, in turn, dismissed her father and said that she wished to talk with the captain.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Truth is,” he continued as if there had been no interruption, striding back and forth before the doorway leading to the garden, “I proposed once to one of those peaches-and-white-linen women of Boston, and I failed to win her. Since then I’ve come to prefer the lustier women of the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is Iliki?” the alii asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I hope she’s in good hands,” Hoxworth said bluntly. “Where would she be if she were here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The question caused Noelani to reflect, and to gain time she asked, “When will the house be finished?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In two days, ma’am, and that’s why I think it important that you dine with me tonight aboard ship. I want you to see your quarters … in case you should ever decide to join me on one of the trips to Canton.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The sound of this word, this distant city from which had come her clothes and her furniture and which she had never expected to see—nor had she any reason to see it—so captivated Noelani that she betrayed her excitement, whereupon Hoxworth said bluntly, “Noelani, you’ve had a bad time here, caught up in things of which you were no part. Why not leave it all? It’s a sad, messy business that you will never conquer. I offer you a wild, exciting life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have a son, you know,” the proud woman said tentatively.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bring him with you. I’ve always wanted a tyke of my own aboard ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He belongs to the people . . .” she hesitated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then leave him with the people,” he said firmly, and before she could protest, he had caught her by the hand and drawn her to him, kissing her harshly upon the mouth and pulling at her garments.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Go to the door and tell the women to guard it. You’re entertaining your husband-to-be.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She pushed him away, stood solemnly before him and asked, “Could you forget that I was once married to . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Noelani!” he chided. “How many of the girls of this village have I kept in my cabin? That’s also past. Now I need a wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I meant, that it was my brother who . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He pondered this question for a moment, then laughed again and said reassuringly, “With me each day that dawns begins a new year. I have no memories.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The tall captain’s words were warm in her ear, the kind of bold, sweet words an alii liked, and she thought: “This kapena is much like an alii. He is tall, eager to fight, and he is the leader of his men. He is tired of running after waterfront women. He owns an important ship and he was willing to take my son as his own. He is not pious, but I think he is honest. The day of the Hawaiian is dead, but the years of the white man are upon us.” To Hoxworth she said quietly, “I will go with you to the ship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He kissed her again and felt her wealth of hair cascading upon his hands, and it aroused him as the kisses of dark island girls had always done, and he whispered, “Tell the women to guard the door,” but she refused and said, “Not in this room. It is a center of the old ways. I will go with you to your ship.” And the town of Lahaina was astonished to see Captain Hoxworth and Noelani, the Alii Nui, walking down the dusty road beneath the palm trees, talking idly as if they were lovers. But they were more astonished when the tall girl, marvelously beautiful now that she was seeing daylight again, climbed into the captain’s rowboat and went out to the Carthaginian, where she stayed till dawn, and when at parting she looked at the handsome, well-kept cabin which was to be hers, she thought: “He is a real man, and I will be faithful to him. I will eat his food to please him. I will dress as he prefers, so that other men shall look at him and say, ‘Kapena is the lucky one.’ I will never say no to him”—and then a soft smile came to her face, as it would later come to the thousand Hawaiian girls who would marry Americans—”for I know that with my own words I can win him to a gentler life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Noelani saw Captain Hoxworth on each of the next two days, and on the last day of his visit to Lahaina, while his men were dragging a complete set of furniture from the Carthaginian to the new mission house, she was alone in the grass palace wrapping in tapa cloth two heavy thigh bones; one Keoki had given her before his death, and the other she had received directly for herself. Taking the bundles in her arms, she went out to her father’s small house and said to him, “Kelolo, my beloved father, I am leaving Lahaina, and I dare not take these oppressive gifts with me. You must return them to their grave. We cannot any longer live with such memorials haunting us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverently, he accepted the two great thigh bones, placing them tenderly on the earth before him. “Are you determined to go to Honolulu with the American?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I am seeking a new life.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“May it be a good one,” he said gently through his broken and lisping lips. He did not rise to bid her good-bye, for although he understood the pressures which were forcing her to act as she did, he could not condone them; and he was certain that she was rejecting the only true vocation and happiness she would know on earth. “May the goddess Pele . . .” he began, but she hushed his wish, unable to bear any further invocations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet on her part she said, “May the gods be good to you, Kelolo. May the long canoe ride swiftly until the rainbow comes for your departure.” She studied his worn old figure with its circular scars about the face and its gaping eye socket, and then she left, to board the ship, but when she reached the pier the sailors told her, “The kapena is not aboard yet,” and they directed her to the mission house, where, looking into the bright new room, she saw her intended husband sitting on a kitchen chair, turned backward, its arched back under his chin, and he staring moodily at the floor; and as she watched he rose and carried the chair with him, and set it down three or four times with great violence, making the entire house shudder with his fury. And for some minutes he stood there, pounding the chair into the floor and holding his head down, with his eyes closed and knots standing out on his forehead in dark passion; and she recalled his earlier words and thought: “He can boast that he has no memories, but I am pleased that he has. I thought he remembered only trivial things like selling Iliki.” And after he had thrashed the chair into the floor a dozen more times, to control himself from kicking the entire house into splinters, he carefully returned it to its place, gave the small wooden room one last lingering look and came out into the bright sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll go,” he said, and villagers, who had heard of the impending marriage, followed them to the pier, where they watched as the big captain caught Noelani in his arms and lifted her into the longboat.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the way home from Wailuku, John Whipple and his wife, as soon as they reached the summit of the trail, began gazing into the distance so markedly that Abner finally asked, “What are you looking for?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A great surprise,” John explained mysteriously, but the four had reached the last small hill before he was able to spot, beneath the branching trees, the roof line of the new mission house. “I see it now!” he cried. “Can you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hales looked futilely at the outlines of Lahaina and saw nothing. There was the broad reach of sea, the hills of Lanai, the dusty trails. And then Jerusha gasped, “Abner! Is that a house?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“At the mission! Abner! Abner!” And she broke into a run and dashed down off the hill, with her bonnet flying behind and her skirts causing dust, and when she reached the road she rushed on ahead, not waiting for anyone to catch her, crying all the time, “It’s a house! It’s a house!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally, gasping with excitement, she stood beside the stream and looked across the walled-in yard to where the old grass house had stood,, and there rose, as in a magic story, a New England farmhouse, snug and secure. She put her left hand to her mouth and looked dumbly first at the house and then at the approaching three, and finally she ran desperately to Abner and kissed him in public. “Thank you, my dearest friend and companion,” she said weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he was more surprised than she and looked at Whipple for enlightenment, and for the time being John thought it permissible to tell only part of the truth, so he explained: “Your father sent it out from Boston, Jerusha. We wanted to surprise you.” Later, when the association with Captain Hoxworth was fully developed, the two missionaries were so happy with their home that neither made complaint. They took the gift as having come from Charles Bromley, in Walpole, and they thought it proper to ignore the intermediary by whom the gift had been delivered, and who in fact had initiated the idea. Jerusha thought it a marvelous house in these respects: it did not harbor bugs; it did not have an earthen floor; it had a proper cellar for storing food; it had separate rooms for the children; it had a desk where Abner could work; and it had a kitchen. Jerusha was proud when the Hawaiians came to see it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first official visitor was Kelolo, bringing with him a large square of paper which he had got from J &amp; W and on which he wanted Abner to print the name <span>NOELANI</span>, after which, for no apparent reason that could be ascertained at the time—although later his purpose became clear—he sat on and on until Abner felt that he might have to ask the one-eyed old man to go. He recalled how his wife Malama had always loved the church, how Keoki had wanted to become a minister, and Noelani’s happy marriage in Honolulu. There seemed much more that he wished to say, but he did not say it, and at sunset when Jerusha interrupted, “Kelolo, my dear friend, we are about to have our sea biscuit and salt beef. Will you join us?” he gripped her hands passionately and wished her a world of luck. Finally, when he stood alone with Abner, he predicted, “Your church will last when you and I are both upon the rainbow, Makua Hale. It is a fine church, and through it you have done much good in Lahaina.” He then inquired if he might embrace the little missionary, and in the Hawaiian manner he rubbed noses and said farewell.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not yet dark when he walked down the dusty road, past the taro patch and the royal grounds over the little bridge where the whaling boats came for clear water and onto the grounds that Malama had loved. As he walked he thought happily: “There is always a chance that the night marchers may come along to take me away,” and he listened hopefully for the footfalls, but in vain. The walk did not tire him particularly, but he did feel himself to be an old man, and when he reached his small house he rested for a while before wrapping in the paper the three treasured objects he intended for his daughter: Malama’s necklace, the whale tooth hung on the hair of his hundred friends, his feathered cape, and the ancient red stone of Pele.</p>

  <p class="normal">When this was done, he placed the package in the middle of the room and proceeded to gather up his four remaining treasures: the skull of Malama, her right thigh bone which he had given Keoki, and her left, which had been Noelani’s heirloom now rejected: and most significant of all, the sacred stone of Kane, which he had protected from the missionaries for so many years.</p>

  <p class="normal">He carried these objects to the altar by the sea, where a canoe waited, unmanned and with a solitary paddle. Reverently, he moved the three bones onto a low tapa-covered table perched in the prow.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, ceremoniously, he covered them with maile leaves, whose memorable fragrance marked the night. This ritual completed, he placed the sacred stone on the platform which had so infuriated Abner, and here for the last time he spoke with his god.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are not wanted any longer, Kane,” he reported frankly. “We have been asked to go away, for our work is done. Malama is dead with a different god. Keoki is gone, and Noelani spurns you. Now even the kahunas worship elsewhere. We must go home.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But before we leave, great Kane,” the old man pleaded quietly, “will you please lift from your children in Hawaii the burdens of the old kapus? They are heavy and the young no longer know how to live with them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He started to carry the god to the canoe, but as he did so the awfulness of his act oppressed him and he whispered to Kane, “It was not my idea, gentle Kane, to take you from the islands you have loved. It was Pele who pointed to Keala-i-kahiki, the way that we must go. Now we shall go home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So speaking, Kelolo gathered up the god and wrapped him in a cape of yellow feathers, placing him in a position of honor in the prow. He then turned and looked for the last time at the grass palace, where he had known Malama, greatest of women and the most complete. “I am taking your bones back to Bora Bora,” he assured her, “where we shall sleep in peace beside the lagoon.” Bowing to the house of love, and to the rocky altar, ‘and to the kou trees whose shade had protected him, he climbed into the canoe and started paddling resolutely toward Keala-i-kahiki, and as he stood out into the ocean itself, he chanted a navigational song which his family claimed had been composed by some ancient ancestor on his way from Hawaii to Bora Bora:</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sail from the Land of the Little Eyes, Southward, southward To the oceans of burning heat . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">By morning he had entered exactly those oceans, and without water or food he paddled resolutely into them, a near-blind, toothless old man, bearing his god and the relics of the woman he had loved.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>JERUSHA ENJOYED</span> for less than three years the clean wooden house her father had sent her, for perversely, although she had managed to maintain her health in the grass shack, she could not do so in her comfortable home. “She’s worked herself to death,” Dr. Whipple said bluntly. “If she’d allow Hawaiian women to care for her children …”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner would not hear of this, so Whipple suggested, “Why not send her back to New Hampshire? Three or four cold winters with lots of apples and fresh milk. She’d recover.” This time it was Jerusha who was adamant.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is our island, Brother John,” she insisted stubbornly. “When I first saw it from the railing of the Thetis, I was afraid. But through the years it has become my home. Did you know that some time ago Abner was invited to Honolulu, but it was I who refused.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then I can give you only one medicine,” Whipple concluded. “Less work. More sleep. More food.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But with four children and a girls’ school, Jerusha found little time for resting, until at last she awakened one morning with her entire chest in a viselike grip that she could not adequately describe, except that she found much difficulty in breathing. Abner placed her beside an open window and hurried to fetch the doctor, but when Whipple reached the room, Jerusha was gasping horribly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Put her to bed, quickly!” John cried, and when he lifted his friend’s wife, he was appalled at how little she weighed. “Amanda,” he thought, “weighs more than she.” And he sent the children, running by themselves, to Captain Janders” home, and then he said quietly to Abner, “I am afraid she’s dying.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no need to whisper, for Jerusha sensed that she was near death, and she asked if Amanda and Luella could come into the room, and when the women were there she sent for her children and said that she would like to hear, once more, the great mission hymn, and all in the room, including the dying woman, chanted:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“From Greenland’s icy mountains,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>From India’s coral strand;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Where Africa’s sunny fountains</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Roll down their golden strand;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>From many an ancient river,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>From many a palmy plain,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>They call us to deliver</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Their land from error’s chain.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">“We have labored to do so,” Jerusha said wanly, and seeing that death was strangling at her throat, Amanda Whipple began to whisper the hymn that had launched them on their individual adventures on the golden strands. “Blest be the tie that binds,” Amanda began, but Abner could not join in the painful words, and when the wavering voices reached the poignant second verse, which seemed written particularly for those who travel in God’s work to far places, he fell into a chair and held his hands before his face, unable to look at the frail figure on the bed who sang in the perfect fellowship of which she was tie symbol:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“We share our mutual woes;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Our mutual burdens bear;</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And often for each other flows</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>The sympathizing tear.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">“My beloved husband,” she gasped in great pain, “I am going to meet our Lord. I can see . . .” And she was dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">She was buried in the Lahaina church cemetery, with a plain wooden cross, and with her children at the graveside, watching the white clouds sweep down from the mountains; but after the ceremony was ended, and the crowd dispersed, Amanda Whipple could not rest content with the niggardly marking of her grave, and she had carved in wood, which was later reproduced in stone, an epitaph which might have served for all missionary women: “Of her bones was Hawaii built.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In later years it would become fashionable to say of the missionaries, “They came to the islands to do good, and they did right well.” Others made jest of the missionary slogan, “They came to a nation in darkness; they left it in light,” by pointing out: “Of course they left Hawaii lighter. They stole every goddamned thing that wasn’t nailed down.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But these comments did not apply to Jerusha Hale. From her body came a line of men and women who would civilize the islands and organize them into meaningful patterns. Her name would be on libraries, on museums, on chairs of medicine, on church scholarships. From a mean grass house, in which she worked herself to death, she brought humanity and love to an often brutal seaport, and with her needle and reading primer she taught the women of Maui more about decency and civilization than all the words of her husband accomplished. She asked for nothing, gave her love without stint, and grew to cherish the land she served: “Of her bones was Hawaii built.” Whenever I think of a missionary, I think of Jerusha Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the hours following Jerusha’s death, the Americans in Lahaina held long discussions as to what should be done with the four Hale children, and it was tentatively agreed that Mrs. Janders should take them until such time as a ship could be found to carry the youngsters back to the Bromleys in Walpole, but since these plans had been worked out without consulting Abner, they were obviously not binding on him, and to the general surprise he announced, when Mrs. Janders offered to take the children, that he would continue to care for them; and they stayed inside the mission wall—Micah, aged thirteen; Lucy, ten; David, six; Esther, four—while their father tended their needs. In this he was much aided by Micah, a sallow, serious child who read voraciously and who had a vocabulary even greater than his erudite father’s, for often while the Whipple and Janders children were roustabouting near the mission grounds, Micah Hale, with nothing better to do, sat hunched inside the wall reading for pleasure either a Hebrew dictionary or Cornelius Schrevelius’ Greek-Latin Lexicon. The two little girls were dressed as Abner thought appropriate, in fitted basques with full-length sleeves, plain flowing skirts, pantaloons to the ankle, and flat straw hats with ribbon streamers, all dredged up from the bottoms of the charity barrels, and they too became extremely fast readers with vocabularies that astonished their elders. Only on Sundays did the general population see the Hale children, for then their father washed and polished them, easing them one by one into their best apparel and leading them solemnly behind him to the big church. At such times many mothers in the community observed, “They are so pallid. Like their mother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">All might have gone well, however, for Abner was a father who demonstrated deep love for his children, except that in the spring of 1837 the Carthaginian put into Lahaina on a routine visit to pick up Janders &amp; Whipple furs for an intended run to Canton, and while the handsome ship was loading, Captain Hoxworth idly roamed the tree-lined streets of the town; suddenly he snapped his fingers and asked a Hawaiian, “Where is Mrs. Hale buried?” Stepping briskly, the tall, powerful captain strode to the cemetery, stopping only at a wayside house to buy some flowers; and his intentions were peaceful, but when he reached the grave he had the great bad luck to find Abner Hale there, tending the grass that had grown up beside Amanda Whipple’s improvised marker; and when the whaler spotted Abner, the author of his constant grief, he flew into a dark and savage rage, shouting, “You goddamned little worm! You killed this girl! You worked her like a slave in this climate!” And he dove for Abner, catching him below the knees and bearing him violently onto the grave, where he began punching him about the head. Then struggling to his feet while Abner was still prone, he started raining kicks at the little man, crashing his heavy boots into Abner’s head and chest and stomach.</p>

  <p class="normal">Under such treatment, Abner fainted, but to lose the hateful enemy thus infuriated Captain Hoxworth additionally, and he grabbed him from the grave and began throwing him down again with tremendous force, shouting, “I should have kept you among the sharks, you dirty, dirty, dirty bastard.”</p>

  <p class="normal">How far the dreadful punishment would have continued is uncertain, for natives, hearing the fight, hurried in to rescue their beloved little minister, but when they reached him, they thought him dead. With love they carried him to the mission house, where unthinkingly they allowed the four Hale children to see their father’s mutilated figure, and the three younger ones began to weep, but sallow-faced Micah kneeled over his father’s battered face and began washing away the blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the days that followed, it became quite apparent to Dr. Whipple that Abner had suffered severe damage in the head, Captain Hoxworth’s huge boots having either displaced a piece of bone or dislodged a set of nerve ends; and for several days Abner looked blankly at his commiserating friends, who said, “We have told Hoxworth he can never again come into this port.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is Hoxworth?” Abner asked dully.</p>

  <p class="normal">But under Whipple’s care, the missionary recovered, although ever afterwards the people of Lahaina would frequently see him stop on his walks, joggle himself up and down as if resetting his brain, and then continue, an uncertain man who now required a cane. There was one particularly uncomfortable moment during his recovery when he discovered that his four children were not with him, but were lost somewhere among the heathen of Maui. He began to rant, and his voice raised to a wailing lament, but Amanda produced the children, for she had been tending them in her own home, and he was pacified.</p>

  <p class="normal">Both the Whipples and the Janderses were surprised, upon his recovery, to find that not only did he insist upon keeping the children with him; the children much preferred their life within the mission confines to the freer existence outside; and as soon as he was able, Abner re-established the curious, walled-in household on the mission grounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in 1840, an unexpected visitor arrived in Lahaina, and the pattern of life was permanently broken, for the arrival was a tall, emaciated, very striking-looking Congregational minister dressed in jet-black and wearing a stovepipe hat that made him seem twice his natural height. At the pier he announced, “I am Reverend Eliphalet Thorn, of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, of Boston. Can you lead me to Reverend Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And when the gaunt old man, spare and effective as a buggy whip, strode into the mission house, he was instantly aware of all that must have transpired, and he was appalled that Abner had tried to keep his children with him. “You should either find yourself a new wife, or return to friends in America,” Thorn suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My work is here,” Abner replied stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“God does not call upon his servants to abuse themselves,” Thorn countered. “Brother Abner, I am making arrangements to take your children back to America with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead of arguing against this sensible decision, Abner asked carefully, “Will Micah be able to enter Yale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I doubt that the boy’s preparation is adequate,” Thorn countered, ‘living so far from books.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this, Abner summoned his scrawny, sallow-faced son and bade him stand at attention, hands at sides, before the visitor from Boston. In a steady voice Abner directed, “Micah, I want you to recite the opening chapter of Genesis in Hebrew, then in Greek, then in Latin, and finally in English. And then I want you to explain to Reverend Thorn seven or eight of the passages which cause the greatest difficulty in translation from one language to the next.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Reverend Thorn wanted to interrupt the exhibition as unnecessary; he would accept Abner’s word that the boy could perform this feat, but when the golden words began to pour forth, the gaunt old missionary sank back and listened to their pregnant promises. He was struck by the boy’s feeling for language and was unhappy when he stopped, so that he asked, “How does such a passage sound in Hawaiian?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t speak Hawaiian,” Micah explained. When the boy was gone, Thorn said, “I’d like to meet some of the Hawaiian ministers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have none,” Abner replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is to carry on the work when you go?” Thorn asked, in some surprise.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am not going,” Abner explained. “But the vitality of the church?” Thorn pressed. “You can’t trust Hawaiians to run a church,” Abner insisted. “Has anyone told you about Keoki and his sister Noelani?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Eliphalet Thorn said coldly. “Noelani told me … in Honolulu. She now has four lovely Christian children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner shook his head, trying to keep all things in focus, but for a moment he could not exactly place where he had known Eliphalet Thorn before, and then it became clear to him, and he recalled the manner in which the grave, gaunt man had gone from college to college in the year 1821. “What you must do, Reverend Thorn,” Abner explained eagerly, “is go back to Yale and enlist many more missionaries. We could use a dozen more here at least.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have never intended sending an unlimited supply of white men to rule these islands,” Thorn replied severely, and his accidental use of the word rule reminded him of his major responsibility in visiting Hawaii, but the subject was difficult to broach, and he hesitated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he coughed and said bluntly, “Brother Abner, the Board in Boston is considerably displeased over two aspects of the Hawaiian mission. First, you have set up a system of bishoprics with central control in Honolulu, and you must know that this is repugnant to Congregationalism. Second, you have refused to train up Hawaiians to take over their churches when you depart. These are serious defects, and the Board instructed me to rebuke those responsible for these errors.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner stared coldly at his inquisitor and thought: “Who can know Hawaii who has not lived here? Reverend Thorn can throw down rebukes, but can he justify them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Thorn, having met the same kind of stubborn resistance in Honolulu, thought: “He is accusing me of intemperate judgment on the grounds that I know nothing of local conditions, but every error begins with a special condition.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Eliphalet Thorn was not at ease in delivering rebukes, and having warned Abner, he turned to happier topics, saying, “In Boston the tides of God seem always to run high, and I wish you could have witnessed the phenomenal changes in our church during the past few years. Our leaders have brought to the fore God’s love and have tended to diminish John Calvin’s bitter rectitude. We live in a new world of the spirit, Brother Abner, and although it is not easy for us older men to accommodate ourselves to change, there is no greater exaltation than to submit to the will of God. Oh, I’m convinced that this is the way He intends us to go.” Suddenly, the inspired minister stopped, for Abner was looking at him strangely, and Thorn thought: “He is a difficult, custom-ridden man and cannot possibly understand the changes that have swept Boston.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Abner was thinking: “Jerusha instituted such changes, and greater, in Lahaina seven years ago. Without the aid of theologians or Harvard professors she found God’s love. Why is this tall man so arrogant?” A single conciliatory word from Thorn would have encouraged Abner to share with him the profound changes Jerusha had initiated in his theology, but the word was not spoken, for Thorn, noticing Abner’s aloofness, thought: “I remember when I interviewed him at Yale. He was excitable and opinionated then. He’s no better now. Why are the missions cursed with such men?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, driven by that perverse luck which often frustrates full communion, Thorn stumbled upon a vital subject, and the manner in which it developed confirmed his suspicion that in Abner Hale the Church had acquired one of those limited, stubborn men lacking in capacity for growth who are such impediments to practical religion. “Brother Abner,” the questioning began, “I have come here to join you in ordaining any Hawaiians who are ready for the ministry. Will you assemble your candidates?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have none,” Abner confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thorn, already satisfied that he had identified Abner’s character, did not raise his voice. “I’m not sure I understand, Brother Abner. When young Keoki betrayed the church, didn’t you immediately recruit eight or ten better prospects?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I thought was,” Abner began, but his head felt out of balance, and he jogged himself from the right hip. With compassion Reverend Thorn waited, and Abner continued: “I felt that since the church had suffered such a terrible disgrace, it would be better if . . .” Then he caught a vision of Keoki standing before the altar of Kane, with the maile leaves about his shoulders and the whale’s tooth. “Well,” he concluded, “I thought the most important thing was to protect the church from another such debacle.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“So you conscripted no potential ministers?” Thorn asked quietly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no! You see, Reverend Thorn, unless you live with the Hawaiians you can’t really understand . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother Abner,” the visitor interrupted. “I have brought with me two fine young men from Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Missionaries?” Abner cried excitedly. “From Boston?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Thorn explained patiently, “they’re Hawaiians. I’m going to ordain them in your church, and I would be particularly happy if you could nominate some young man of Lahaina who seems destined for the church . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Hawaiians in Lahaina, Reverend Thorn . . . Well, I don’t even allow my children to associate with the Hawaiians in Lahaina. There’s this man Pupali, and he had four daughters, and his youngest, Iliki . . .” He stopped and his mind became brutally clear and he thought: “He would not understand about Iliki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The ordination ceremonies impressed Lahaina more deeply than any previous church activity, for when the congregation saw two of their own people promoted to full responsibility for Christianizing the islands, they felt at last that Hawaiians had become part of the church, and when Reverend Thorn promised that within a year some young man from Lahaina itself would be ordained, there was little discussed in the next days except one question: “Do you suppose they might choose our son?” But on the next Sunday came even more welcome news, for Thorn announced that the missionary board in Honolulu had decided that one of the two ordained Hawaiians, Reverend Jonah Keeaumoku Piimalo, should remain in Lahaina to preach in the big church and assist Reverend Hale.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Thorn sensed the joy that this announcement occasioned, he happened to be looking at John Whipple, who turned sideways to his little wife, Amanda, and shook her hand warmly as if the family had long discussed this move, and Thorn thought: “Isn’t it perverse? I like Whipple, who left the church, much better than Hale, who stayed. With his doctoring the poor and building a good business, Whipple is much closer to my idea of God than the poor little fellow sitting here beside me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the next morning Reverend Thorn sailed back to Honolulu, en route to Boston, taking with him the four Hale children, and when they left their father at the pier Abner said solemnly to each, “When you have learned the civilized manners of New England be sure to come back, for Lahaina is your home,” but to his brilliant son Micah he added, “I shall be waiting for you, and when you return a minister I shall turn my church over to you.” Thorn, overhearing these words, winced and thought: “He will forever regard it as his church . . . not God’s . . . and surely not the Hawaiians’.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It now came time for Thorn to bid good-bye to the missionary whom he had inducted into the service nineteen years before, and he looked compassionately at the halting little man and thought: “What a profound tragedy. Brother Hale has never even dimly perceived the true spirit of the Lord. If the score were tallied, I suspect he has done far more harm than good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner, his mind now beautifully clear, looked at his imperious inquisitor and saw him once more as the black-frocked judge he had been on that visit to Yale in 1821. He thought: “Brother Eliphalet moves about the world dispensing advice and thinks that by coming to Lahaina for a few days he can detect where we have gone astray. What does he know of cannon? Has he ever faced a rioting mob of whalers?” And with a sense of deep sorrow Abner discovered: “He will never know.” Then, his mind still competent, he developed an equally haunting thought: “I doubt that anyone will ever know . . . except Jerusha and Malama. They knew.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Farewell, Brother Abner,” Eliphalet Thorn called.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Farewell, sir,” Abner replied, and the packet stood out to sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>THE YEARS</span> that followed, Abner became one of the human signposts of the old capital, an increasingly befuddled man, limping about the city, stopping to adjust his brains and clicking his head sideways to relieve passing darts of pain. He no longer lived in the mission house, for others came to assume the major responsibilities of the church, but he frequently preached in flowing Hawaiian, and whenever it was known that he would occupy the pulpit, the church was crowded.</p>

  <p class="normal">For all official duties he continued to wear the shiny old clawhammer coat he had bought in New Haven and the black beaver hat. His shoes and other apparel he got as best he could from the charity barrels, and in time his life settled into a perfected routine, marked by three recurring highlights. Whenever a new ship anchored in the roads, he would hurry down to the pier and ask its people whether, in their travels, they had come upon the Hawaiian girl Iliki. “She was sold from here to an English captain and I thought that perhaps you might have intelligence of her.” No one had.</p>

  <p class="normal">His second calendar-marking moments came when, from the rude desk in the grass house in which he now lived, he released for printing another of his metrical renderings of the Psalms in Hawaiian, and when the printed sheets appeared, he would distribute the Psalms to his parishioners, and at the next church service would lead them in singing their praises.</p>

  <p class="normal">The final triumph, of course, came whenever he received mail from his children in America. His sister Esther, now married to a minister in western New York, cared for the two girls, while the boys were the responsibility of the Bromleys. Each of the children’s portraits had been drawn in black pencil at a studio in Boston, and they now looked down gravely from the grass wall: handsome, sensitive, alert faces.</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah, having graduated with top honors from Yale, was already a minister, preaching in Connecticut, but the most exciting news was that Lucy had met young Abner Hewlett, studying at Yale, and had married him. It was Abner’s intention to send his old friend Abraham Hewlett a brotherly letter of congratulation upon the joining of the two mission families, but he could not forget the fact that Abraham was married to a Hawaiian, nor could he forgive; and the subsidiary fact that the Hewletts were prospering exceedingly with their lands, and were now wealthy, did not alleviate Abner’s distrust of anyone who would consort with the heathen.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the saddest aspects of these years was the fact that all who witnessed the visible impairment of Abner’s faculties could at the same time observe John Whipple’s cultivation of his. Always a handsome young man, he now flowered into an enviable maturity: he was tall, lean, sharp-eyed, and bronzed from surfing. His jaw was prominent, and the fact that he had a heavy beard, which he shaved twice each day, gave him a dark, manly look, which he accentuated by wearing dark suits very closely fitted with six-button waistcoats. His black hair, at forty-four, was untouched by gray, whereas Abner’s was actually whitened, so that to see the two men of equal age side by side was shocking, and this was partly the reason why islanders always referred to Abner as the old man.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whipple also prospered in trade, for whalers now jammed the roads—325 in 1844; 429 in 1845—and they had to buy from J &amp; W. Following Captain Janders’ driving precept, “Own nothing, control everything,” John had become a master in manipulating the lands and wealth of others, and if an upstart attempted to open a major industry in Lahaina, it was usually Whipple who discovered the tactic whereby the man could be either bought out or squeezed out. When Valparaiso begged for more hides, it was Dr. Whipple who recalled seeing huge herds of goats on neighboring Molokai, and it was he who organized the expeditions to the windward cliffs. As honest as he was clever, he paid any man he employed a fair wage, but when his most skilled huntsman was tempted to organize a goat-shooting team of his own, selling the hides and tallow directly to an American brigantine for extra profit, the man suddenly found he could hire no boats to transport his hides, and after three months’ labor had rotted away on Molokai, the venture was abandoned and he returned to work for J &amp; W. Abner never understood how John Whipple could have learned so much about business.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once, on a trading mission to Valparaiso, Whipple’s schooner was laid over for two weeks in Tahiti, and John, as was his custom, improved the wasting hours by studying something of Tahitian ways and words, and it was out of this casual experience that he wrote the essay which dominated Polynesian research for some decades: “The Theory of Kapu,” in which he made this provocative suggestion. “In our concern over why the Tahitian says tabu and the Hawaiian kapu we are apt to digress into theories which, while entrancing, are probably irrelevant. What we must remember is that a group of learned English scientists transliterated the Tahitian language and set it into western ways, while a body of not so well-trained American missionaries did the same job for Hawaiian. In each case we must suspect that the visitors crystallized what was not really there. Would it not be wiser to believe that when the English spelled their word tabu, what they actually heard was something different--somewhere between tabu and kapu, but slightly inclining toward the former-- whereas when the Americans wrote their word kapu, what they heard was also something quite different--somewhere between tabu and kapu, but inclining slightly toward the latter? Much of the difference that we now observe between written Tahitian and written Hawaiian must be accountable for not by the actual differences between the languages but by the differences in the ears of the men who transliterated them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Thus we have many words for house: whare, fale, fare, hale, but they are all one word, and we should like to know how many of these differences can be attributed to the defective ear of the white man, whose system of spelling did much to crystallize error. I recall an educated Hawaiian who said to me one day in his native tongue, ‘I am going to see Mr. Kown.’ I replied, ‘Kimo, you know his name is Mr. Town,” and he agreed, pointing out, ‘But in Hawaiian we have no letter T, so we can’t stay Town.’ And he pronounced the name perfectly. We had imposed limits on his speech that did not exist before we arrived on the scene.</p>

  <p class="normal">“At the same time, however, the visitor from Hawaii to Tahiti is visibly struck by the changes that occurred when Polynesians from the latter islands journeyed north. In Hawaii their stature increased. Their skin became tighter. Their speech became sharper. Their tools underwent obvious changes, and of course their gods were transmuted. Most spectacular was the transformation of the bold, angular and oftentimes lascivious Tahitian hula into the languorous, poetic dance of Hawaii. Change occurred in all things: religion changed from wild vitality to stately formalism; government became stable and self-perpetuating; and what in Tahiti was merely ornamental featherwork became in Hawaii a subtle art of rare beauty. Thus the development of Tahiti’s god of the sea, Ta’aroa, into Hawaii’s god of hell, Kanaloa, becomes a change in both orthography and theology, but the latter is the greater.</p>

  <p class="normal">“In our studies of Polynesia we should start from this premise: Nothing that came to Hawaii remained unchanged; flowers, processes, words and men there found new life and new directions. But we must not be deceived by outward appearances, and especially not by word forms, into estimating the differences to be greater than they actually are. Scratch a Hawaiian, and you find a Tahitian.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Abner’s avocation was the Seamen’s Chapel, where he would often sit for hours with Chaplain Cridland, the sailor whom he himself had brought to God, and he thought: “Of all things I have accomplished, that accidental conversion of Cridland has borne the most fruit.” He felt that no life was more difficult or more fraught with temptation than that of sailors, and he was happy that he had been instrumental in erasing Lahaina’s brothels and grog shops.</p>

  <p class="normal">He existed on a pittance sent by the mission board, for he was no longer a full-fledged missionary, but Dr. Whipple kept close watch upon him, and if he required pocket money, either Janders or Whipple saw to it that he got a little. Once, a visitor, seeing the lonely grass shack, adorned only with the portraits of his children, asked compassionately, “Have you no friends?” And Abner replied, “I have known God, and Jerusha Bromley, and Malama Kanakoa, and beyond that a man requires no friends.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, in 1849, exhilarating news reached Lahaina and transformed Abner Hale into a spry, excited father, for Reverend Micah Hale wrote from Connecticut that he had decided to leave New England --it was too cold for his taste--and to live permanently in Hawaii, “for I must see once more the palm trees of my youth and the whales playing in Lahaina Roads.” Many mission children, after their years at Yale, wrote the heartening news that they were coming home, for the islands generated a persuasive charm that could exert itself across thousands of miles, but what qualified Micah’s letter as unusual was the fact that he was determined to cross overland to California, for he wanted to see America, and he predicted that sometime near the end of 1849, he would be boarding a ship out of San Francisco.</p>

  <p class="normal">Consequently, Abner found a map of North America and hung it on the grass wall, marking “it each day with his son’s imaginary progress across the vast continent, and from deductions that were remarkably accurate, he announced one day to the crowd in the J &amp; W store in late November of 1849, “My son, the Reverend Micah Hale, is probably arriving in San Francisco right now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Micah climbed down out of the Sierra Nevadas and started along the Sacramento to the booming San Francisco of the gold rush, he was a handsome, tall young man of twenty-seven, with dark eyes and brown hair like his mother and the quick intelligence of his father. The sallowness and delicate stature of his youth had been transmuted into an attractive bronze, and his chest had filled out from his long hike in the company of gold-seekers crossing the continent. He stepped forward eagerly, as if anticipating excitement at the next tree, and he had won the respect of his fellow travelers by preaching a simple Christianity characterized by God’s abiding love for his children, and the respect of the muleteers by nipping straight whiskey when the nights were cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">In wild and vigorous San Francisco he made acquaintance with many adventurers who had come from Hawaii to the gold fields and was asked to preach in one of the local churches, where after a brief reading of the Bible he captivated his audience by predicting that one day “America will sweep in a chain of settled towns from Boston to San Francisco, and will then move on to Hawaii, to which the American democracy must inevitably be extended. Then San Francisco and Honolulu will be bound together by bonds of love and self-interest, each advancing the work of the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you consider the Americanization of Hawaii assured?” a San Francisco businessman probed, after the sermon.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Absolutely inevitable,” Micah Hale replied, reflecting his father’s love of prophecy. Then, grasping the man’s hands in his own, he said forcefully, “My friend, that a Christian America should extend its interests and protection to those heavenly islands is ordained by our destiny. We cannot escape it, even if we would.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When you use the word we,” the businessman asked, “are you speaking as a citizen of Hawaii or as an American?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m an American!” Micah replied in astonishment. “What else could I be?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Reverend,” the Californian said impulsively, “you’re alone in the town and I’d esteem it a signal honor if you’d have dinner with me.</p>

  <p class="normal">I have a businessman from Honolulu visiting me, and he used to be an American. Now he’s a citizen of the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’d like to meet him,” Micah agreed, and he drove with his new friend through the excitement of the city to a point overlooking the bay. There they left their team and climbed a steep hill on foot until they reached a prominence which commanded a scene of far-stretching beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My empire,” the man said expansively. “It’s like looking out on creation!” He led the young minister inside and introduced him to a tall, powerfully built man with eyes set wide apart and a wealth of black hair that grew long at the ears. “This is Captain Rafer Hoxworth,” the Californian said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah, who had never before seen his father’s enemy, drew back in loathing. Hoxworth saw this and was challenged by the fact that the young man might insult him by refusing to shake hands. Accordingly, he activated his considerable charm, stepped forward and extended his huge hand, smiling compassionately as he did so. “Aren’t you Reverend Hale’s son?” he asked in an extra deep, friendly voice.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am,” Micah said guardedly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You look very much like your mother,” Hoxworth reflected, as he held onto the minister’s hand. “She was a beautiful woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Repelled by the sea captain of whom he had heard so many ugly reports, yet fascinated by the man’s calculated vitality, Micah asked, “Where did you know my mother?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In Walpole, New Hampshire,” Hoxworth replied, releasing Micah’s hand, but holding him at attention with his dynamic eyes. “Have you ever been to Walpole?” And he launched into a rhapsody on that fairest of villages, and as he spoke he could see that he was whittling away at Micah Hale’s resolve, and then with a sense of animal delight he saw that the young man was not listening to him but was looking over his shoulder at someone who had entered the room, and instinctively he wanted the young man to become fascinated, involved, hurt.</p>

  <p class="normal">In fact, Micah was staring at two people who stood inside the doorway. The first was Noelani Kanakoa Hoxworth, whom he had last seen in his father’s church at Lahaina, and if she had been beautiful in those days, she was now radiant, in a dress of jet-black velvet, her hair piled high and as shimmering as a polished kukui nut, and wearing about her slim brown neck a single gold chain from which dangled a glistening whale’s-tooth hook. Micah hurried over, grasped her hand and said, “Noelani, Alii Nui, I am so pleased to see you.” The tall woman, who now knew Hong Kong and Singapore as well she had once known Lahaina, bowed graciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">But it was not really Noelani that Micah had rushed to greet, for behind Mrs. Hoxworth stood the most beautiful girl Micah had ever seen. She was as tall as he, very slender, with wide shoulders and tapered hips over which a tight-waisted gown of many gores was fitted. She wore her dark hair piled on her vivacious head, and her complexion was set off thereby, for it was absolutely smooth and of a brownish-olive cast. Her eyes were unusually sparkling and her lips showed white and even teeth. At her ear she wore a large California flower, and when her father said, “Join us, Malama. This is Reverend Hale, from Lahaina,” she moved gracefully into the room, bowed slightly, and extended her hand in the American manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Meet my daughter, Malama,” Captain Hoxworth said, and he was grimly pleased to mark her effect upon the young minister.</p>

  <p class="normal">That dinner was the most exciting in which Micah had so for participated, surpassing even those held at Yale when the president of the college conversed brilliantly with his students, for Captain Hoxworth spoke of China; the Californian told of his trip southward to Monterey; and Mrs. Hoxworth, unlike the disciplined women who had often eaten with Reverend Hale in New England, was effusive in her recollections of storms at sea and the adventures one could experience in ports like Bangkok and Batavia.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do your ships go everywhere in the Pacific?” Micah asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wherever there’s money,” Hoxworth replied bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you ever sailed with your parents?” Micah asked the girl at his side.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is my first trip,” Malama replied. “Up to now I’ve been at the Oahu Charity School in Honolulu.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you liking San Francisco?” Micah continued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s much more vigorous than Hawaii,” she replied. “But I miss the sunny rainstorms at home. A visitor from Philadelphia came to Honolulu not long ago and asked how to get to J &amp; W’s, and he was told, ‘Go down to the first shower and turn left.’ ” The dining companions applauded the story, and young Malama blushed prettily, but what everyone waited to hear was Micah’s account of crossing the prairies, and under the excitement of Malama’s obvious interest in him, he expanded on his theme in a manner he had not intended.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The land reaches for a thousand miles in all directions, a waving, wonderful sea of possibilities,” he exclaimed “I dug into it a dozen times, and it was rich, dark soil. A hundred thousand people could live there. A million, and they would be lost in its immensity.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tell us what you said about the movement of America to San Francisco and on to the islands,” the Californian suggested, and at this, Rafer Hoxworth leaned forward and chewed on his expensive Manila cigar.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can see the day,” Micah expounded, “when there will be wide and well-traveled roads connecting Boston and this town. People will occupy the lands I saw, and enormous wealth will be created. Schools, colleges, churches will flourish. Yale College couldn’t begin to accommodate the millions . . .” He was prophesying, like Ezekiel. “What was your idea about Hawaii?” Captain Hoxworth interrupted impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When that takes place, Captain, there will be a natural impulse for America to leap out across the Pacific and embrace Hawaii. It will happen! It’s got to happen!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you mean that America will go to war against the Hawaiian monarchy?” Hoxworth pursued, edging his hands forward on the table.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! Never!” Micah cried, intoxicated by his own visions. “America will never employ arms to extend its empire. If this excitement over gold continues to crowd California with people, and if Hawaii flourishes, as it must one day, the two groups of people will naturally see that their interests . . .” He stopped in some embarrassment, for he sensed that whereas Captain Hoxworth agreed with what he was expostulating, Mrs. Hoxworth did not, and he said, “I beg your pardon, ma’am. I’m afraid I presumed when I explained what the Hawaiians will think at that moment.”</p>

  <p class="normal">To his relief, Noelani replied, “There is no need to apologize, Micah.” Then she added, “It’s clear that Hawaii must one day fall prey to America, for we are small and weak.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Ma’am,” Micah assured her with explosive confidence, “the people of America will not tolerate bloodshed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Quietly, Noelani reported, “We have been assured that there will shortly be bloodshed within your own country . . . over slavery.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“War? In America?” the young minister replied. “Never! And there will never be war with Hawaii, either. It is equally impossible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Young man,” Captain Hoxworth interrupted on the spur of the moment, “my ship is departing for Honolulu in the morning. I’d be proud to have you accompany us.” Then he added the explanation calculated to inspire the heart of any minister: “As my guest.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah, who instinctively knew that he should have no intercourse with this family enemy, hesitated, but at that moment, to Captain Hoxworth’s sardonic satisfaction and to Micah’s confusion, Malama placed her hand on his and cried, “Please join us!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah blushed and stammered, “I had planned to visit San Francisco for some days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We won’t wait!” Hoxworth boomed, in his calculated impression of a robust older friend. “We’re making so much money running food from Lahaina to the gold fields that a day lost is a fortune foundered.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You can see San Francisco later,” Malama said winsomely, and when Micah looked into her deep Polynesian eyes he felt logic pass into confusion, so that even though he had hiked three thousand miles to see the phenomenon of the west he said weakly, “I’ll move my things aboard . . . even though it is the Sabbath.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the Carthaginian, Micah did not spend much time discussing America with Captain Hoxworth or Hawaii with his wife. Instead, he tagged along wherever Malama moved, and with her he watched the stars and the dolphin and the changing clouds. The first days were cold, and she wore an Oregon fur that framed her face in caressing beauty, and once when the night wind was blowing the edges of fur about her eyes, Micah felt positively impelled to raise his hand and brush the fur away, whereupon she accidentally leaned upon his fingers, and he felt how remarkably soft her skin was, and he kept his hand near her cheek and then almost unknowingly allowed it to slip around behind her neck, pulling her lips to his. It was the first time he had kissed a girl and he felt for a moment as if a family of dolphin had struck the ship, and he drew back amazed, at which the tall island girl laughed and teased: “I do believe you’ve never kissed a girl before, Reverend Hale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I haven’t,” he admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did you enjoy it?” she laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s something that should be saved for a starry night aboard ship,” he said slowly, taking her properly into his arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rafer Hoxworth, who had planned these events, watched with gratification as young Micah Hale became increasingly entangled with Malama. Nevertheless, he experienced contradictory emotions toward the boy: he despised him and wanted to hurt him in some tormenting way; yet at the same time he saw constantly how much the young minister, resembled Jerusha Bromley, and when at meals the young fellow, spoke so intelligently of America’s destiny, Hoxworth was proud; so that on the seventh day he announced unexpectedly to his wife, “By God, Noelani, if the boy wants to marry Malama, I’ll say, ‘Go ahead.’ We could use him in the family.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t intrude into the Hale household again,” his wife pleaded. “Besides, what would you do with a minister in the family?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This one won’t be a minister long,” Hoxworth predicted confidently. “Too much get-up-and-go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon Captain Hoxworth called his daughter to his book-lined cabin and said, “Malama, you intending to marry young Hale?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think so,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“My blessing,” Hoxworth said, but when his daughter brought her suitor, trembling, into the cabin to plead for her hand, Hoxworth subjected the young man to a humiliating examination, focused primarily on money and the inevitability that a clergyman would never have enough of it to support a ship captain’s daughter, particularly one who had expensive tastes, and after about fifteen minutes of this, Micah Hale, who had boxed at Yale and who had worked hard in the wagon train crossing the prairies, lost his temper and said, “Captain Hoxworth, I didn’t come in here to be insulted. A minister has a fine, good life, and I will hear no more of your abuse.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stamped out of the cabin and ate his next three meals with the crew, and when Malama, in tears, came to find him he said proudly, “I’ll come back to your table when the captain of this ship personally apologizes.” After another day had passed, during which Noelani and her daughter cajoled Captain Hoxworth with assurances that Micah had acted correctly, the gruff captain surrendered, rammed a cigar into his teeth, and of his own accord sought out the young minister. Thrusting forth a huge hand he said with a show of real acceptance, “Glad to have a man like you in the family, Mike. I’ll perform the ceremony tomorrow morning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He hated the young man, yet he wanted him for a son. Partly because he knew that such a marriage would infuriate old Abner Hale and partly because he sensed that a half-caste girl like Malama required a strong husband, he proceeded with the ceremony, and as the ship passed into tropical waters, he assembled all hands aft, stood Malama and her mother to starboard and young Micah Hale to port, and bellowed forth a wedding service which he had composed himself. At the conclusion he roared, “Now if the groom will kiss the bride, we’ll issue a triple ration of rum for all hands. Mister Wilson will divide the crew into halves. One half can get blind-drunk now, but the other half must wait till nightfall.” It was a wild, joyous ocean wedding, and when the Carthaginian reached Honolulu, Captain Hoxworth immediately transshipped the newly married couple to Lahaina, for he was still not allowed to visit that port.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the island boat entered Lahaina Roads, boxed in as it was between the glorious islands, Micah caught his breath and looked alternately at the wild hills of Maui, the soft valleys of Lanai, the barren rise of Kahoolawe and the purple grandeur of Molokai. He whispered to his wife, “As a little boy I was brought to that pier to see the whales playing in these roads, and I always thought of this water as the reflection of heaven. I was correct.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the packet began discharging its passengers into the crowd of islanders who regularly jammed the little pier to greet any casual ship, but before Micah and his wife could disembark, some men at the rear shouted, “Let him through!” And with intense joy, Micah discovered that the newcomer was his father, whom he had not seen for nine years.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Father!” Micah shouted, but Abner had not been told that his boy was aboard the packet, and kept moving forward in his accustomed way, limping more, cocking his white head on the right side and stopping occasionally to adjust his brains. Coming upon a sailor he grabbed him by the shirt and asked, “On your travels did you by chance come upon a little Hawaiian girl named Iliki?” When the sailor said no, Abner shrugged his shoulders and started back to his grass hut, but Micah vaulted over the railing that separated him from the crowd and rushed to overtake his father. When the white-haired clergyman—then only forty-nine years old—realized that it was his son who stood before him, he stared for a moment, approved his handsome appearance and said, “I am proud, Micah, that you performed so well at Yale.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a curious greeting, this reference to Yale above all other values involved at the moment, and Micah could only grasp the diminishing shoulders of the old man and embrace him warmly, whereupon Abner’s mind cleared perfectly and he said, “I have waited so long for you to take over the preaching in our church.” Then, behind his son’s elbow, he saw a tall, lovely olive-skinned young woman approaching and instinctively he drew away.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is this?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is my wife, Father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is she?” Abner asked, afraid.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is Malama,” Micah explained with tenderness.</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment the beloved old name confused Abner Hale, and he tried to clarify his thoughts, and when he had done so he bellowed, “Malama! Is she Noelani Kanakoa’s daughter?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Father. This is Malama Hoxworth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The trembling old man retreated, dropped his cane and slowly raised his right forefinger, leveling it at his daughter-in-law. “Heathen!” he croaked. “Whore! Abomination!” Then he looked in dismay at his son and wailed, “Micah, how dare you bring such a woman to Lahaina?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Malama hid her face and Micah tried to protect her from his raving father, but scarifying, unforgivable words poured forth: “Ezekiel said, “Thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen!’ Get out! Unclean! Abomination! Foul, foul in the eyes of God. I will never see you again. You contaminate the island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was no halting the fiery old man, but in time Dr. Whipple rescued the bridal couple and led them to the refuge of his home, where he bluntly explained to the weeping Malama that Reverend Hale sometimes seemed insane, probably due to the fact that her father had once kicked him in the head. “I am so ashamed,” she replied. “I will go to him and assure him that I understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Micah could not stop her, and she hurried along the brook, past the mission house and up to the grass shack into which she saw Abner Hale disappear in tottering rage. “Reverend Hale!” she pleaded. “I am sorry that . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked out from his shack and saw a woman who seemed much like Noelani, more like Rafer Hoxworth, and she was his son’s wife. “Abomination!” he rasped. “Whore! Contaminator of the islands!” And as she gazed in horror, he limped over to the wall, reached up and ceremoniously ripped away the pencil sketch of his elder son. Tearing it into shreds, he threw them at Malama, whimpering, “Take him from Lahaina. He is unclean.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Those were the circumstances under which Micah Hale, most brilliant of the mission children, resigned from the ministry and became partner with Captain Rafer Hoxworth, a man he feared and who hated him, but they formed a brilliant pair—Hoxworth bold and daring, Hale most far-seeing of the Hawaii traders—and in time all ports in the Pacific became familiar with the trim ships which flew the blue flag of the H &amp; H line.</p>
