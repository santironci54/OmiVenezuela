  <h2>II<br/>From the Sun-Swept Lagoon</h2>

  <p class="normal">I <span>HAVE SAID</span> that the islands along the rupture in the ocean floor were not a paradise, but twenty-four hundred miles almost due south there did exist an island which merited that description. It lay northwest of Tahiti, already populated with a powerful, sophisticated people, and only a few miles from the island of Havaiki, the political and religious capital of the area.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Bora Bora, and it rose from the sea in sharp cliffs and mighty pinnacles of rock. It contained deep-set bays and tree-rimmed shores of glistening sand. It was so beautiful that it seemed impossible that it had arisen by chance; gods must have formed it and placed the bays just so, an illusion which was enhanced by the fact that around the entire island was hung a protecting necklace of coral on which wild ocean waves broke in high fury, trying vainly to leap inside the placid green lagoon, where fish flourished in abundant numbers. It was an island of rare beauty—wild, impetuous, lovely Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">Early one morning, while in Paris the sons of Charlemagne quarreled among themselves as to how their late father’s empire should be ruled, a swift single-hulled outrigger canoe, sped along by sturdy paddlers and a triangular sail, swept across the open ocean leading from Havaiki and sought the solitary entrance to the lagoon of Bora Bora, on whose shores a lookout followed the progress of the urgent canoe with dread.</p>

  <p class="normal">He saw the steersman signal his sailors to drop sail, and as they complied he watched the canoe pivot deftly in high swells that sought to crash it upon the reef. But with enviable skill the steersman rode with the swells and headed his canoe toward the perilous opening in the coral wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now!” he shouted, and his paddlers worked feverishly, standing the canoe off from the rocks and speeding it into the channel. There was a rush of water, a rising of huge waves, and a swift passionate surge of canoe and flashing paddles through the gap.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rest!” the steersman called quietly, in audible relief. Gratified with his minor triumph, he looked for approval to the canoe’s solitary passenger, a tall gaunt man with deep-set eyes, a black beard, and long thin hands in which he clutched a staff carved with the figures of gods. But the passenger offered no commendation, for he was lost in the contemplation of certain mighty processes which he had helped set in motion. He stared through the steersman, past the paddlers and onto the towering central rock that marked the heights of Bora Bora. It was from a point part way up the slopes of this rugged mountain that the lookout now rushed down steep paths leading to the king’s residence, shouting as he went, “The High Priest is returning!” The instinctive dread which the lookout felt was transmitted in his cry, and women who heard the message drew closer to their men and looked at them with new affection across dark, palm-thatched huts.</p>

  <p class="normal">Although the agitated lookout delivered his frightening message to the general community, he was actually speeding to alert one man, and now as he darted along in the shade of breadfruit trees and palms, he kept whispering to himself, “Gods of Bora Bora, speed my feet! Don’t let me be late!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Dashing up to a grass house larger than its neighbors, the lookout fell to the ground, shouting, “The High Priest is in the lagoon!” From the grassy interior a tall, brown-skinned young man, courtier to the king, poked a sleepy head and asked in some alarm, “Already?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He has passed the reef,” the lookout warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why didn’t you . . .” In great agitation the young man grabbed a ceremonial tapa robe made from pounded bark, and without waiting to adjust it properly went running toward the palace crying, “The High Priest approaches!” He hurried past other courtiers like himself and right into the royal presence, where he prostrated himself on the soft pandanus matting that covered the earthen floor, announcing with urgency, “The august one is about to land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The man to whom these agitated words were addressed was a handsome, large-headed man of thirty-three whose close-cropped hair showed gray at the temples, and whose unusually wide-spaced eyes were grave with wisdom. If he experienced the same dread at the High Priest’s return as did his underlings, he masked it; but the tall young courtier nevertheless observed that his master moved with unaccustomed alacrity to the treasure room, where he donned an ankle-length robe of light brown tapa bark, throwing about his left shoulder and around his waist a precious cordon made of yellow feathers, his badge of authority. He then adjusted his feather-and-shell helmet, while around his neck he placed a chain of shark’s teeth. At this appropriate moment the tall courtier issued a signal, and drums along the shore began to throb in royal rhythms.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We go to honor the High Priest,” the king announced gravely, waiting while an impressive train of tanned warriors, naked to the waist and wrapped in brown tapa, formed behind him. Almost against his will, the king found himself urging his men, “Hurry, hurry! We must not be tardy,” for although everyone acknowledged that he was supreme on Bora Bora, he had found it prudent never to be wanting in courtesies to the spiritual ruler of the island, especially since the attributes and requirements of the new god, Oro, were not yet clearly known. The king’s father had underestimated the power of the new deity, and during a solemn convocation in the temple of Oro, his high priest had suddenly pointed at him as one failing in reverence, and the king’s brains had been clubbed in, his body dragged away as the next human sacrifice to red Oro, the all-powerful, the uniter of the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">But in spite of the king’s care, when the royal procession left the palace the tall young courtier had to warn, “The august one already approaches the landing!” whereupon the king and all his retinue began to run, holding onto their various badges as they did. The king, aware of the ridiculous sight he presented, yet unwilling through fear to go more slowly, glared at the tall courtier whose information had been delivered late, and the aide, who was having difficulty keeping his tapa cloth straight as he ran, began to sweat and prayed beneath his breath, “If there is to be a convocation, O gods of Bora Bora spare me!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king stumbled on in the hot morning sun, angry, muttering, damaged in pride. But he did reach the landing place a few moments before the canoe, and although he could not have known it at the time, his sweaty embarrassment helped rather than hurt, for from the outrigger the High Priest noticed with satisfaction the king’s discomfort and for a moment allowed a smile to creep toward his lips. But it was quickly suppressed, and the priest resumed his aloof study of the mountain peak.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gently, the steersman brought his canoe to rest, careful lest any untoward accident draw the priest’s attention, for the paddlers knew what message the religious man was bringing from the temple of Oro, and on this day it behooved all men to be careful. When the canoe was secured, the High Priest disembarked with imperial dignity, his white-bark cape with its fringe of dog’s teeth shining against his long, black hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was a powerful symbol of Oro as he moved with his god-carved staff to meet the king, genuflecting slightly as if to indicate that he acknowledged the latter’s supremacy. Then, recovering his posture, he waited grimly while King Tamatoa, the supposed ruler, bowed low and held a subservient position long enough to impress all witnesses with the fact that power had somehow been mysteriously transferred from his hands into those of the priest. Then the king spoke.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, blessed of the gods!” King Tamatoa began. “What is the wish of Oro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The pressing crowd, handsome men and fine women, naked to the waist and dark-eyed, held its breath in apprehension, which the High Priest sensed and relished. He waited, while soft winds from the green lagoon tugged at palms that lined the shore and made the dark green leaves of breadfruit sway. Then he spoke solemnly: “There will be a convocation!” No one gasped, lest he draw fatal attention to himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest continued: “A new temple is to be erected in Tahiti and we shall convene to consecrate the god who is to live in that temple.” He paused, and visible fear crept over the faces of his listeners. Even King Tamatoa himself, who could with reasonable assurance count on being spared, felt his knees weaken while he waited for the dread details that completed any announcement of a general interisland convocation at Oro’s temple.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the High Priest also waited, appreciating that the longer his terror continued, the more effective it would be in impressing the sometimes recalcitrant Bora Borans with the temper and might of their new god. On this day he would maneuver the king himself into asking the fatal questions.</p>

  <p class="normal">Flies that had been feeding on dead fish along the lagoon shore now turned their attention to the bare backs of the waiting crowd, but no man moved lest in the next dreadful moments he become conspicuous. The king waited. The priest waited. Finally in a hushed voice Tamatoa asked, “When is the convocation?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tomorrow!” the High Priest said sternly, and his news was instantly interpreted as he had intended. Thought the king: “If the convocation is to be tomorrow, it must have been decided upon ten days ago! Else how could the news reach Tahiti in time for their canoe to return to Havaiki tomorrow? Our High Priest must have been in secret consultation with the priests of Oro during all those ten days.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The flies stung perspiring backs, but no man moved, awaiting the next ominous question. Finally Tamatoa asked, “How many men for Oro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Eight,” the priest replied, impersonally. Placing his staff before him, causing watchers in the muted crowd to fall back, the gaunt dark man in shimmering white robes moved off toward his temple, but when it appeared that he had finished with the crowd he suddenly whirled about, made a terrifying sound in his throat, and thrust his staff directly at the steersman who had brought him into the safety of the lagoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And this one shall be first!” he screamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! No!” the steersman pleaded, falling to his knees on the sand.</p>

  <p class="normal">Implacably, the great gaunt priest towered over him, pointing at him with the staff. “When the seas were upon us,” he intoned mournfully, “this one prayed not to Oro for salvation but to Tane.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, no” the sailor pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I watched his lips,” the priest said with awful finality. Attendants from the temple gathered up the quaking steersman and hauled him off, for his legs, surrendering to terror, could not be forced to work.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you!” the dreadful voice cried again, thrusting his staff at an unsuspecting watcher. “In the temple of Oro, on the holy day, your head nodded. You shall be second.” Once more the attendants closed in on the culprit, dragging him away, but gently lest Oro be offered as a human sacrifice a man who was bruised or in any way imperfect.</p>

  <p class="normal">Solemnly the High Priest withdrew and King Tamatoa was left with the miserable task of nominating the six additional human sacrifices. He asked, “Where is my aide?” and from a spot toward the rear of the crowd, where he had hoped to remain unnoticed, the tall and trembling courtier stepped forth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why was I late in greeting the sacred one?” the king demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The lookout stumbled. It was he who was tardy,” the aide explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the rear of the crowd a woman’s voice inadvertently blurted, “No, that is not true!” But the woman’s husband, a small man of no marked intelligence, was dragged before the king, where he shook like a torn banana leaf, and the king surveyed him with disgust. “He shall be third,” the king commanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oh, please no!” the lookout protested. “I ran true. But when I reached the palace,” and he pointed to the aide, “he was asleep.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king recalled his earlier impatience with the young courtier and announced peremptorily: “He shall be fourth. The rest shall be taken from the slaves.” With this he strode back to the palace, while the lookout and the tall courtier, already pinioned by the priests, stood in limp amazement, appalled by the catastrophe in which each had so accidentally involved the other.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the frightened crowd dispersed, each congratulating himself that for this convocation he had escaped the insatiable hunger of Oro, a young chief clothed in golden tapa, which indicated that he was of the royal family, stood bitter and silent in the shade of a breadfruit tree. He had not hidden himself through fear, for he was taller than most, better muscled than any, and marked by a lean, insolent courage that no man could mistake. He had remained apart because he hated the High Priest, despised the new god Oro, and was revolted by the incessant demand for human sacrifice.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest, of course, had immediately detected the young chief’s absence from the welcoming throng, a breach of conformity which so enraged him that during the most solemn part of the ceremony his penetrating gaze had flashed this way and that, searching for the young man. Finally the priest had found him, lounging insolently under the breadfruit tree, and the two men had exchanged long, defiant stares that had been broken only when a golden-skinned&#160; young woman with flowing hair that held banana blossoms tugged at her husband’s arm, forcing him to drop his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, with the ceremony ended, the stately wife was pleading: “Teroro, you must not go to the convocation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who else can command our canoe?” he asked impatiently.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is a canoe so important?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her husband looked at her in amazement. “Important? What could there be more important?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your life,” she said simply. “Wise navigators do not sail when the clouds are ominous.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He dismissed her fears and strode disconsolately to a fallen log that projected into the lagoon. Falling angrily upon it, he dipped his brown feet into the silvery waters, and kicked them viciously as if he hated even the sea; but soon his placid wife, lovely in the fragrance of banana blossoms, came and sat beside him, and when her feet splashed in the cool green waters, it was as if a child were playing, and soon her husband forgot his anger. Even when he stared across to the small promontory on which the local temple sat, and where the priests were dedicating the eight doomed men to Oro, he spoke without the animal anger that had possessed him during the ceremonies.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m not afraid of the convocation, Marama,” he said firmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid for you,” his wife replied.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look at our canoe!” he digressed, pointing to a long shed near the temple, under which a mammoth twin-hulled canoe rested. “You wouldn’t want anyone else to guide that, would you?” he teased.</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama, whose priestly father had selected the sacred logs for the craft, needed no reminder of its importance, so she contented herself with pointing out: “Mato from the north can guide the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Teroro divulged his real reason for attending the dangerous convocation: “My brother may need my help.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“King Tamatoa will have many protectors,” Marama replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Without me events could go badly,” Teroro stubbornly insisted, and wise Marama, whose name meant the moon, all-seeing and compassionate, recognized his mood and retreated to a different argument.</p>

  <p class="normal">She said, “Teroro, it is you mainly that the High Priest suspects of being disloyal to his red god Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No more than the others,” Teroro growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you’re the one who shows your disbelief,” she argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Sometimes I can’t hide it,” the young chief admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Furtively, Marama looked about to see if any spy had crept upon them, for the High Priest had his men in all places, but today there was none, and with her feet in the lagoon she resumed her careful reasoning. “You must promise me,” she insisted, “that if you do go to Oro’s temple, you will pray only to Oro, think only of Oro. Remember how the steersman’s lips were read.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been to three convocations at Havaiki,” Teroro assured her. “I know the dangers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But not this special danger,” his wife pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is different?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again Marama looked about her and again she saw nothing, so she spoke: “Haven’t you wondered why the High Priest spent ten extra days at Havaiki?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suppose he was preparing for the convocation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No. That must have been decided many days earlier. To permit canoes from Tahiti and Moorea to return to Havaiki by tomorrow. Last year a woman from Havaiki confided to me that the priests there consider our High Priest the ablest of all, and they plan to promote him to some position of prominence.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wish they would,” Teroro grumbled. “Get him off this island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But they wouldn’t dare make him paramount priest so long as his own island is not completely won over.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As Marama talked, her husband began to pick up a thread of importance, which often occurred when the wise moon-faced woman spoke, and he leaned forward on the log to listen. She continued: “It seems to me that the High Priest will have to do everything possible in this convocation to prove to the priests of Havaiki that he is more devoted to Oro than they.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In order to make himself eligible for promotion?” Teroro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He must.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you think he will do?” Teroro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama hesitated to utter the words, and at that moment an unexpected wind blew across the lagoon and threw small waves at her feet. She drew her toes from the lagoon and dried them with her hands, still not speaking, so Teroro continued her thought: “You think that to impress others, the High Priest will sacrifice the king?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Marama corrected. “It is your feet he will place upon the rainbow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro reached up and tugged at the tip of a breadfruit leaf and asked thoughtfully, “Will the killing then stop?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” his wife replied gravely, “it will go on until all your friends have left the lagoon. Only then will Bora Bora be safe for Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Men like Mato and Pa?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They are doomed,” Marama said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But you think not the king?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, the queenly young woman reasoned. “Your brother is well loved by the kings of Tahiti and Moorea, and such a bold step might turn not only those kings but people in general against the new god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But offering me to Oro would be permitted?” Teroro pursued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. Kings are always willing to believe the worst of younger brothers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro turned on the log to study his beautiful wife and thought to himself: “I don’t appreciate her good sense. She’s a lot like her father.” Aloud he said, “I hadn’t reasoned it out the way you have, Marama. All I knew was that this time there was special danger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is because you, the brother of the king, still worship Tane,”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only in my heart do I do that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But if I can read your heart,” Marama said, “so can the priests.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro’s comment on this was forestalled by an agitated messenger, his arm banded by a circle of yellow feathers to indicate that he belonged to the king. “We have been looking for you,” he told Teroro. “I’ve been studying the canoe,” the young chief growled. “The king wants you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro rose from the log, banged his feet on the grass to knock away the water, and nodded an impersonal farewell to his wife. Following the messenger, he reported to the palace, a large, low building held up by coconut-tree pillars, each carved with figures of gods and highly polished so that white flecks in the wood gleamed. The roof consisted of plaited palm fronds, and there were no floors or windows or side walls, just rolled-up lengths of matting which could be dropped for either secrecy or protection from rain. The principal room contained many signs of royalty: feather gods, carved shark’s teeth, and huge Tridacna shells from the south. The building had two beautiful features: it overlooked the lagoon, on whose outer reef high clouds of spray broke constantly; and all parts of the structure were held together by thin, strong strands of golden brown sennit, the marvelous island rope woven from fibers that filled the husks of coconuts. Nearly two miles of it had been used in construction; wherever one piece of timber touched another, pliant golden sennit held the parts together. A man could sit in a room tied with sennit and revel in its intricate patterns the way a navigator studies stars at night or a child tirelessly watches waves on sand.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beneath the sennit-tied roof sat King Tamatoa, his big broad face deeply perturbed. “Why has a convocation been called?” he asked peremptorily. Then, as if fearing the answer, he quickly dismissed all who might be spies. Drawing closer on the tightly woven mat that formed the floor, he placed his two hands on his knees and asked, “What does it mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro, who did not see things quickly himself, was not above reciting his wife’s analyses as his own, and now explained, “It looks to me as if our High Priest must be seeking promotion to the temple in Havaiki, but in order to be eligible he has to do something dramatic.” He paused ominously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like what?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like eliminating the last signs of Tane worship in Bora Bora. Like sacrificing you … at the height of the convocation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m fearful of just such a plot,” Tamatoa confessed. “If he waits till we’re in convocation, he could suddenly point at me the way they pointed at our father, and . . .” The troubled king made a slashing swipe at his brother’s head, adding dolefully, And my murder would be sanctified because Oro had ordained it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“More likely the High Priest,” Teroro corrected.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa hesitated, as if probing his younger brother’s mind, and then added petulantly, “And my death would go unavenged.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Self-pity was so alien to Tamatoa, whose warlike capacities and prudent leadership had kept little Bora Bora free from invasion by its larger neighbors, that Teroro suspected his brother of laying some kind of trap, so the younger man fought down his inclination to confess his own plans for the convocation and observed idly, “The canoe will be launched at noon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will it be ready by sunset?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will, but I hope you won’t be on it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am determined to go to this convocation,” Tamatoa replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only evil can befall you,” Teroro insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">The king rose from his mats and walked disconsolately to the palace entrance, from which he could see the majestic cliffs of Bora Bora and the sun-swept lagoon. “On this island,” he said with deep emotion, “I grew in joy. I have always walked in the shadow of those cliffs, and with those waves clutching at my ankles. I’ve seen the other islands, and the bays of Moorea are lovely. The crown at Tahiti is good to see, and the long beaches of Havaiki. But our island is man’s heaven on earth. If I must be sacrificed to bring this island into harmony with new gods, then I will be sacrificed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The images evoked by Tamatoa’s memories of the Bora Bora of their youth accomplished what his guile had been unable to do, and Teroro cried, “Brother, do not go to Havaiki!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?” Tamatoa asked, flashing around and moving back to the mats.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because your departure to the gods will not save Bora Bora.” “Why not?” Tamatoa demanded, thrusting his face close to Teroro’s.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because when the club falls, I shall kill the High Priest. I will rage through all Havaiki and destroy it. Then the other islands will destroy us.</p>

  <p class="normal">“As I thought!” the king cried sharply. “You have a plan to riot. Oh, Teroro, it will accomplish nothing. You cannot go to the convocation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will be there,” Teroro muttered stubbornly. The king stood grave in the morning shadows and pointed his right forefinger at Teroro. “I forbid you to leave Bora Bora.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment the warrior-king Tamatoa, burly and serious-faced, was a symbol of overpowering authority to his younger brother, and the projecting finger almost made Teroro tremble; for although he wanted to grasp his brother by that finger, and then by his hand, and finally by his strong arm and thus pull him down onto the mats for an honest conversation, the young chief could never have brought himself to touch the king, because he knew that the king was the instrumentality whereby the gods delivered mana—the spiritual sanctification of the heavens—to Bora Bora, and even to touch a king or pass upon his shadow was to drain away some of that mana and thus imperil not only the king but the entire society.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet Teroro’s desire for words with his brother was so great that he prostrated himself on the matting, crept on his belly to him, and pressed his face close to the king’s feet, whispering, “Sit with me, brother, and let us talk.” And while the flies droned in morning heat, the two men talked.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were a handsome pair, separated in age by six years, for a sister had been born between, and each was aware of the special bond that linked him to the other, for as boys their wrists had been opened one solemn day, and each had drunk the blood of the other. Their father, dead as a sacrifice to Oro, had named his first son Tamatoa, the Warrior; and then when a younger brother was born the family had reasoned: “How fortunate! When Tamatoa becomes king he will have his brother to serve him as high priest.” And the younger child had been named Teroro, the Brain—the intelligent one, the man who can divine complex things quickly. But so far he had not proved his name to be appropriate.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa, of course, had developed into a classical island warrior, rugged, big-boned and grave. Like his dedicated ancestors he had defended Bora Bora against all cabals and concentrations. Six times in his reign of nine years he had been called to beat back invaders from powerful Havaiki, so that the sudden supremacy of that island’s new god, Oro, was especially galling; the ancient enemy seemed about to conquer by guile what it had never been able to take by force. Teroro, on the other hand, had not lived up to his name, and showed no signs of becoming a priest. Tall and wiry, with a handsome thin face, he loved brawling, had an impetuous temper and was slow to grasp abstract ideas. But his greatest failing was that he could not memorize genealogies or sacred chants. His love was navigation and the challenge of unknown seas. Already he had driven his canoe to distant Nuku Hiva, while a run down to Tahiti was familiar play.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am afraid it is for you the gods will send the rainbow,” Tamatoa whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We have stood against them in the past, we can do so again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In the past they had canoes and spears. Now they have plans and plots. I don’t feel hopeful.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you afraid?” Teroro asked bluntly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the king confessed. “New ideas are afoot, and I can’t seem to grasp them. How has the High Priest succeeded in manipulating our people so successfully?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“New gods are popular, I suppose,” Teroro hazarded. “When our people see many sacrifices they know the gods listen. It makes the island seem safer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king studied his brother for a moment, then asked cautiously, “Would it not be possible for you to accept their new god?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Impossible,” Teroro said flatly. “I was born with the blessing of Tane. My father died defending Tane, and his father before him. I will never consider another god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king breathed deeply and said, “Those are my thoughts, too. But I am afraid the High Priest will destroy us, Teroro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How can he?” the impetuous young warrior demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“By tricks, by plans, by clever ideas.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll trick him!” Teroro cried in frustration. Slashing his hand across his knee he muttered, “I’ll trick his head into a mass of coconut jelly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s why you mustn’t attend this convocation,” Tamatoa said. Teroro stood humbly before the king, yet spoke stubbornly: “Beloved brother, that is why I must go.” Then, rising, he moved about the palace mats and said prophetically, “The High Priest will not destroy us. If we go down, he goes down with us. The whole island goes down. Brother, I swore to our father that I would protect you. I’m going to the convocation, to protect you. But I will give you my promise not to riot unless they strike you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They won’t strike me, Teroro. They’ll strike you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They had better strike with the speed of a hungry shark,” Teroro laughed, and with this he walked out into the glorious high noon of Bora Bora, when the sun blazed overhead and filtered through palm fronds and breadfruit leaves, making soft patterns in the dust. Naked children called back and forth in their games, and fishermen hauled their canoes onto the beach. The soporific haze of noon, compounded of sunlight and dust was upon the island, and all things were beautiful. How restful this moment was, when the sun hung for a moment in midheaven, casting no shadows; flies droned and old women slept. Through the beautiful and dusty heat Teroro moved slowly to where the great ceremonial canoe of Bora Bora rested, and as he went he called, “Into the water! Into the water!”</p>

  <p class="normal">From various grass houses along the lagoon, men appeared, drowsily wrapping themselves in tapa and swallowing the last bits of coconut. “Send for the priests to bless our canoe,” Teroro called, and soon four holy men arrived, pleasure on their faces, for among all the functions of this island, there was nothing that exceeded in common joy the returning of the ceremonial canoe to its natural element. Palm fronds that had enclosed the seaward end of the long shed were taken down, and the twin hulls of the immense canoe were edged carefully toward the water. Then a rare old priest named Tupuna, his long white hair piled on his head and stuck with skewers, separated his beard, and with his eyes on the lagoon and on the open sea beyond, cried:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“Ta’aroa, god of the dark and sweeping sea,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Ta’aroa, master of tempest and gentle calm,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Ta’aroa, protector of men with vision of the reef,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Ta’aroa, take Wair-for-the-West-Wind to thy bosom,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Take it to Havaiki and to Moorea and to Nuku Hiva,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the Black Shining Road of Ta’aroa,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the Black Shining Road of Tane,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the Road of the Spider,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the Much-traveled Road of Ta’aroa.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>God of the dark and sweeping sea,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Accept as thy gift, this canoe.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">In silence and in spiritual exaltation, Teroro pulled away the last prop that bound his glorious canoe to land, and slowly it began to taste the lagoon, to dip its high-tiered stern into the gentle waves, and finally to ride upon the bosom of Ta’aroa, which was its home.</p>

  <p class="normal">The young chiefs who would paddle the canoe that night now leaped into the two hulls and adjusted the movable seats that slid back and forth along the dugout sections. Teroro, grabbing his personal god-carved paddle, gave the canoe a mighty shove that sent it far into the lagoon, with him trailing his feet aft in the green waters. “Hoist sail!” he cried. “We’ll test the wind.” And when a noonday breeze dropped down from the cliff, it caught the sail and began to move the great double-hulled canoe, and men paddled briskly, and soon with lightning speed Wait-for-the-West-Wind hurtled across its home lagoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">It flew like a special albatross, just dipping into the waves. It went like the wind-caught leaf of a breadfruit tree, skimming the waters. It went like a young woman hurrying to meet her lover, like the essence of the god Ta’aroa majestically inspecting the ramparts of his ocean. It sped like the spirit of a warrior killed in battle, on its swift journey to the everlasting halls of Tane. And it flashed across the lagoon like what it was: a miraculous, slim, double-hulled craft of Bora Bora, the swiftest ship the world at that time had ever known, capable of doing thirty knots in bursts, ten knots for days at a time, hour after hour; a huge, massive craft seventy-nine feet long, with a tiered stern twenty-two feet high and a solid platform slung across the hulls on which forty men or the statues of forty gods could ride, with pigs and pandanus and water stowed safely in the hidden innards.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait for the west wind,” the men who built the canoe had advised, “for it blows strong and sure from the heart of the hurricane.” The north wind cannot be depended upon, and the east wind is no treasure, for it blows constantly, and the south wind brings nothing but irritating minor storms, never those that shake the earth, not storms that last for weeks at a time and which can be counted upon to drive a canoe to the farthest points of earth. Wait for the west wind! It blows from the heart of the hurricane. It is a wind to match this great canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">On this day, it was an ordinary eastern wind. Some of the world’s sailors might even have counted it a considerable breeze, but to Bora Borans who longed for the westerly gale that could carry them even to distant Nuku Hiva, the day’s wind was really nothing. But it did bear a hint of invitation, and so on the spur of the moment Teroro cried, “Through the reef!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Wait-for-the-West-Wind was already doing better than fifteen knots, and a prudent navigator usually took his craft through this perilous reef at slowest speed, but on this sun-swept day Teroro shot his precious craft directly at the small opening that marked the dividing line between the placid green waters of the lagoon and the thundering blue ocean which pounded outside.</p>

  <p class="normal">The canoe seemed to anticipate the impending crash of giant waves, for it tensed in the wind, cut a little deeper into the lagoon, and leaped toward the passageway through the reef. For an instant the crew could glimpse cruel fingers of gray coral clutching at the defiant craft, but this danger was quickly forgotten, for ahead loomed the towering waves.</p>

  <p class="normal">With a song crying from its sail, with vigor to match that of the young chiefs who manned it, the swift canoe shot into the combers, lost its nose in a great gray-blue wave, then rose triumphantly onto the crest and sped away into the very center of the wind and the rousing waves and vast blue sea of Ta’aroa.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What a canoe” Teroro exulted, the spray whipping his black hair about his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with special exhilaration that the thirty paddlers tasted the last moments of freedom with which Teroro had provided them, for each man knew that at nightfall he would embark upon a different journey: solemn, joyless, with the constant threat of death impending. In their imagination they could see the altar where the blood would be. They could visualize the dreadful sacrificial clubs. But worse, each man knew positively that when Wait-for-the-West-Wind touched Havaiki’s shore at dawn tomorrow one of today’s crew would be struck down forever.</p>

  <p class="normal">So in the day’s bright sunlight, with spume about them and the sound of sea birds, they experienced momentary joy as they drove their swift canoe, champion of the islands, with the assurance that only competent men ever know. To their wishes, the canoe responded; to their efforts it leaped forward; and now as they turned it in the free and joyous ocean, it responded as they willed, exactly to the inch as they intended, and found once more the opening through the reef, and came at last to shore. How competently these island men had built and mastered their canoe; how securely it obeyed their will.</p>

  <p class="normal">BY <span>NIGHTFALL</span> Wait-for-the-West-Wind had assumed a much different aspect. The upswept sterns were decorated with flowers and pennants of yellow tapa. The permanent platform which held the two hulls together was covered with polished planks. At the forward end stood an ultra-sacred grass-thatched temple, toward which a solemn procession of priests in sacerdotal attire now moved in dread silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest, clad in white and with a fringe of shark’s teeth about his ankles, a skullcap of red feathers on his black hair, proceeded to the grass temple and paused, at which all Bora Borans, king and slave alike, fell to the ground and hid their faces, for what was about to occur was too sacred for even a king to behold.</p>

  <p class="normal">The feather-figured statue of Oro himself, woven of sennit and with sea shells as eyes, was about to be placed inside the temple for its journey to Havaiki. From his white robes the High Priest produced a wrapping of ti leaves, which hid the god, and holding the bundle high above him he prayed in terrifying voice, then kneeled and placed the god inside the temple. He moved back, struck the canoe with his staff and cried, “Wait-for-the-West-Wind, take thy god safely to Havaiki!”&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">The prostrate crowd rose, no man speaking, and the paddlers assumed the positions they had held earlier that day. Next the seers of the island, old men of wisdom, stepped onto the polished platform wearing solemn brown tapa and skullcaps edged with dog s teeth. Some carried gourds with which to divine portents, while others studied the dying sun for auguries which they shared with no one.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro, robed in yellow and wearing a warrior’s helmet of feathers and shark’s teeth, took his place in the prow, while the king, in precious yellow robes which covered his ankles, stood amidships. Silence resumed, and the High Priest announced that he was ready to accept the sacrifices.</p>

  <p class="normal">Servants of Oro came forth with palm fronds which they spread in careful patterns, aft of the temple, and on these were laid strange gifts: a large fish from the lagoon, a shark caught at sea, a turtle taken on a special island, and a pig that had from birth been dedicated to Oro. These four dead sacrifices were not placed side by side, but about eighteen inches apart, and were promptly covered with additional palms.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, at the last moment, priests led forth the eight human sacrifices, and the people of Bora Bora, in awful silence, watched their neighbors depart for the last time. They saw the steersman who had been trapped praying to the old god Tane. And the man who had dozed in the temple. And the tardy lookout, and the sleepy young courtier. With grief the citizens watched them go. They were followed by four slaves, those unspeakable, untouchable things, known even in life as foul corpses.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the intended victims were shoved aboard, the wife of one of the slaves, if a slave’s woman could be so dignified, uttered a piercing scream. “Auwe! Auwe!” she lamented, reciting that heart-tearing word of the islands that has always been reserved for moments of supreme anguish.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her outcry was such an appalling breach of discipline, especially on the part of a slave, that all in the canoe shivered with apprehension at such an evil omen. Teroro thought: “Now our island is truly disgraced. The king will surely be sacrificed.” King Tamatoa thought: “The High Priest will have a right to be outraged. My brother is doomed.” The thirty paddlers thought: “They may have to sacrifice two of us tomorrow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest thought nothing. He was too astonished by this infraction of the tabu to do anything but point his staff at the offending woman, whereupon four priests grabbed her, rushed her to the lagoon, and pinioned her head under water. But with demonic strength the slave broke loose from their grasp, got her head free, and wailed prophetically: “Auwe! Auwe, Bora Bora!”</p>

  <p class="normal">A priest struck her in the face with a rock, and when she staggered backward, two other priests leaped upon her and held her under the water until she died. But this did not compensate for the broken tabu, and the High Priest cried, “Whose woman was she?” Someone pointed to one of the slaves in the canoe, and the High Priest nodded slightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Swiftly, from the rear of the platform a burly priest, custodian of this job for many years, stepped forward and with a mighty swing of a knobbed war club crushed the skull of the unsuspecting slave. The body slumped, but before its blood could stain the canoe, it was pitched head-first into the lagoon, where the swimming priests gathered it up as a sacrifice for their local altar. Automatically, from the shore, a substitute slave was whisked aboard, and amid such disasters and ominous portents, Wait-for-the-West-Wind headed out to sea. This time, as if sharing the guilt that had settled upon the passengers, the canoe did not spring lightly toward the reef but moved reluctantly, so that by the time the stars had risen for Teroro to steer by, Wait-for-the-West-Wind had covered only a small portion of its gloomy journey to the temple of Oro on the island of Havaiki.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward dawn, when the constellation which astronomers in other parts of the world had long since named the Lion was rising in the east, the seers whose responsibility it was to determine such things, sagely agreed that the time was near. The High Priest was consulted, and he confirmed the fact that the red-tipped hour of dawn, sacred to Oro, was at hand. He nodded, and a huge, slack-headed drum was struck in slow rhythm, sending its cry far out to sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">The rest of the world was silent. Even the lapping waves and birds who customarily cried at dawn were supposed to cease their murmuring at the approach of dread Oro. There was only the drum, until, as night paled and red streamers rose in the east, Teroro caught the sound of another drum, and then a third, far in the distance. The canoes, still invisible to one another, were beginning to assemble for the solemn procession into the channel of Havaiki. Now the drums increased their beat, until a vast throbbing was set up—hammering, hammering—and the red dawn increased, and over the silent sea one could begin to spot tall sails and mournful pennants hanging in the breezeless air. The High Priest moved his hands faster, and the drummers speeded their beat, and the paddlers began to move the canoe, always in silence, toward the gathering place, and as the red sun burst from its pit in the horizon, eleven canoes, brilliant in color and sacrificial gifts, stood forth and formed two majestic lines, each headed for the temple of Oro; but as they moved and as Teroro studied them carefully, he concluded with satisfaction: “No one has a canoe like ours.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The drums abruptly stopped, and the High Priest began an agitated chant, into the middle of which a terrifying, inhuman sound intruded: it was the frenzied beating of a very long, small-headed drum which gave an anguished cry, and as it rose to its climax, the High Priest screamed, and the burly executioner swung his studded club and crushed the head of the tall young courtier who had slept when he should have been awake.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reverently, priestly attendants caught the corpse while others removed the palms that had covered the earlier sacrifices: the fish, the shark, the turtle and the pig, It now became obvious why spaces eighteen inches wide had been left between these offerings, for into the first gaping slot was carefully fitted the dead body of the courtier.</p>

  <p class="normal">The chanting resumed and the dreadful drum began a new lament for the feckless lookout. The club fell with great fury, and the body was tenderly slipped in between the shark and the turtle. Three more times the frenzied little drum was beaten, and in the red light of dawn the awful club crashed down upon some head, so that when day commenced, the fore part of the platform was filled with Bora Bora’s diocesan statue of Oro, wrapped in ti leaves and wreathed in golden feathers, surveying the five fresh human sacrifices that lay interspersed with the fish, the shark, the turtle and the pig. Each of the other ten canoes, their wild drums wailing, had offered identical sacrifices, and all now moved the last half mile to the temple..</p>

  <p class="normal">The travelers in Wait-for-the-West-Wind had varied thoughts they approached the sacred landing, but on one thing all agreed: was reasonable for a god to require special sacrifices on days of particular solemnity, and as for the customary four slaves, no one was concerned about their deaths, especially since one of their congregation had broken a tabu so shamelessly. Slaves were ordained for sacrifice.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest reasoned, in these last minutes, that considering Bora Bora s stupid persistence in allegiance to Tane the more sacrifices made to Oro the better, particularly when one of them happened to be yesterday’s steersman, a man notoriously dedicated to Tane. “Weed them out, root and branch,” he muttered to himself. He did not consider the five men so far sacrificed an unusual number, nor did he think that the four more who were marked for sure death, nor the slave and his wife, nor the chance ones that would be killed at the convocation itself exceeded a reasonable limit. Oro was a powerful god. He had accomplished what no other god before him had attained: the consolidation of all the islands; it was only appropriate that he be honored. Prayers, respect and observance of tabus had always been accorded all gods, but a master god like Oro merited supreme sacrifices like sharks and men. Far from feeling that a quota of nine was excessive, he was already dreaming of the time when Bora Bora could invade some outward island and return with thirty or forty captives to be offered up at one sublime ceremonial “We must impress the islands,” he mused.</p>

  <p class="normal">King Tamatoa’s thoughts were different. To be sure, he felt no regret or responsibility for the death of his tardy lookout and his one-time courtier. They had failed, and death was customarily the penalty for failure. Nor could he lament in any way the four foul corpses; slaves were born to be sacrificed, but he was personally ashamed that one of his slaves had been so weak as to cry out merely because her man was being taken to Oro. Tamatoa looked upon a reasonable number of sacrifices as the simplest way of obtaining a steady flow of mana, but he nevertheless felt considerable uneasiness over the fact that the total of sacrifices for any given convocation had now been established as nine, plus more perhaps according to the chances of the day. Bora Bora was not a large island. Its men were numbered, and if in the past they had maintained their freedom it was because of their superior courage. The king wondered: “Is this sudden conversion to Oro a device by the wise men of Havaiki whereby they can depopulate my island and thus accomplish by guile what they have always been unable to do by battle? He was deeply perplexed by a further haunting possibility: “Do you suppose the priests at Havaiki are teasing our High Priest along with promises of promotion only until such time as he has disposed of Teroro and me?” Then, for the first time he expressed in words his real perplexity: “It is very difficult to be king when the gods are changing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro saw things more simply. He was outraged. His thoughts were forthright and purposeful. The death of slaves he could condone, for that was the law of the world, on every island. But to execute for trivial reasons the best fighters on Bora Bora, merely to appease a new god, was obviously wrong and disastrous. “Look at the body of Terupe, lying there between the shark and the turtle! He was the best steersman I ever had. And the High Priest knew it. And Tapoa, useless beside the shark. He was wise and would have made a good counselor.” Teroro was so furious that he did not trust himself to look either at his brother or at the High Priest, lest he uncover his thoughts. Instead, he contented himself with staring ahead at the impressive canoes and listening to the mournful drums, speaking of death. He thought: “Unless we settle the High Priest now, these drums are the requiem of Bora Bora.” He saw clearly that the death of eight or ten more key warriors would lay the island open to assault. “I’ll work out a plan,” he swore to himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">The minor priests looked with some satisfaction upon the sacrifices already consummated and those about to occur. With the advent of Oro, each priest had faced an inner struggle: “Shall I go over to the new god, or shall I remain faithful to Tane?” It was gratifying to know that one had chosen the winner. The priests acknowledged that there remained some dissidence in the island, but they had observed that after each convocation, adherence to Tane weakened. “Sacrifices help us attract the attention of Oro,” they rationalized, “and then he sends us mana.” Their conclusions were influenced perhaps by the fact that as priests they could be reasonably sure that they would not be sacrificed to obtain mana; their role in the upcoming ceremonies was simple and known: to hoist the sacrifices into place, to eat the sacrificial roast pig, also the boiled bananas, the baked taro and the salted fish. And when the convocation ended, they had to throw the human bodies into the sacred pit. There was an exhilaration about Oro that other gods did not have, and they felt gratified that they had been among the first to join his side.</p>

  <p class="normal">The thirty rowers had only one thought: “Will it be I?”</p>

  <p class="normal">And the three remaining slaves had no thoughts . . . none, that is, that would have been remotely comprehensible to the non-slaves in the canoe; for curiously, these three men, even though each had known from birth that he was doomed, had exactly the same fears, the same sick feeling beneath their hearts, and the same unaccustomed sweat in their armpits as did the men who were not slaves. But this would never have been believed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The palpitations of the slaves did not continue long, for on the instant that Teroro touched his canoe onto the beach of Havaiki, the burly priest flashed his brutal club and killed first one, then two, then three. Their bodies were pitched onto the runway up which the canoe was to be drawn, and soon every passenger who had come in the canoe, even the king and the High Priest, bent himself to the hallowed task of hauling the mighty craft ashore and onto a small plateau where it would be consecrated for the coming year.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the precise moment when the canoe came to rest, the High Priest whirled in the morning sunlight and dipped his staff toward one of Teroro’s most trusted companions, and before the man could move, the awful club descended and his skull was cleft in two. His body was strung from the stem to stand guard during the ceremonial days. The surviving crewmen, aghast at the rank of the man who had been slain, tried in deepest shame to prevent the thought that rose to their hearts: “It was not I.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The convocation was planned to last three days, during which no sound but the problems of priests should be heard. Assemblies took place in an extensive, roofless rock temple perched on a magnificent plateau overlooking the ocean across which the participating canoes had come. It was a low, sprawling edifice paved with blocks of black lava, from which even blades of grass had been swept. At one end an inner temple, thatched with palm, had been constructed, and in it reposed the ark which housed the holy of holies, the ultimate statue of Oro.</p>

  <p class="normal">The exposure of this source-god, the essential being of Oro himself, was so solemn an undertaking that not even kings or their brothers could witness the ceremony; they were excluded during the first august meeting when Oro was taken from his ark.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were, however, witnesses. From each canoe the five human sacrifices had been hauled to the temple, plus five from Havaiki itself, and had been stacked in a pile for Oro’s approval. When through his highest priest pro granted assent—the priest-as-man thinking: “It’s impressive, seeing so many bodies at once. Proves the islands are beginning to demonstrate their love for Oro”—lesser priests stepped forward and engaged in one of the convocation’s most solemn rituals.</p>

  <p class="normal">With long bone needles, threaded with golden sennit, they pierced the left eardrum of each corpse, thrust the needle on through the dead brain, and jerked the sennit out through the right ear. Then, fashioning a long loop, they strung each of the sixty corpses onto trees surrounding the temple, and for the succeeding hours these sacrificial men were free to gaze with dead eyes upon what not even kings could witness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa was required to sit apart with his brother kings, absolutely silent for seven hours, for spies supervised the kings to note any who failed in just homage to Oro, but in truth this was not necessary, for the twelve kings appreciated that their divinity derived from some august ultimate source beyond themselves, and their reservoirs of mana required constant replenishment through sacrifice and prayer. The world itself, in terrified silence, now paid reverence as mana flowed into both island statues and island kings.</p>

  <p class="normal">The temple grounds were not entirely silent, and had this fact been ascertained by spies, those who were secretly breaking this tabu would have been instantly sacrificed; but Teroro knew this, and for his hushed conversations with his twenty-nine remaining crewmen he had chosen a remote glade ringed by palms.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are we willing to speak with frankness?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What risk do we run?” a fiery young chief named Mato asked. “If we talk they will kill us. If we remain silent . . .” He bashed his fist into his hand. “Let’s talk.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why should so many of our men be given to Oro?” another asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro listened to the complaints and then said, “I have been willing to run the risk of getting you here, because it doesn’t matter whether there’s a spy among us or not.” He stared at each of his men and continued: “If one of you is a spy, inform the High Priest, because that will scare him from carrying out what I think is his plan. If no one betrays us, we’re even better off.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is your plan?” Mato, from the north side of Bora Bora, asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro held a small length of sennit, which he twisted and untwisted, saying slowly, “I think the High Priest intends to offer our king as a supreme sacrifice to Oro. He wants to impress the other priests with his control over Bora Bora. But he’s got to give the signal himself, because if he kills by stealth, where would be his political advantage? So we must watch the High Priest constantly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young chiefs sat silent, because whatever Teroro divulged as his plan was bound to involve maximum danger. Then a lesser noble pointed out: “It isn’t today we have to worry about.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s right,” Teroro agreed. “Today they’re occupied.” And he indicated the ghastly circle of dead men dancing in trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what about the general meeting tomorrow?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro untwisted the sennit and nodded judiciously. “If I were the High Priest,” he said, “with his plans, I’d strike tomorrow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Mato was in reckless mood, for during an awful moment that morning he had felt sure that the High Priest was going to nominate him as the skull-split guardian of the canoe. He said sternly, “I think that if the priest even begins to point at Tamatoa, we must surround the king and fight our way to the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I think exactly the same thing,” Teroro said abruptly.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long silence as the other twenty-eight men contemplated what such a bold step involved, but before any could turn away in cowardice Teroro threw down the sennit and spoke rapidly: “To succeed we must insure three things. First, we must somehow move our canoe to the top of the hill so that we can rush it into the water without cutting down our speed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll take care of that,” Hiro the steersman promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro liked his honest answer but nevertheless pushed his face to within a few inches of the steersman’s. “You know that if the canoe is not in position, we will all die?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I do,” the young chief said grimly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Next,” Teroro said, “we must have two very determined men sitting on the rocks at the temple exit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Brash Mato cried, “I’m one, and I want Pa for the other.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A wiry shark-faced man with no chin, Pa, the Fortress, stepped forward and announced: “I’m the other.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You may not escape,” Teroro warned them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll escape,” Mato swore. “Men of Havaiki have never . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The third requirement,” Teroro said impatiently, “is that each of the rest of us be prepared to kill instantly anyone who moves toward Tamatoa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We know the executioners,” Pa growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And once we make a move, we must sweep Tamatoa up and with an unbroken rush get him to the canoe.” He paused and then added softly, “It sounds dangerous, but once we are seaborne, Wait-for-the-West-Wind will be our safeguard.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They will never catch us,” the steersman promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And if they did, what could they do?” Mato boasted, and as the men talked it was apparent that all wished they were in the certainty of the canoe and not in the temple grounds of Oro, which were alien and unknown.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This will be the signal,” Teroro said. “You will watch me, and the moment I move to defend the king, the steersman must dash for the canoe and you men must see that he gets through the exit.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who will disarm the executioner?” Mato asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will,” Teroro said coldly. Then, to inspire his men, he boasted, “No club will fall tomorrow swifter than my arm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The men appreciated this assurance, but Mato killed their ardor by stating, “There is one grave fault in this plan.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Teroro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yesterday, before we sailed, Marama took me aside and said, ‘My husband is sure that the High Priest plans to kill the king. But I am certain that Teroro himself is the target.’ I think your wife is right. What do we do if she is?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro could not reply. He could see only his patient, worried wife moving among the men, enlisting their promises to protect him. He looked at the ground, recovered the sennit he had been twisting, and placed it in his belt. It was shark-faced Pa who spoke. “Marama spoke to me, too,’’ he said, “and our duty is clear. If they strike at the king, everything goes as planned. But if they strike at Teroro, you, Mato, with your men save the king and I with mine will rescue Teroro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am not the important one,” Teroro said honestly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To us you are,” his men replied, and they proceeded with their plans.</p>

  <p class="normal">But there was a mind at work that night much keener than either Mato’s or Pa’s, and it belonged to the High Priest. During the most solemn part of the convocation he had been thinking, and when great Oro was returned to the ark, the High Priest called his assistants to him, and they sat cross-legged in a shadowy corner of the great temple, with the bodies of men dancing above them in the night air.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have you noticed anything today?” he began.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Only that you are right,” a young priest reported. “Teroro is our mortal enemy.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What makes you say that?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“As you directed, I studied him constantly. Four separate times I caught him struggling against the will of Oro, terrible be the name.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“When?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Principally, when the king’s courtier was slain. He drew back, markedly.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought so, too,” the High Priest agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“And when one of his crew was sacrificed to guard the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He did?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And it seemed to me that when it came time for Teroro to lead the king away from the temple, while we came in, he acted joyously rather than in sorrow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We thought so, too,” several priests chorused.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what confirms it is that this afternoon Teroro must have held some kind of meeting with his men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is that correct?” the High Priest snapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I can’t be sure, because as you know, I had to leave him when we entered the temple, but immediately after Oro was returned to the ark, I slipped out to check on our men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did you find?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing. They had vanished.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How could they?” the High Priest demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know, but they had vanished.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was the king with them?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the spy reported. “He sat properly with the other kings.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Can we be sure that Teroro&#160; held&#160; a meeting?&#160; If we were sure . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I searched everywhere,” the young spy insisted, “and in my own heart I am sure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For a long time the High Priest contemplated this unwelcome news, fingering his staff and driving it into the ground. Finally he mused: “If we could be certain that a meeting was held, we could eliminate the entire canoe. We would …” But when he weighed all consequences he apparently decided against this, for he suddenly turned to his burly executioner and said softly, “Tomorrow I don’t want you at any time to stand either near the king or near Teroro. Keep completely away. You, Rere-ao,” and he addressed his spy, “are you as swift of club as you once were?” “I am.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are to place yourself inconspicuously so that at an instant’s signal you can kill Teroro. You are to watch him constantly. If he makes even the slightest move. Anything . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do I wait for a signal from you?” Rere-ao asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, but as you strike I will point at him, and his dead body will be sacred to Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest moved on to discuss their roles with others, but he soon returned to Rere-ao and asked, “You understand? You don’t wait for a signal. You kill him if he moves.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest concluded his meeting with a long prayer to Oro, at the end of which he told his men, “One way or another, tomorrow will see Bora Bora finally delivered to Oro. The old gods are dead. Ore lives.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His assistant priests breathed deeply with excitement, for their struggle to implant their new god on the backs of Tane and Ta’aroa had not been easy, and for several months they had longed for some positive event of magnitude to assure them that they had won. Their leader, sensing this desire for the spectacular, cautioned them: “There are many roads to ultimate victory, my brothers. Oro has many paths by which he can travel to triumph. Tomorrow one of them will result in his final capture of Bora Bora, but you must not anticipate which one. That is up to Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With this the High Priest folded his hands, took off his skullcap, and inclined his head toward the inner sanctuary of Oro. His fellow priests did likewise, and in the deep silence of the night, dimly lit by distant fires and the glow of shimmering stars, the holy men prayed to their all-powerful god. It was a solemn moment at the end of an exciting day, a moment sweet and meaningful, with the essence of immortality hovering above the assembly, the sacrifices in place, great Oro brooding over his faithful, and all the world subdued in silent reverence to him. At such a moment, with the greatness of Oro pulsing in the night and throbbing in the veins more powerfully than the beat of a drum, it was incomprehensible to the priests that anyone should cling to old gods when the new deity was so powerful, so rational and so benevolent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next morning Hiro the steersman was up early, and with a sharp rock hidden in tapa he slashed several of the sennit strands that bound Wait-for-the-West-Wind together, shuddering with regret as he did so, then burying the rock and hurrying to the priest in charge of the canoe’s welfare to announce: “We must have scraped coral.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The priest hurried to the canoe, which rested under the surveillance of the dead crewman lashed to the stern, and studied the broken sennit. “It can be mended with fresh cord,” he said, hoping to get the accident repaired before the High Priest blamed him for it.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the crewman agreed, “and we ought to do it while we are all under the protection of Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Such sentiment charmed the priest, and he was therefore receptive when Hiro suggested, “Wouldn’t it be easier to drag the canoe out here, where the sun can tighten the new sennit?’ And they edged the canoe into the exact position Teroro required.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will the mending take long?” the priest asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Hiro assured him. “I mustn’t miss the convocation of Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You must not,” the priest agreed, recalling the High Priest’s assurances of the night before that on this day Oro would consolidate his victory over Bora Bora, and it seemed a good omen that Hiro, one of Teroro’s prominent supporters, had thus voluntarily signified his affection for Oro.</p>

  <p class="normal">The convocation began with a startling scene, so that all who later reviewed the day agreed that it had been doomed from the beginning, although at the time that was not apparent, since the priests had quickly converted an error into a blessing. The assembly had seated itself on rocks stretching out from the main altar, and the first two pigs were being disemboweled when a boy of seven came running into the temple, crying for his father who sat near the altar. “Father!” the lost little child shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">The man, a lesser chief of Havaiki, looked in horror at the approach of his son, for the boy had committed so vast a sin that no excuse could pardon it. No woman, or child, or animal had ever strayed into the temple, and the father’s arms trembled as he gathered the handsome little fellow to his heart. “I was looking for you, Father,” the lost child whimpered. In austere silence the priests at the altar, their sacrifices to Oro interrupted, stared at the offending child. His father, aware of the tabu his family had broken, rose haltingly with the boy still in his arms. Suddenly, in an act of total dedication, he thrust his son toward the altar, the child’s hair falling over his father’s strong left arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">With anguished but unfaltering conviction the man spoke: “Take this child and sacrifice him to Oro! For the consecration of the temple has been broken by him, the thread of our union with Oro has been entangled. He is my son. I begat him. But I do not weep in losing him, for he has outraged Oro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At first the priests ignored the man and left him standing with the boy in his arms while with haughty indifference they finished slaughtering the pigs. Then, with fresh blood for Oro on their hands, two priests picked up a pair of stout bamboo rods. Holding one pair of ends rigidly together, they opened the others and formed a giant pincers which they deftly dropped over the child’s head, one bamboo catching him at the nape of the neck, the other across the throat. With remorseless force they closed the pincers and held the little boy aloft until he strangled. Then, with one swift slash, the High Priest laid open the child’s stomach and ripped out the entrails, placing the body reverently on the highest altar, between the pigs. “This father does well,” the priest droned. “All do well who honor Oro. Great Oro, bringer of peace.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The incident unnerved Teroro, because he recognized it as an omen for this faithful day, but how to interpret it was beyond him, and for a moment in his perplexity he forgot his brother whom he had come to protect. “What could such an omen signify?” he asked stubbornly, but no answer was forthcoming, so he breathed deeply and attended to his business; yet when he looked across the temple square toward the steersman Hiro, to check the man’s position, he came upon a second omen which had to be interpreted as ominous: the present steersman sat directly under the swaying body of the earlier steersman who had been killed at the whim of the High Priest, and the corpse’s distended belly, already disintegrating in the tropical heat, hung heavy over Teroro’s accomplice.</p>

  <p class="normal">In confusion Teroro dismissed all omens and watched first the High Priest and then the king, for he was totally resolved to defy Oro, even if it had to be done in the very seat of the red god’s omnipotence. But he was not prepared for the High Priest’s strategy, for while Teroro was anticipating an entirely different tactic, the priest suddenly whirled and pointed his staff at one of the least offensive members of Teroro’s crew, and one of the finest warriors.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He ate of the sacred pig of Oro!” the accuser shouted, but the young chief did not know why he died, for the burly executioner had anticipated the charge and had already crushed the man’s skull.</p>

  <p class="normal">Priests from other islands, gratified that Oro was being protected from apostasy, chanted: “All-powerful is Oro, the peace-giver, Oro of the united islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As they continued their droning, Teroro sat stunned. The young chief had been his special friend, an unassuming warrior who could not possibly have eaten sacred pig. Why had he been sacrified? Teroro could not focus upon the problem. He had a fine plan to protect King Tamatoa, and he knew that if he himself were menaced, Mato would save him. But he had not foreseen the High Priest’s clever assault upon lesser members of the Bora Bora community.</p>

  <p class="normal">In dismay Teroro looked at the steersman, who stared with equal dismay at him. No answer was available there, so Teroro tried to catch the eyes of Mato and Pa, at the exit, but they were obsessed by the altar, where the body of their companion now lay. The other members of Teroro’s plot were equally stunned, and in mounting confusion their leader stared at the polished rocks which formed the platform on which they had convened.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of the Bora Bora contingent, only one man saw clearly in these awful moments. Tamatoa, like many successful kings, was gifted not with marked intellectual ability but with a powerful, stolid insight; and he realized that the High Priest had determined not to assassinate Tamatoa and his brother, but to drive them from the islands by irresistible pressure, constantly applied. “He will avoid a direct confrontation,” the king reasoned. “There will be no battle. Patiently and with cunning he will alienate and terrify my people, and we will have to go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa was confirmed in his analysis when the High Priest whirled his staff of death at another member of Teroro’s crew, and the terrible club of death descended once more. Sick at heart, King Tamatoa looked at his younger brother and saw Teroro befuddled and distraught. The king thought: “He probably had some grandiose plan to save my life today, and probably the High Priest had spies who told him the whole plot. Poor young man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In his compassion, the king kept his eyes fixed on his brother until, bedazed, the latter looked up. Almost imperceptibly the older man shook his head, cautioning his brother not to act, not in any way. Teroro, catching the message, sat numb in fury.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this moment, in the sacred temple of Oro, with the bodies of his finest men dangling before him and strewn upon the altar, that King Tamatoa whispered in his heart: “Oro, you have triumphed. You are the ultimate god, and I am powerless to oppose you.” When he had said these words of contrition, a great peace came over him and he saw, as if in a revealing vision, how foolish he had been to combat the will of the inevitable. New gods were being born, and new gods conquer; but what Tamatoa did not realize was that the contentment of soul which his confession induced was merely the prerequisite for a decision toward which he had been fumbling for some months, but from which he had always hitherto retreated. Now that he had accepted the obvious—that Oro had conquered—the next obvious conclusion was easy to reach, and in the stillness of the morning Tamatoa said the fatal words for the first time, and in uttering them an enormous burden was lifted from his heart: “We will depart from Bora Bora and leave it to you. Oro. We will go upon the sea and find other islands where we can worship our own gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">During the rest of the convocation, King Tamatoa did not confide his decision to anyone, not even to Teroro. In fact, he avoided his hot-headed younger brother, but he did summon Mato, to whom he spoke harshly: “I hold you responsible for my brother’s life, Mato. If he has plots afoot, I am sure you are part of them. He must not die, even if you have to tie him to the canoe. He must not die. I need him now more than ever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So when Teroro convened his bewildered companions to dream up some new fantasy, Mato spoke first: “We must go back to Bora Bora and plan our revenge.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ll go back and work out a plan,” shark-faced Pa seconded.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the decision taken from his hands Teroro could only mutter, “We will have revenge! That we will have!” and thinking only of some utter destruction and disaster, he bided his time.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN</span> A <span>CONVOCATION</span> ended, the priests wisely withdrew and encouraged the population to release its tensions in a wild, spontaneous celebration that sometimes lasted for three days. Now women were free to join their men, and musicians crowded the night with echoes. Beautiful girls, flashing bits of brown radiance dressed in skirts of aromatic leaves, swept into the mad hula of Havaiki and danced provocatively before the visitors of other islands, as if to challenge: “Do the women of Tahiti have soft breasts like ours? Can they move their knees to music the way we can?”</p>

  <p class="normal">One spectator watched the dances and muttered to himself, “May the women of Havaiki be damned.” Teroro would take no part in the celebration. Neither the magic hammering of the excited drums, nor the sweet voices of older women chanting love songs, nor the beauty of the girls enticed him to join the dancers. When special beauties, their bodies illuminated by palm-frond torches and etched in smoke from the fires where pigs roasted, danced past him in direct invitation, he would look at the ground and mutter to himself, “I will destroy this island. I will kill every priest of Oro. I will desolate . ..”</p>

  <p class="normal">His men could not maintain such powerful resolve. One by one the young chiefs threw aside their spears, wiped their hands on their bare chests and leaped into the dancing circle, shouting and entering into the wild gyrations of the Havaiki hula. When they had driven themselves into an ecstasy, they would leap high into the air, slap their thighs and prance for a moment before their equally frenzied partners. Then each would pause, look at the other, and break into laughter, whereupon the girl would unconcernedly start to walk idly toward the shadows, her partner following with equal unconcern until at the last they gave a cry and rushed together to the seclusion of some protected glade.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they disappeared, old women in the chanting circle were free to shout encouragement, usually of the grossest kind, at which the general audience roared with approval.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’ll be tired before she is!” one old woman predicted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Show him what Havaiki’s famous for, Rere,” another screamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t let him stop till he begs for mercy,” the first added.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe!” another cried. “Make the moon hide its face for shame!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Remember what I taught you, Rere!” the first chanter shouted. “Don’t make him do all the work.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the advice became almost unbearably clinical, the general audience collapsed into gales of merriment, the music halted, and everyone rolled about the earth in animal joy. What delight the wildness of sex brought with it. Then the tiniest drum—no more than eight inches of hollowed-out branch beaten with a wand—would begin a wild, high rhythm that could almost compel a man to dance, and larger drums would pick it up, and soon some other of Teroro’s men would begin dancing with a dark Havaiki girl and they too would go into the shadows accompanied by ribald advice from the lusty old women, for an island hula was meaningless unless at its climactic moment a man and woman so desired each other that they were propelled explosively into fulfillment.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro alone was not captured by the mystery and joy of this night. He did not even look up when the leading heckler shouted, “I always thought there was something wrong with the men of Bora Bora. Tetua, dance over there and tell me is he’s capable!” A marvelous young girl of fifteen danced almost on Teroro’s toes, flashing her body very close to his. When he ignored her, she ran laughing into the middle of the fire-rimmed circle and shouted, “He can’t do!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old woman cackled above the drums, “I keep wondering how they have babies on Bora Bora. Men from Havaiki must swim over at night!”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this sally Teroro had to look up, and against his will he had to smile at the raucous old woman, for islanders loved wit and liked to acknowledge it, even when directed against themselves. The old chanter, seeing that she had pierced Teroro’s indifference, cried passionately, “Auwe! If I were only twenty years younger, I’d explain to you what men were made for!” When the crowd roared she shouted, “I can even yet!” And she started an outrageous hula, moving toward Teroro with her white hair dancing in the night and the memory of great sexual feats animating her hips. She was prepared to make a great fool of Teroro, but at this moment a famous chief of Havaiki, fat Tatai who guarded the temple, appeared and said quietly, “We would like you to eat with us, Teroro.” And he led the young chief away from the fires, but not away from the old woman’s biting tongue, for as the two men disappeared she screamed, “Oh, now I understand. It’s men he likes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Fat Tatai laughed and said, “Only death will silence that one’s tongue.” He led Teroro to the outskirts of the village, where his imposing family grounds had for centuries been enclosed on three sides by a rock wall head-high, the fourth side free to open on the ocean. As he entered the enclosure, Teroro saw dimly eight or nine grass houses and he could identify each: the main sleeping hall, the women’s hall, the women’s cook house, and the separate houses for each of Tatai’s favorite wives. It was to the men’s area that fat Tatai took his guest, and there, in moonlight and to the music of waves, the feast was spread.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro had barely finished licking burnt pig fat from his fingers when to the west of the compound a tiny drum, beaten frantically with a length of wood, began its persuasive chatter, followed by the steadier throbbing of several big drums as the musicians entered. “I wonder why Tatai bothered to set such a feast for me?” Teroro mused, pushing away the food. He wandered to a group seated by a fire and watched casually the figures that began to materialize from the night’s soft shadows. They were the women of the Havaiki chiefs, and in tones less raucous than Teroro had recently heard in the village square, they began the haunting strains of old island love songs, and the bitterness went out of his heart:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“When the rolling surf</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And the rising moon</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And the swaying palm</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And the high white bird</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And the lazy fish</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>All speak of love,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>I cry in the night:</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Where are you, love?”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">It was to the strains of this languorous island song that Teroro saw approaching him, in the gentle rhythms of a chief’s hula, a slim, wiry-hipped girl of fourteen with midnight-black hair that fell to her knees. She swayed delicately, her dark eyes fixed on the ground, but when the plaintive old song ended, she raised her right finger about two inches from the fall of her ti-leaf skirt, shimmering in the flares, and indicated a swifter beat, which the drums initiated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now she danced on her toes, her knees and elbows out in an excitingly awkward position, with the fronds of her ti-leaf skirt whirling about her handsome legs. In this dance she allowed her face to show, and it was remarkably beautiful, and she brought it close to Teroro’s, her full young breasts almost brushing his hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Against his will Teroro gazed back at her dark eyes and for a moment was inspired to leap to his feet and join her in the dance; but he felt that he must ignore Havaiki women, since he would one day destroy this evil place. He felt no burning sexual desire, for on Bora Bora he had always been allowed almost any girl he wanted; like all young chiefs, at puberty he had been handed over to an older woman who had instructed him long and intimately in the proper behavior of men and what pleases women, and it was this preceptor who had selected his first four partners. Later, after long consultations with a genealogist, the instructress had decided that moon-faced Marama was the girl he must marry. “She will fit you appropriately in all ways,” the older woman had decided, and she was right. His subsequent girls Teroro had picked for himself, and sex had been as natural to him as swimming, so that now he was constrained to ignore the dancing girl before him, except that when he saw the look of intense disappointment on her face he felt ashamed, and against his better judgment, looked at her and smiled. And in that instant he saw her framed against palm trees, with long black tresses glistening in the fires, and on some surging impulse he leaped to his Feet, whirled into the dancing area and positioned himself before her, swinging his body in the frenzied postures of the even more erotic Bora Bora hula.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the beautiful young girl acted as if she had never seen her new partner before. Dancing impersonally, her eyes far away, she led the drums to faster rhythms until in mounting fire her entire body quivered and a soft glow of perspiration reflected from every angle of her golden brown skin. She bent her knees and danced close to the ground. Then, in the most characteristic passage of the Havaiki hula, she spread her knees as if entertaining a man in love, whereupon the drums retarded their beat to allow her movements to become slow and madly provocative. She closed her dark eyes and held her head far back. With one hand she caught the ends of her hair and passed them between her teeth.</p>

  <p class="normal">Over her a savagely aroused Teroro danced until with a fiery leap he sprang high into the air, descending with his toes not inches from hers. He now bent his body, spreading his knees, and for at least a minute the two bronzed bodies swayed until a woman shouted, “Auwe!” and the drums rose to new violence and the dancers entered upon the final wild gyrations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, magically, everything stopped. There was dead silence, and the young girl, walking slowly like a sea goddess come ashore, moved demurely toward the shadows that marked the sleeping areas of the compound. When she had vanished, Teroro with maximum indifference stooped to throw a driftwood brand into the fire. Then tardily, like a boy summoned to a temple, he started edging toward the shadows, but this was too much for one of the chief’s women, and she called in a wild, penetrating voice, “Take your skirt off, Tehani, I can’t make you another.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He found her waiting for him in the far corner of the compound, before a small house which her family had reserved for her on her thirteenth birthday, for island parents encouraged their daughters to experiment with many young men and to learn the ways of love, since potential husbands did not like to marry any girl who had not already proved that she could bear children. “This is my house,” she said simply. “What is your name?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am Tehani, Chief Tatai’s daughter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tehani,” Teroro interpreted. “The little darling.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The girl laughed nervously and replied, “My mother was beautiful.” With a swift passage of his arm about her hair-hidden waist, Teroro swept Tehani into the air and carried her into her house. Happily, she twisted her long tresses about his face and pressed her lips to his. When he had placed her on the soft pandanus mats she pulled away her skirt of ti leaves and said, “It was my mother who warned me not to tear the skirt.” And she pulled Teroro onto her and wrapped her arms about him, twisted and sought him, pressing him ever more strongly to her. But later, as he lay in the starlight that drifted in through the doorway, he swore to himself: “I will destroy this compound . . . this whole island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But in the morning, after he had eaten in the men’s house, where his adventure with Tehani occasioned no comment, he returned to the girl’s secluded house, and after a while the two lovers began idly toying with the famous Havaiki slapping game, wherein to an ancient chant each gently tapped the other’s finger tips, then shoulders, then sides, then thighs; as the game progressed the slaps grew in intensity, until perversely they dropped away to the tenderest of caresses, so that a gesture which started as a quick slap might end as a long embrace. At last Tehani lingered so gently over one slap, that Teroro caught her skirt and pulled it from her. Completely naked, she continued the game, chanting a few haphazard bars and attempting a few more desultory slaps, now grown breathless and passionate, until with a cry of soft triumph she surrendered the game and rolled into Teroro’s arms, pushing him back onto the matting.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later she whispered, “This is the way we fight on Havaiki.” When Teroro laughed she asked, “Can girls of Bora Bora fight with their men like this?” Teroro was not pleased with the question, and although Tehani sensed his irritation she nevertheless pursued: “Is it true that on tiny Bora Bora you still pray to Tane?” The manner in which she pronounced tiny and Tane betrayed the contempt with which people of her island had always regarded Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro did not rise to the insult. With studied courtesy he said, “We pray to Oro, which is why, even though we are so small, we invariably defeat Havaiki in war.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tehani blushed at the memory of her island’s humiliations and asked, “Did you wonder why my father came for you last night? And why I danced for you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I thought about it. It looked planned.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And why I brought you here?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“At first love-making a man sometimes wonders,” Teroro said. “At the second he no longer bothers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And at the third,” Tehani whispered, “he decides to stay with this girl … to make his home here … to become a man of Havaiki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro pulled away and said, “For a warrior there is only one home, Bora Bora.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was an ancient island custom that high-born women could seek their husbands, and Tehani now did so. “I plead with you, Teroro. Stay here with me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If you want to be my wife,” he said, “you’ll have to come to my island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You already have a first wife there, Teroro. Live here, and I will be your first wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The young chief held the girl off and studied her marvelous face.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why do you ask this, Tehani? You could have any man on Havaiki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The girl hesitated, then decided to speak the truth. “Your island is doomed, Teroro. You must escape. Come here. Be loyal to Oro. We can have a good life.” “Has your father suggested this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What evil is he planning?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I dare not say,” she answered. Taking Teroro’s hands, she knelt before him and pleaded softly, “I have shown you how sweet Havaiki could be because I want to save your life. Here you can become a powerful chief. My father has many lands, and Oro is generous to warriors like you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I belong to Bora Bora,” Teroro said with passionate conviction. “I will never leave that island,” and he started for the canoe, but pleading Tehani caught him by the legs, and he stayed with her that second night, so that on the next morning when the conch shells told of departure, he was reluctant to go. “There are no women like you on Bora Bora,” he confessed. “Stay here with me,” she pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment he was almost tempted into confiding to her the revenge he had been formulating in his mind, but he fought back ; the impulse and said, “If I ever did come back to Havaiki, you would be my woman. A man could enjoy you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Come soon, Teroro, for Bora Bora is doomed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Certainly, when the eleven visiting canoes departed the temple and stood out to sea, each breaking off from the column for its own destination, it seemed that the days of Bora Bora’s greatness had vanished, for it was a dispirited group that occupied Wait-for-the-West-Wind. King Tamatoa acknowledged that in the game of power at the temple, he had permanently lost. All strength now lay with the High Priest, and abandonment of the island to Oro was the only sensible course. Teroro, surveying his depleted ranks, brooded on revenge, but had to recognize that the priest had outwitted him and had stricken down enough of his men to demoralize the rest. The crewmen sensed that their chiefs were disorganized and that ultimate power now lay with the High Priest, but they did not know by what political contrivances the power would be transferred; while the junior priests were so excited by the obvious victory of Oro that they had volunteered, while still on Havaiki, to assassinate both Tamatoa and Teroro and thus to settle the island’s problems once and for all.</p>

  <p class="normal">To their surprise, the High Priest had not assented to this; in act, he had condemned his overeager assistants and had reasoned: “If we dispose of the king and his brother in this manner, the people will lament their passing and might even rise against us, but if we continue as we have been doing, then the people themselves will discover that their king is powerless against the wishes of Oro, and they will either force him to Oro’s will, or they will desert him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But what if the king is obstinate?” an old priest had asked, recalling the record of Tamatoa’s father, against whom Havaiki, Tahiti and Moorea had united in war, fruitlessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest had looked up at the sacrifices dangling in the moonlight and had observed: “Tamatoa may remain obstinate, but his people won’t. Have you been watching how his men are even now confused and bitter? Where is Teroro, their leader, right now? Idling in the hut of Tehani!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old priest, not certain that Tamatoa would abdicate, had argued: “Whom shall we select to rule Bora Bora if we do depose the king?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest had hoped that this question would not be raised, because he did not wish to stand forth among his followers as the originator of a plan that had indeed been devised by the generality of priests, so he had equivocated and said, “Oro has chosen a successor.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who?” the old man had pressed. “Oro has chosen Tehani’s father, the great chief of Tatai.” There had been a long silence as the enormity of this decision struck the priests, for they were Bora Bora bred, and what was proposed was nothing less than the submission of their island to the ruling house of Havaiki, a thing never accomplished in the past by siege or war or contrivance. The High Priest had known that this intelligence must at first be repugnant, so before anyone could speak, he had added, “It is Oro who has chosen Tatai.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The invocation of Oro’s name among men who had only recently staked their lives on this god, effectively halted comment, and the High Priest had continued: “That is why Tatai has urged his daughter Tehani to become the wife of Teroro. He will move to Havaiki and take with him most of his vigorous supporters, and they will soon become swallowed up among the men or Havaiki. Tatai, when he becomes king of Bora Bora, has agreed to leave his wives behind and to marry our women. In this way, Oro will be supreme.” He had not added that when this was accomplished, he hoped to move his own headquarters to the great temple at Havaiki, and that at such time he would take along with him those Bora Bora subordinates who most heartily supported his master plan. But none of his listeners required to be told this, and with these exciting thoughts coursing through their minds the holy men returned to Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">The twenty-seven surviving crewmen had few coherent thoughts, They had watched, helpless, while their original number was decimated by the power of Oro, and they had shared their leaders’ confusion. Contrary to what the High Priest believed, they were, gratified rather than disturbed by the fact that Teroro had spent his time with Tehani, for Mato had spread the news that Teroro must be got back to Bora Bora alive. They suspected that King Tamatoa had some solid plan of revenge, and they hoped to be a part of it. But beyond animal revenge they could not see.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was one emotion which all in the boat shared, for at the end of the day, just before entering the home lagoon, the travelers saw the sun sink toward the west, throwing rich golden lights upon their magic island, and each man, no matter what his plots, instinctively felt: “This is the beautiful island. This is the land upon which the gods have spent particular care.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For to see Bora Bora at the end of a journey, with sunset upon the peaks, with dark night drifting in upon the valleys, and with sea birds winging homeward; to see the red line of sunset climbing the mountain faces until the top was reached, and darkness, and to cry, “Hold! Hold! Let it remain day until I touch the shore!” and to catch within the lagoon the sounds of children at play and the echoes of home, while outside the reef the ocean roared—to have known Bora Bora at such a moment was to have known beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was with enhanced regret, therefore, that King Tamatoa led his brother to the palace and bade him recline on the pandanus mats, whereupon the king carefully lowered the matting walls, and when he was thus protected from spies, lay down facing Teroro. Secretly and in a low voice he delivered the striking words: “I have decided that we must leave Bora Bora.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro was stunned. He had never even contemplated such a retreat, for he still did not appreciate the untenable position into which he and his brother had been maneuvered. “Why should we leave?” he gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There is no place for us here any longer.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can fight! We can kill . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Whom shall we fight? The people? The other islands?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can do nothing, Teroro.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But where can we go?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To the north.”</p>

  <p class="normal">This simple phrase carried implications that were difficult for Teroro to digest, and as the idea climbed from one level of his consciousness to another he could only repeat his brother’s startling words. “To the north?” He recalled that other canoes had left for the north centuries before, legendary canoes which had never returned. There existed, however, a mysterious old chant which purported to give sailing directions to a distant land that lay under the Seven Little Eyes, the holy constellation whose rising launched the new year, and some said that this chant implied that at least one of the legendary canoes must have returned, and words from the chant came to his mind:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Sail to the Seven Little Eyes,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To the land guarded by Little Eyes.</em></p>

  <p class="normal">But as soon as he spoke the words he grew angry, for they conjured up a picture of him fleeing Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why should we go?” he blustered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t take refuge in empty words, Teroro,” the king snapped impatiently. “When you sailed to Nuku Hiva, did you find any certain knowledge of any of the canoes that have sailed to the north?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand there’s an old sailing chant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No one knows for sure where it came from.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it say?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If I remember, it says to sail until you come to land that lies under the Seven Little Eyes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many days?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Some men say thirty, some say fifty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teroro, if we decided to sail with the next big storm that brings us a west wind, how many people could we carry on our canoe?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would they let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If not, we would have to fight for it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Good!” Teroro grunted, for now he could begin to see specific action.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How many men?” Tamatoa pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“About sixty.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And all supplies?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Everything.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And a house for our gods?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brothers lay on the matting with their faces at arm’s length apart, whispering, and finally Tamatoa asked, “Who should join us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro quickly rattled off the names of many warriors: “Hiro, Mato, Pa . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We aren’t going to battle,” Tamatoa corrected. “We are going to the north . . . forever.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the hushed room the word overcame Teroro. “Leave Bora Bora forever?” He leaped to his feet and cried, “We’ll kill the High Priest tonight!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa grabbed him by one leg and hauled him down to the matting. “We are concerned with a great voyage, not revenge.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Teroro cried, “At the convocation I and my men were ready to fight all the islands if anyone touched you, Tamatoa. We would have strewn the temple with bodies. We feel the same way now.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa smiled and said, “But the High Priest outsmarted you, didn’t he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro pressed his fingers into a tight knot and mumbled, “How did it happen? Our plan was so good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Oro has triumphed,” the king said sadly. “We had better take our gods and go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro growled, “I should like to be set free on Havaiki one night before we go. They’d never put out the fires.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is there anyone on Bora Bora who knows the directions north?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our uncle. It was Tupuna who taught them to me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Is he loyal to Oro?” Tamatoa asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, but I think he is also loyal to you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Impossible,” Tamatoa objected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For wise old men like Tupuna, many things are possible,” Teroro laughed. “Do you want me to call him?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait. Won’t he be in session with the others?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They don’t pay much attention to him,” Teroro explained. “They suspect he’s loyal to you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We wouldn’t dare take so long a voyage without a priest,” Tamatoa said gravely. “To be alone on the ocean for fifty days . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would want a priest along,” Teroro agreed. “Who would read the omens?” And he sent a messenger to fetch old Tupuna.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the interim the brothers resumed their positions and their planning. “Can we gather all we need?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can get spears and helmets . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother!” Tamatoa cried impatiently. “For the last time, we are not going forth on some adventure. What I mean is can you get breadfruit shoots that will survive? Seed coconuts? Bred sows? And some good eating dogs? We would need a thousand fishhooks and two thousand lengths of sennit. Can you get those things?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll get them,” Teroro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Keep thinking about whom we shall take with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again Teroro rattled off the easy names and again the king interrupted: “Find a man who can make knives, one who can strip pandanus, a good fishhook man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, if we take sixty men it ought to be easy . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been counting the spaces in my mind,” Tamatoa reflected. “We can take only thirty-seven men, six slaves, and fifteen women.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Women,” Teroro gasped.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Suppose the land to the north is empty,” Tamatoa mused. “Suppose there are no women. We would watch our friends set their feet upon the rainbow, one by one, and each man as he left would be forever irreplaceable. There would be no children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you take a wife?” Teroro asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will take none of my present wives,” the king replied. “I’ll take Natabu, so that we can have royal children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll take Marama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king hesitated, then took his brother by the hands. “Marama may not go,” he said gravely. “We will take only women who can bear children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would not want to go without Marama,” the younger man said. “She is my wisdom.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am sorry, brother,” the king said with complete finality. “Only women who can bear children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then I won’t go,” Teroro said flatly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I need you,” the king replied. “Don’t you know any young girl to take?” Before Teroro could reply, the flaps parted and his uncle, old Tupuna of the white toplanot and the flowing beard, came into the palace. He was nearly seventy, a remarkable age in the islands, where a man of thirty-three like the king was already an elder, so he spoke with exceptional authority.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I come to my brother’s sons,” he said gravely, taking a seat on the matting near them. “I come to my own children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king studied the old man carefully, and then said in a low voice, “Uncle, we place our safety in your hands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In a striking voice mellowed by years and wisdom Tupuna said, “You’re planning to leave Bora Bora and want me to join you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The brothers gasped and looked about lest any spies should have lingered, but the old man reassured them. “All the priests know you’re planning to leave,” he said benevolently. “We’ve just been discussing it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we didn’t know ourselves until we entered this room an hour ago,” Teroro protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s the only sensible thing to do,” Tupuna pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will you join us?” Tamatoa asked directly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. I told the priests I was loyal to Oro, but I could not let my family depart without an intercessor with the gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We couldn’t go without you,” Teroro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will they let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the old man replied. “I pleaded for that in particular, because when I was younger I helped consecrate the trees that built this canoe. I shall be happy to have it my grave.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Your grave?” Teroro asked. “I expect to reach land! Somewhere!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“All men who set forth in canoes expect to reach land,” the old man laughed indulgently. “But of all who leave, none ever return.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teroro just told me that you knew sailing directions,” the king protested. “Somebody must have returned.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are sailing directions,” the old priest admitted. “But where did they come from? Are they a dream? They tell us only to sail to land guarded by the Seven Little Eyes. Perhaps the chant refers only to the dream of all men that there must be a better land somewhere.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we know nothing about this journey?” Tamatoa interrupted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing,” Tupuna replied. Then he corrected himself. “We do know one thing. It’s better than staying here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was silence, and then Teroro surprised the king by asking, “Have they agreed to let us take our gods, Tane and Ta’aroa?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the old man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I am glad,” Teroro said. “When a man gets right down to the ocean’s edge . . . when he is really starting on a voyage like this . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not finish, but Tupuna spoke for him. He said, in a deep prophetic voice, “Are there people where we go? No one knows. Are there fair women? No one knows. Will we find coconuts and taro and breadfruit and fat pigs? Will we even find land? All that we know, sons of my brother, sons of my heart, is that if we are in the hands of the gods, even if we perish on the great ocean, we will not die unnoticed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And&#160; we&#160; know&#160; one&#160; thing&#160; more,”&#160;&#160; the&#160; king&#160; added.&#160;&#160; “If&#160; we stay here we shall slowly, one by one, be sacrificed, and all our family and all our friends. Oro has ordained it. He has triumphed.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“May I tell the High Priest that? It will make our departure easier.” In complete humbleness of spirit, King Tamatoa replied, “You may tell him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this moment there came from the beach a sound which thrilled the three plotters, converting them at once from mature men into the children that they essentially were; and as each heard the exciting message, his eyes widened with joy and he threw off whatever badges of position he might have been wearing and ran toward the palace door, looking out into the starry darkness with the same pulsating thrill he had known as a boy.</p>

  <p class="normal">For there along the waterfront, in the midnight hour, the citizens of Bora Bora, without king or priest, had assembled with drums and nose flutes for a night of wild merriment. The apprehensions of the convocation were ended and childish revelry was again in command. Therefore, with only the rank of commoners, Tamatoa, Tupuna and Teroro hurried eagerly to the beach. A raucous old woman was yelling, as they came, “Let me show you how our great helmsman Hiro steers a canoe!” And in superb mimicry she became not an old woman with few teeth, but a malicious lampoon of young Hiro steering his canoe; in a dozen ways she caught his mannerisms: the way he looked out to sea, and his swagger; but what she steered was not the canoe’s tiller but the make-believe male genitals of another old woman who was playing the part of the canoe. When the steering was done, the first woman screamed, “He’s very smart, Hiro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The crowd bellowed, particularly when they saw Teroro applauding the vicious mimicry of his helmsman. “I’ll bet she really could steer a canoe!” he shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’d be surprised at what I could do!” the lascivious old woman replied. But the crowd left her antics and started to applaud as blunt Malo, from the other side of the island, suddenly wrapped a bit of yellow tapa about his shoulders and made believe he was fat Tatai of Havaiki, executing ridiculous steps to the music and lampooning that chief’s pompous ways. To the great joy of the assembly, King Tamatoa nimbly leaped into the smoky arena and took his place beside Malo, and both imitated Tatai, each more foolishly than his competitor, until at last it was difficult to say which was Malo and which the king. The foolish little dance ended with Tamatoa sitting exhausted in the dust, laughing madly as if he had no cares.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the crowd looked toward a new down, for shark-faced Pa had grabbed a leaf-skirt and was crying in a shrill high voice, “Call me Tehani!” And he pirouetted grotesquely but with uncanny skill, evoking the Havaiki girl, until Teroro asked himself, “How could he have seen her dance? But his preoccupation with Pa was broken when he saw his own wife, Marama, leap into the dance in hilarious burlesque of her husband. “It’s Teroro!” the crowd applauded as the skilled woman ridiculed her man, gently and with love, but also with keenest perception. As she danced Teroro wondered: “Who told her about Tehani?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama and the shark-faced man were the night’s success. Pa was so ugly and his features so preposterous that he could make them seem like those of any man; and he could be both gentle, as in his mimicry of Tehani, and savage, as in his next burlesque of the High Priest. With a bit of black tapa for a wig and a breadfruit branch for a staff, Pa gyrated furiously in demented manner, whirling about and pointing his stick at first one islander and then another. As he did so, Marama, dancing behind with a feather bag, played the burly executioner, clubbing down one victim after another.&#160; Finally, in a mock frenzy, the crazy dancer Pa gyrated directly up to King Tamatoa and pointed his stick at him, whereupon Marama rushed alongside, swung her feather bag, and brought it within an inch of the king’s face. The victim fell as if his skull had been crushed, and lay in the sand, laughing, laughing.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the long wild night progressed, every item of island life was brought under ridicule, with chinless Pa as the ringleader. He possessed what islanders loved: a child’s sense of fairy tale, and to watch his amazing pointed face move from one characterization to the next was endless joy. Toward dawn, when the fears and repressions of the past weeks were dissipated, a group of old women approached King Tamatoa and began pleading with him, obviously seeking some special boon for the people, until at last he gave assent, whereupon the delegation’s leader leaped withered-legged into the center of&#160; the crowd, screaming the good news: “Our great king says tonight we play the gourd game!” With hushed excitement the men and women separated&#160; into&#160; facing&#160; groups&#160; as&#160; King&#160; Tamatoa&#160; ceremoniously tossed toward the men a feathered gourd which glistened in the firelight. A chief reached out and caught it, danced a few ritual steps, then pitched it in a high, shimmering arc toward the eager women. A young girl who had long lusted after this man leaped into the air, snatched the gourd and dashed with it to the man who had thrown it. Clutching him by the waist, she rushed him passionately into the shadows, while the feathered gourd flew back and forth, determining the sleeping partners for that wild night.&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro, although he had the island to choose from, elected his own wife, Marama, the penetrating down, and as they lay quietly in the gray-and-silver dawn, with the timeless waves of the lagoon once more established over the night’s loud revelry, Teroro confided, “Tamatoa has decided to leave the islands.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I suspected he had reached some grave decision,” Marama said. “He was so eager to laugh.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What I don’t understand is, the High Priest has agreed to let Tupuna join us. And also to let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama explained: “He’s wise. He knows that islanders like to avoid direct conflicts that humiliate others. It’s good procedure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Her words were so in conflict with his plans for revenge that he asked, “What about the humiliation we suffered at Havaiki? Would you forget that, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would,” she said firmly. “When we’re safe on some other island we can afford to forget Havaiki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He started to explain that she would not be going on the voyage, but he could find no words to do so gracefully; in cowardice he fell asleep, but after a while he half-woke and mumbled, “You were very funny tonight, Marama. You were really wonderful.”</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN THE DECISION</span> to depart from Bora Bora was whispered from one village to the next, the island became a curious place, because no one admitted officially that the king was leaving. The High Priest continued to pay public deference to Tamatoa, and old Tupuna officiated at daily prayers to Oro. Young chiefs who had determined to join the expedition embraced wives who were obviously going to be left behind; but under this surface of indifference, all were preoccupied with one job: loading a canoe for an unknown voyage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Particular care was given to food supplies. It was relatively easy to prepare food that was going to be consumed on the voyage; it was dried in the sun and compacted into small bundles tied with ti leaves. What required special thought was the selection of roots and saplings for a new land. Experts sought taro roots that would produce the gray-blue tuber which made the best poi, and coconuts that came from the strongest trees, and breadfruit that did not grow too high but which did produce big heads rich in starch and glutinous sap. White-haired Tupuna spent three days selecting chickens that would yield meat and dogs that would bake well, for he constantly reminded his charges that they were heading for land that might be very spare, indeed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then came the day when departure could no longer be politely masked, for with a saw made from a large sea shell, Teroro boldly cut eleven feet from each of the canoe’s high sterns. “We cannot risk such high adornment on a long trip,” he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe!” cried men and women along the shore. “The great canoe of Bora Bora is being desecrated.” Gently Teroro handed down the god-carved sterns, and priests bore them to the temple. The crowd watched while he used dried shark’s skin to smooth the ends of the truncated stern, and he kept his back to the watchers as he worked, for he was praying, “Wait-for-the-West-Wind, forgive me for this mutilation,” and out of his humiliation at having to cut down his own canoe, an obsessive rage was generated which was to make departure from Bora Bora an event ever to be remembered in the islands.</p>

  <p class="normal">His rage increased when he left his deformed canoe and went to his own hut, where he threw himself on the floor and hammered the pandanus mats. Marama came to sit with him and assured him: “When we have found a new home we will find big trees and we can make new pillars for our canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No! They’ll remain as they are! A signal of our shame.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You talk like a boy,” the placid-faced woman chided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“When I was a boy,” he corrected, “if anyone insulted me, I beat him on the head. But now I’m a man, and Havaiki insults me without risks.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teroro,” his wife pleaded. “Look at it sensibly. What has Havaiki really done? They’ve invented a new god, and the world seems to prefer him. They haven’t . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro grasped his wife by the arm. “Haven’t you heard the whispers?” he asked bitterly. “When Tamatoa goes, who is to be the new king? Fat Tatai of Havaiki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama gasped. “Have they gone so far?” she asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes!” Teroro snapped. “And do you know what they had the insolence to do? They proposed that I desert my brother and leave Bora Bora. I was to marry Tatai’s daughter . . . trade places with him!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why didn’t you tell me this?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It was only now that I figured it out,” he replied sheepishly. And as always, when he felt humiliated, he decided upon a plan of swift action. “Marama,” he said hurriedly, “go across the mountain and assemble all who have agreed to paddle the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What are you planning?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To take West Wind for a trial, on the ocean. To see if the new stern works. Tell anyone who asks, that’s what we’re doing. But whisper to each man that he must also bring his best war club.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, Teroro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you want us to creep away, unavenged?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. There’s no dishonor in that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not for a woman, perhaps,” Teroro said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama considered what was involved, the possibility of death and the chance that Havaiki might send canoes in retaliation, thus ending escape to the north, but after she had considered for a long time she said, “Since men are what they are, Teroro, you ought not to go unavenged. May the gods protect you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So, toward midafternoon two days before the intended departure for Nuku Hiva, and while a good wind blew from the west, promising a later storm of some dimensions, thirty determined paddlers, plus the steersman Hiro and the navigator Teroro, set forth from Bora Bora to test their canoe. It moved sedately across the light green waters of the lagoon and stoutly into the dark waters of the outer ocean, already whipped by the wind into sturdy waves. The canoe moved back and forth in speed tests, then hoisted sail and darted into a long leg down wind. When it had left the lee of the island Teroro asked, “Are we agreed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are,” Mato said, pulling his war club into position.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To Havaiki!” Teroro shouted to the steersman, and West Wind tore into the waves and its paddlers strained as darkness fell over the impartial sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">For generations out of mind Bora Bora had been known among the islands as the land of the muffled paddles, for since it was the smallest of the major islands, its men were required to practice added caution. Now, with the dying moon not yet risen, they paused to wrap their paddle handles in tapa, so that they could creep silently, leaving barely a ripple on the sea, toward the hallowed landing of Oro, where only a few weeks before they had been so deeply humiliated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gently, gently, the double canoe was beached before any outlook spotted it, and thirty resolute men, leaving two to guard the canoe, slipped into the night toward the village where fat Tatai, the intended king of Bora Bora, slept. The avengers had almost reached the village when a dog barked, causing a woman to cry, “Who’s stealing breadfruit?” She sounded an alarm, but before effective action could be taken, Teroro and his men had fallen upon the village and were seeking out all who had insulted them, and most particularly fat Tatai, the nominated king.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Teroro who led the avengers to Tatai’s compound. There he and shark-faced Pa swept into the main hut, smashing and crashing all they encountered. A girl’s voice, soft and petulant, whispered, “He is not here, Teroro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then she screamed in pain, for Pa’s great club struck her, and from the floor she whimpered, “He is not here.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Pa was about to crush her skull when Teroro pulled him away and with his left hand dragged her to safety. From a flare set ablaze by the frugal woman who was determined to protect her breadfruit, Teroro saw that Tehani was naked except for a hastily grabbed skirt which she held before her, and he rediscovered her spectacular beauty. From a distance came his brother’s voice: “Don’t you know any young girl?” and on the impulse of the moment he brought Tehani’s face to his and rasped, “Will you go north with me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you hurt?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“My shoulder.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Broken?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Wait for me at the canoe.” He thrust her toward the shore and then caught her again, muttering, “We have come to kill your father. Do you still want to go?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll wait at the canoe,” she said. Now he heard Mato shout, “We’ve found him!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Save him for me,” Teroro pleaded, swinging his club, but when he reached the prostrate figure of Tatai he saw that Pa had already killed him. Grabbing a handful of thatch from a roof he spread it about the dead man’s head. “The new king of Bora Bora!” he cried derisively.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To the canoe!” the steersman shouted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not before we destroy this place!” Teroro cried, and grabbing from the woman’s hand the brand by which she was inspecting her breadfruit, he swept it along the thatch of a nearby house; the rising wind ripped the flames along, and soon the sacred channel of Oro and the environs of his temple were ablaze. In this light, the men of Bora Bora retreated.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the canoe a battle raged, only prompt reinforcement saved the craft, for one of the guardians was already dead and the other was badly wounded. As the Bora Borans drove back the attackers and leaped into the truncated canoe, Tehani ran from a clump of palms, crying, “Teroro! Teroro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Traitor!” the defeated Havaiki warriors cried, already inventing an explanation that would excuse their defeat. They launched their spears and in their frustration would have killed her, except that Teroro left the canoe, leaped into the surf, and ran back to rescue her.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are in danger!” the steersman warned, standing the canoe out into the channel.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Teroro continued running until he intercepted the girl and swept her into his arms. Then, dodging spears, he dashed for the beach and into the surf. He might not have made the canoe, except that Mato dived into the channel and took the girl, whose shoulder was so damaged that she could not swim. Together they lifted her into the canoe and set their course for Bora Bora, but before they had left the shadow of Havaiki, Teroro said to the girl, “We found your father.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She replied, “I know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The return trip was one of intense excitement, marked by psychological relief at having struck a blow at Havaiki and at the just punishment of a stranger who had presumed to rule Bora Bora. And there was the ironic joy of knowing that before Havaiki could retaliate—if indeed they ever dared try—all involved would be on the open sea, far from Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">But above all, there was great animal joy in realizing that during the strike at Havaiki, the promised storm had actually formed and that it now blew with real force, for although the unexpected strength of the westerly made the journey back to Bora Bora difficult, it also meant that the one essential requirement for a long journey to the north was at hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This storm will blow for days!” Teroro assured his men.</p>

  <p class="normal">At daybreak it became possible to turn and run before the wind safely into the lagoon, and as they reached its protection Teroro drilled his men in the story they must tell: “We took West Wind for a trial. The storm came up. We saw we couldn’t get back. So we laid over in the channel at Havaiki,” He repeated the sequence and added, “In this storm no one from Havaiki would dare come here with the true story.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What about the girl?” Pa asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone looked at Tehani, huddling wet in the hull, and it was immediately apparent, especially to Tehani, that the simplest solution to the difficulty she presented would be to knock her on the head and throw her into the storm. Pa was ready to do this, but Teroro stopped him.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s my girl,” he said bluntly. “We’ll take her to my house.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’ll betray us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She won’t. We’ll say that while we were in the channel I went ashore to get her for the journey north.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you intend taking her?” Mato asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. She’s my girl.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What about your wife Marama?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She can’t bear children. She can’t go.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This one will betray us!” Pa warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro reached down into the hull and pulled Tehani to her feet. Thrusting his face into hers he said, “Until we leave Bora Bora you will speak to no one about this night. No one.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand,” she said, sinking back into the canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is you I will take north,” Teroro promised her.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the canoe neared shore, Mato cried, “What a storm! We went all the way to Havaiki.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Of all the listeners, only Marama knew the full significance of this statement: that some great revenge had been carried out. Swiftly she counted the canoe and saw that the young chief Tami had been lost. “Where is Tami?” she called.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He was lost reefing sail in the storm,” Pa lied.</p>

  <p class="normal">A man called, “Why did you go all the way to Havaiki?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Pa answered, “Teroro went to fetch the girl he will take north with him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the bottom of the hull, where she had lain hidden, Tehani slowly rose, and it was in this way, with the west wind of the storm beating in her face, that Marama learned she would not be accompanying Teroro to the north. No sound escaped her lips. She stood in the wind with both hands pressed against her sides, her hair whipping about her shoulders, her great placid face, handsome as a moon is on the thirteenth night, staring at the stranger in the canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">She thought: “A man is dead. Some dreadful event has occurred that will contaminate the islands for years. Brave stupid men like my husband have gained their revenge, for what it matters. And a young stranger takes my place in the canoe.” Patiently she studied the newcomer and thought: “She is beautiful and her body is well formed. Perhaps she can have children. Perhaps it’s better.” But then she looked at Teroro, and her heart broke.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hiding her tears she turned to go home, but her degradation was not completed, for her husband called, “Marama!” She returned to the canoe and he said, “Take Tehani home,” and Marama reached down and took the girl’s hand and led her home.</p>

  <p class="normal">In its second night the storm rose to an intensity that quite precluded any departure on the day planned, and as the winds howled, those responsible for the voyage had a few last hours free for dreaming. The visions of Teroro were agitated, and toward dawn he saw two women standing by West Wind, and the canoe had no mast on which to hang its sail. He awoke in fright, shook his head vigorously, and realized that the two women were merely Marama and Tehani and their standing by the canoe signified only that each wanted to go north with him, so he wakened Marama, explaining, “The king will allow only one woman to go, Marama, and he insisted that I take a younger.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand,” she said dully.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It isn’t that I’ve grown tired of you,” he whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tupuna explained,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You understand how it is?&#160;&#160; he pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I understand that I have given you no children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You’ve been a good wife, Marama, but the king …”</p>

  <p class="normal">He fell asleep, but before the birds had wakened, he dreamed again and saw his canoe with no mast, and this time the two women spoke, Marama in a deep voice crying, “I am Tane!” and Tehani singing in a lilting voice, “I am Ta’aroa!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro woke trembling and cried, “Why should the gods speak to me on such a night?” And for a long time he tried to decipher the dream, for he knew that before a voyage each dream meant something, but he could not find the key. So he rose in the gray light of dawn, while winds howled and drove rain across the island, and hurried, almost naked, to the hut of old Tupuna.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What did such a dream mean?” he pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Did the voices sound like those of gods?” the bearded old man queried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, they were women’s voices, and yet Tane’s was deep as it should be, and Ta’aroa’s was high and piercing like his voice in a storm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old priest sat gathering his wisdom and listened to the roaring wind that must take them on their way. Finally he announced: “It is very clear, Teroro. Tane and Ta’aroa speak most forcefully when they speak in the wind. You must obey them.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do they want me to do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There was no mast in your dream canoe, and no sail?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“None.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then it’s simple. The gods wish you to take down your single mast and to raise instead two masts, one in each hull.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was such an obvious explanation that Teroro laughed. “I’ve seen canoes like that. One came to Nuku Hiva from the south.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s natural,” Tupuna explained. “When Tane, who rules the land, and Ta’aroa, who rules the sea, speak to a navigator in unison, they must be referring to the element that they rule together, the wind. They want you to erect two sails so that you can catch the wind better.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I will do so,” Teroro said, and forthwith he called his men together, and even though departure could not be far off, he ripped down the mast, found a matching tree, and erected one in the right hull, which he named Tane, and the other in the left, which he called Ta’aroa. Then he lashed each with sennit shrouds, so that by nightfall a man could climb to the top of either and not tear it loose. It would have been unthinkable for a navigator not to obey the gods.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the third night of the storm it was the king’s turn to dream, and he witnessed a fearful sight: two planets in the western sky at sunset, fighting with the sun and pushing it from the sky, whereupon one moved anxiously east and west, while the other roamed north and south. This dream was so ominous that the king summoned his uncle immediately and lay facing him in dead of night, imploring counsel.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Does it mean that we are doomed?” Tamatoa asked in distress.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Which of the wandering stars went searching east and west?” Tupuna inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The great star of evening.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And they were both searching?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Like a dog combing the beach or a woman seeking a lost tapa.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“This is not a good omen,” Tupuna said gravely.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could it mean . . .” the king began, but the concept was too foreboding to be put into words.</p>

  <a id="section_1"></a>

  <p class="normal">“Failure?” Tupuna asked bluntly. “You think it means that our canoe will wander north and south, east and west, until we perish?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Tamatoa answered weakly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It cannot mean that,” Tupuna said consolingly, “for Tane and Ta’aroa themselves spoke to Teroro last night, and he governs the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king was not relieved, for he confided: “My other thought is just as bad.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is it?” the old man asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I wonder if the two stars do not represent Tane and Ta’aroa, and the thing they are looking for is Oro. I wonder if they acknowledge Oro as supreme and do not want to go in our canoe unless he goes along?” He dropped his head and muttered, “Uncle, I am sick with fear that we are doing something wrong.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Tupuna assured him, “I’ve studied every omen. There is no indication of failure. Remember that Tane and Ta’aroa brought us significant advice, the need for two masts. Would they trifle with us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But these searching stars?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll confess, not a good omen. But I am sure that all it means is that in some manner your preparation for the voyage is incomplete. You have forgotten some vital thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall I do?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You must unpack everything and then repack it, and when you have accomplished this, you will know what oversight has displeased the gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And so, on the third day of the storm, King Tamatoa did an un-precedented thing: he threw open his tabu palace to the boat’s crew, and they assembled, on mats which the day before it would have been death to touch, each item that was to go north, and before the king’s careful eye they unwrapped and repacked their treasures.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we our tools?” Tamatoa inquired, and his men brought forth the basalt stones used for cooking, and the sand. They produced bundles of sticks, some hard, some pithy, for making fire. Fishlines of sennit, fishhooks of pearl, nets and spears for sharks, all were in order. There were bluish-green adzes, stone chisels, pounders for crushing taro and others for making cloth. Some chiefs produced digging sticks, harder than many stones and covered with mana from long use in planting taro. There were gourds and calabashes and cups for cooking. Men hauled in bows and arrows, and slingshots with pouches or special stones. There was a long pole with sticky gum for catching birds, a conch shell for calling to prayer, and four heavy stones to serve as sea anchors. The women who had been designated to go, proudly presented fine mats, tight in structure and waterproof, There were bailers to keep the canoe dry, paddles to speed it forward, and extra mats to use as sails. During the passage of a thousand years these wandering island people had, without the assistance of any metal or clay, perfected an intricate civilization and its tools. In one double canoe they were now ready to establish that culture on a distant island. The king was satisfied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we cared for the plants and animals?” he next inquired. Tenderly, the farmers from the group unwrapped the seed-things that would, in time, sustain life in new lands. Taro corms were kept dry and twisted inside pandanus leaves until such time as they could be plunged into soft, wet mud for a new harvest. Banana shoots, on which the voyagers must depend for quick crops, were wrapped in damp leaves and kept cool, while choice coconuts, their eyes un-opened, had to be kept dry lest they launch their shoots. Sugar cane, which all loved, had been cut into joints and was kept alive inside dark bundles made of leaves.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where is the breadfruit?” Tamatoa asked, and four men dragged onto the mat large bundles swathed in leaves and mud. These contained the breadfruit shoots, most delicate of the cargo, whose fruit was so loved by the islanders. When the shoots lay exposed, the king called for his uncle to bless them anew, and the group prayed for their safe transit.</p>

  <p class="normal">Men now hauled two squealing sows into the palace. “Have they been bred?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“To our best boar,” the men replied, hauling into the august presence an ugly, protesting beast, followed by two bred bitch dogs and a male, two chickens and a rooster.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we feed for these animals?” the king inquired, and he was shown bags of dried coconut, mashed sweet potatoes and dried fish. “Place these living things before me, and their food,” Tamatoa commanded, and when the assemblage was completed he cried in terrifying voice, “These are tabu! These are tabu! These are tabu!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In solemn chant the witnesses repeated, “These are tabu!” Then Tupuna blessed them with long prayers of fertility, ending with his own warning: “These are tabu!” It was not just a word that was being used; it was a divine inhibition, and it signified that a man on this trip could see his woman die of starvation, but he could not hand her one morsel of the tabu food, nor eat any himself, for without this seed even those who did reach land would perish.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro now brought in the rations: breadfruit partially dried and rolled into wads for fermentation; pandanus flour made by baking and grating the untasty fruit, just barely palatable but useful on long trips; dried sweet potatoes, shellfish, coconut meat, bonito hard as rock; more than eighty drinking coconuts; three dozen lengths of watertight bamboo filled with clear water. When the food was assembled all could see that it did not bulk large, and Tamatoa studied it with apprehension.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we enough?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Our people have been starving themselves for weeks,” Teroro replied. “We can live on nothing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And have they been drinking little?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Barely a cupful a day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are your fishermen prepared to catch us extra food along the way?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“They have prayed to Ta’aroa. There will be fish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then let us bless this food,” Tamatoa said, and Tupuna recited the long chant which dedicated these rations to the gods. He hoped that the deities would allow his companions to eat the food while searching for a new land, and if it was found, the gods would be rewarded with an endless supply of pigs.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let us check the canoe,” the king said, and he led his subjects into the storm, where they went over each portion of Wait-for-the-West-Wind. The two hulls were not made from single hollowed-out trees, but were built up by butting together three separate sections, each about twenty-five feet long. This meant that the canoe had to be tied together at the joints, and it was here that Bora Bora’s skill with sennit showed itself to greatest advantage, for the huge canoe was as rigid as if carved from a single log, yet it was composed of many pieces, lashed intricately together, and it was these joints that the king now inspected. They leaked, of course, and without constant bailing the canoe would sink, but they did not leak much. The strakes which formed the sides of the two hulls were also lashed on, and were also nearly watertight. The two halves of the canoe were held together, about four feet apart, by eleven stout beams that passed through the inside wall of each hull, and were again bound by powerful sennit, while to them was lashed the long, solid platform upon which the passengers and the gods would ride. This left, in each hull, a narrow space between the edge of the platform and the outer edge of the hull, where the paddlers sat on small movable seats which they shifted back and forth until they found a place amid the cargo where their feet could reach the bottom of the null.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The canoe is fine,” Teroro assured his brother, and the crowd waited in silence while the two brothers and their uncle studied the storm.</p>

  <p class="normal">Finally Tamatoa said, “If the omens are good, we will leave tomorrow at dusk. We must be at sea when the stars rise.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the others had gone, Tamatoa led Tupuna back to the palace and sat disconsolately upon the matting. “What have we overlooked?” he fretted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I saw nothing missing,” the old man said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Have we forgotten some vital thing, Tupuna?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing that is apparent.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What does it mean?” the king cried in deep perplexity. “I have tried so desperately to arrange this correctly. Where have I failed?”</p>

  <p class="normal">His uncle said quietly, “I noticed that as we inspected the goods, when we were through, each man tied his bundles up a little more tightly. At the canoe they fastened the sennit just a bit more strongly. Perhaps that is what the gods wanted us not to forget. The last effort that ensures success.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You think it could have been that?” Tamatoa asked eagerly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s been a long day,” Tupuna evaded. “Let us all dream one more night, and if the omens are good, that must have been the meaning.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So on the fourth night of the storm all men who would make the voyage assembled at the temple according to ancient custom, there to acquire their last flow of mana and to sleep in terror, awaiting the omens that would lay bare the future. Once more Teroro dreamed of his canoe, and again Marama called that she was Tane and again Tehani was Ta’aroa, and just before he wakened, each woman was transformed into a mast, so that the omen was obviously hopeful. Teroro was so pleased that he risked a powerful tabu and crept out of the temple and went to the bed of Marama, lying with her for the last time and assuring her that it was only the king’s command that kept him from taking her, and in the last stormy darkness, she wept. He consoled her by taking from his pouch the length of sennit that he had picked up at the temple in Havaiki, and taking Marama out into the storm, he upturned a large rock and carefully placed the sennit under it. “When I have gone for a year, turn the rock aside and you’ll know whether I survived,” for if the sennit still lay clean and straight, the canoe had reached land; but if it were twisted .. .</p>

  <p class="normal">King Tamatoa woke from his dream and beat his matting with fists of joy, for incredible as it seemed, he had seen the Seven Little Eyes. He had seen them! They had actually hung over Bora Bora and moved off with the canoe. “Oh, blessed Tane!” the king cried in ecstasy. And for the rest of the night he did not sleep, but stood in the doorway of the temple surveying the storm, with the rain in his face, and in those solemn hours he knew an abiding content: “Our boat is well loaded. We have good men. My brother knows the sea and my uncle knows the chants. On this day we shall set forth.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the dream that actually launched the voyage occurred in the hut of old Tupuna, for he saw in dream-spun heavens a rainbow standing directly in the path the canoe must take, and a worse omen than this there could not have been, but as he watched, Tane and Ta’aroa lifted the rainbow and placed it abaft the canoe, where it shone brilliantly on the waters. The omen was so auspicious, evil changing to positive good by the action of gods, that the old man did not even wake to record his dream. In the morning he was suffused with delight and told the king, “Some wonderfully good thing took place last night. I forget what it was, but we will sail tonight.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He went directly to the altar and took down the final precious essentials for the journey: one stone was black and white with flecks of yellow, and round, the size of a fist—it was Tane; the other stone was long and thin and greenish—it was Ta’aroa, god of the oceans on whom they must now depend. Tupuna wrapped each in a small cloth made of yellow feathers, and bearing his deities, he went to the canoe. In a small grass hut erected on the platform just abaft the masts, he placed Tane toward the right mast and Ta’aroa toward the left. The canoe could now be loaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aft of the gods’ house the platform provided an open space which Tupuna would occupy during the entire voyage, tending the deities. Behind him was sleeping space for those members of the crew who were not paddling, and behind them a large grass hut for the twelve women who had been chosen to accompany the crew. Aft of them sat Natabu, silent and sacred, the wife of Tamatoa, accompanied by red-eyed Teura, the wife of Tupuna and seer of the voyage; it was her duty to read omens. At the rear of the house, alone, sat Tamatoa beside a small doorway leading aft, from which he could watch the stars and check the steersman. The captaincy of the canoe lay with Teroro, who stood farthest forward with Tehani at his side; but the actual life and death of this bold adventure rested with the king. Only he could say turn or stay.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the stormy day progressed it seemed inconceivable that any sensible man would venture outside the reef, but all knew that only in such a westerly gale could a canoe go forth with much chance of success, so when the winds kept strong, so did the hearts of the voyagers. They spent the day in prayer and in stowing the canoe. The slaves, the animals and the heavier bundles went into the left-hand hull, whose lead paddler would be Mato, upon whom the beat and rhythm would depend. Into the right-hand went the food, the trees and the extra mats. This would be headed by Pa. At the rear of this hull, cornerwise from Mate, the steersman Hiro would stand.</p>

  <p class="normal">The afternoon wore on and the crew said good-bye to wives they could not take, and to their children. Teroro went for the last time to see grave Marama in the little house where they had been so happy. She was dressed in her finest tapa, yards and yards of it about her handsome body, and her hair was marked with flowers.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Guide the canoe well, Teroro,” she said softly. “I shall pray for you.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will always be in my heart,” he promised.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” she corrected. “When you are gone you must forget me. It would not be fair to Tehani.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are my wisdom, Marama,” he said sorrowfully. “When I see things clearly it is always because you showed me the way. I need you so much.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Be quiet, Teroro,” she said, and as they sat on the matting for the last time she tried to share with him all the things she had forgotten to tell him. “Never go against the counsel of Mato. He sometimes seems stupid because he comes from the north side of the island, but trust him. If you get into a fight, rely on Pa. I like Pa. The man you prefer is Hiro. He’s fun, but can you trust him in an emergency? Listen to your uncle Tupuna. His teeth are yellow with wisdom. And, Teroro, never again go on a journey of simple vengeance.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Would you have had us depart in shame?” he countered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well,” she admitted, “one can never defeat Havaiki enough.” She caught her breath and confided, “It would have been unbearable to have a Havaiki man for king.” Then she added quickly, “But mere revenge, especially when the king does not give consent. That must be past.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For the last time she talked with her man, and as the time came when he was forced to go she thought: “There is so much more he needs to know.” When he took his first step toward the door she fell on the matting and kissed his ankles, and heard him say haltingly, “Marama, when we sail, please don’t come on shore. I could not bear it,” at which she rose full height and cried sharply, “Me! Stay hidden indoors when my canoe is leaving? It is my canoe. I am the spirit of the sails and the strength of the paddlers. I will take you to land, Teroro, for I am the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And when the men climbed aboard Wait-for-the-West-Wind, Marama, with her beautiful hair in the storm, guided them with her spirit and blessed them, and said to young Tehani, “Take care of out husband. Fill him with love.” But at the last minute she was thrust aside by a most unexpected arrival. It was the High Priest, come down to the launching with a long retinue of assistants, and he went to the canoe and cried, “Great Oro bids you safe journey!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Grabbing hold of the bowsprit, he stepped aboard, clutching the mast Tane as he did so. Kneeling before the gods’ house, he pushed aside the grass door and deposited inside a sanctified statue of Oro made of sacred sennit woven with his own hands and clothed in feathers. In haunting voice he cried into the storm, “Great Oro, bless this canoe!” And as he stepped ashore, Teroro saw that a smile of enormous relief had come upon the face of his new wife, Tehani. She had been willing to go upon the seas with strange gods, but now that Oro was with her, she knew the journey would succeed.</p>

  <p class="normal">And so the double canoe, Wait-for-the-West-Wind, loaded and creaking with king and slave, with contradictory gods and pigs, with hope and fear, set forth upon the unknown. At the prow stood Teroro, ill-named the wise one, but at this fateful moment he was wise enough not to look back at Bora Bora, for that would have been not only an evil omen, but folly as well, for he would have seen Marama, and that sight he could not have borne.</p>

  <p class="normal">When West Wind reached the reef, and stood for a moment in its last stretch of easily navigable water, all in the canoe experienced a moment of awful dread, for outside the coral barrier roared the storm on slashing waves and tremendous deeps. Just for an instant Mato, lead paddle on the left, whispered, “Great Tane! Such waves!” But with prodigious force he led the paddlers into a swift rhythm that bore them directly into the heart of the storm. The canoe rose high in the sea, teetered a moment with its shrouds whistling, then ripped down, down into the valley of the waves. Spray dashed across all heads and the two halves seemed as if they must tear apart. Pigs squealed in terror and dogs barked, while in the flooded grass house women thought: “This is death.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But instantly the powerful canoe cut into the waves, found itself, and rode high onto the crest of the ocean, away from Bora Bora of the muffled paddles, away from the comforting lagoon and onto the highway that led to nothingness.</p>

  <p class="normal">IN <span>SUCH WEATHER</span> King Tamatoa led his people into exile. They did not go in triumph or with banners flying; they fled at night, with no drums beating. They did not leave with riches and in panoply; they were rudely elbowed off their island with only enough food to sustain them precariously. Had they been more clever, they would have held their homeland; but they were not and they were forced to go. Had they perceived the deeper nature of gods, they would never have fallen prey to a savage deity who tormented them; but they were stubborn rather than wise, and the false god expelled them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Later ages would depict these men as all-wise and heroic, great venturers seeking bright new lands; but such myths would be in error, for no man leaves where he is and seeks a distant place unless he is in some respect a failure; but having failed in one location and having been ejected, it is possible that in the next he will be a little wiser.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was, however, one overriding characteristic that marked these defeated people as they swept into the storm: they did have courage. Only if they had been craven could they have swallowed their humiliation and remained on Bora Bora; this they would not do. It is true that they fled into the dusk, but each man carried as his most prized possession his own personal god of courage. For Teroro it was the mighty albatross that winged its way over distant seas. For King Tamatoa it was the wind that spoke to him in tempests. For Tupuna it was the spirit of the lagoon that brought fish. And for his ancient bleary-eyed wife, Teura, the keeper of omens, it was a god so powerful that she scarcely dared mention its name. But it followed her in the ocean, her great and sweet and powerful deity, her courage in the unknown.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they had reached, more swiftly than ever before, a point off the north coast of Havaiki, Teroro crawled over to where Mato paddled and said, “I am going to speak with the king about our feeling. Promise me that you will support me.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I promise,” Mato said.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even if it means death?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Even then.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Precariously, Teroro made his way aft to consult with his brother, laying bare a wish that startled the king: “I cannot sail with Oro in this canoe. Let us throw him into the ocean.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A god!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot sail with him.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa summoned old Tupuna, who struggled aft with difficulty and sat with the brothers. “Teroro wants to throw Oro into the ocean,” Tamatoa explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">The thought was even more repulsive to the old man than it had been to the king, and he warned in powerful voice that such a thing had never been done. But Teroro was adamant: “We have suffered enough from Oro. My men cannot sail this canoe with such a burden.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“If we were on land . . .” Tupuna protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” the king said firmly. “It is impossible.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But Teroro would not surrender. He shouted forward for Mato, who soon appeared. Tamatoa was grave and said, “Teroro wants to throw the god Oro into the ocean.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It must not be done!” Tupuna warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Let Mato speak!” Teroro demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teroro is right,” the stocky warrior said. “We have known only terror from this red god, deep, humiliating terror.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But he is a god!” Tupuna protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must not carry such poison to a new land,” Mato insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tupuna warned: “If you do such a thing, the winds will tear this canoe apart. The ocean will open to its depth and swallow us. Seaweed will grow in our hair.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I would rather be dead,” Mato shouted back, “than to install Oro in a new land.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point Teroro faced Tupuna and cried, “You say Oro will punish us? I say this to Oro.” And he flung his head back, howling into the wind, “Oro, by your sacred pig, by your length of banana shoot, by the bodies of all men sacrificed to you, I condemn you and declare you nothing. I curse you and revile you and cast excrement in your face. Now strike me down. If you control the storm, raise your bloodstained hands and strike me down.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood motionless as the others listened in horror, waiting. When nothing happened he fell to his knees and whispered, just loud enough for the others to hear, “But, gentle Tane, if you guide this canoe, and powerful Ta’aroa, if you control this storm, forgive me for what I have just said. Forgive me especially for what I am about to do. But I cannot go forward with Oro as a passenger in this canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He rose like a man in a dream, bowed low to his brother, and made dutiful obeisance to the priest. “Forgive me,” he said in a choking voice. “If in the next moment we are swept to death, forgive me.” He stumbled forward in the storm, but when he reached the gods’ house itself he was powerless to open the rain-sodden door. Inherited fear of gods, plus what he remembered of his early training when it was hoped he would become a priest, rendered him incapable of action and he returned to the rear. “I cannot act without your approval, brother,” he confessed. “You are my king.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa cried, “We shall be lost if we destroy a god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro fell on the platform and clutched his brother’s feet. “Command me to destroy this evil thing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t do it, Tamatoa!” his uncle warned. In this moment of indecision, when the ultimate values of the canoe were laid open on the stormy deck, it was tough Mato who acted.</p>

  <p class="normal">He shouted, “King Tamatoa, if we take Oro with us, when you land you kill more people to show him gratitude, just in case it was he who brought us there. And once started, we will kill more, and more. You, Tupuna, you love gods, but we must save you from the temptation of growing to love this one!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And he rushed to the gods’ house, uncovered the sennit-and-feather form of the avenging god and raised it high into the storm. “Go back to Havaiki where you came from!” he shouted. “We don’t want you. You’ve eaten our men. You’ve driven us from the home of our ancestors. Go away!” And with a vast sweep of his arm, Mato threw the god far out to sea.</p>

  <p class="normal">But winds caught at the feathers and for an awful moment held the god aloft, so that it kept pace with the canoe. “Auwe!” shrieked the priest. “Auwe! See, Oro follows us!”&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p class="normal">King Tamatoa, perceiving this miracle, fell to the platform in prayer, but Teroro, awakened from his indecision, grabbed a spear and with fury launched it at the god. It missed, but the shaft brushed the feathers and deflected the deity into the turbulent deep. Calmly, he turned to the prostrate king and said, “I have killed the god. You may do with me as you wish.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Go to your post,” the king mumbled, stricken with fear. As Teroro moved forward upon the canoe whose burden of terror he had helped diminish, he felt his craft sweep into the storm with new vigor; the stays sang a sweeter song; and he could see from their smiles that his men were assured. But when he passed the gods’ house and recalled how powerless he had been at the vital moment, he looked across to where Mato sat, stubbornly paddling to keep the canoe right with the storm, and he wanted to clasp the man in brotherhood, but only Mate’s shoulders were free, and no man would dare touch another’s shoulders, for they were reserved for the personal god to perch on when he inspired a man with courage; so Teroro merely whispered into the storm, “You were the brave one, Mato,” and the sturdy paddler replied, “The canoe feels lighter.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Teroro recovered his post he found Tehani, the daughter of Oro, weeping. He knelt beside her and said, “You must try to forgive me, Tehani. I killed your father and now I have killed your god.” He took her by the hands and swore: “I will never offend you again.” The dazzling girl, storm upon her face, looked up. She was bereft of the very foundations of her being, and although she tried to speak she could say nothing; but from then on Teroro treated her with extra kindness.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this moment, when the captains of the canoe were most agitated, that Tane and Ta’aroa conspired to present them with an omen that erased from all hearts memories of what had just happened. The rain came heavily for about fifteen minutes, followed by strong winds that blew clouds scudding ahead in darkness until the clouds parted and the fine stars of heaven were momentarily</p>

  <p class="normal">revealed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then it was that the wisdom of Tupuna in setting forth at dusk on the new day of the month became apparent, for there, rising in the eastern sky and with no bright moon in competition, sparkled the Seven Little Eyes. It was their first twilight appearance of the year, their reassuring return which proved that the world would continue for at least twelve more months. With what extraordinary joy the voyagers greeted the Little Eyes. From the grass house women came forth and filled their hearts with comfort. Those crew members who had to keep the canoe headed with the wind found new resilience in their tired muscles, and Teroro knew that he was on course.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, the miracle vouchsafed, Tane drew the clouds once more across the heavens and the storm continued, but contentment beyond measure settled upon the canoe, for it was at last apparent that the company moved in accordance with divine laws. How sweet the roar of the wind that bore them on, how consoling the motion of the waves that carried them into the unknown; how appropriate the world, how well ordered and secure the heavens. On the canoe, that daring and insignificant bundle of wood lashed together by sennit and men’s wills, all hearts were deep in peace, and the onwardness of their journey sang contentedly in all parts of the craft, so that when old Tupuna crawled back to his watching point abaft the gods’ house, he called softly to Teroro ahead, “The king is content. The omen proves that Oro was caught by Ta’aroa and conveyed safely to Havaiki. All is well.” And the canoe moved on.</p>

  <p class="normal">The most critical part of any twenty-four-hour period came in the half hour just before dawn, for unless the navigator could catch a glimpse of some known star and thus check course he would have to proceed through an entire day with only the unreliable sun to steer by; for while it was true that master astronomers like Teroro and Tupuna could follow each movement of the sun and take from it their heading, they could not use it to determine their latitude. For that they depended upon the stars; their sailing directions reminded them which stars culminated over which islands, and to pass the last moments of night without seeing any constellations was not only an omen of bad luck in the future, it was also proof of present difficulty, which, if it persisted for several days, might develop into catastrophe.</p>

  <p class="normal">For example, after their first fleeting glimpse of the Seven Little Eyes, Teroro and his uncle had waited anxiously for Three-in-a-Row, which other astronomers then living in distant deserts had already named Orion’s Belt, for the sailing directions said that these stars hung over Nuku Hiva, their replenishment point. But Three-in-a-Row had not appeared during the night watch and Teroro had been unable to determine his latitude. Now the conspicuous stars were setting without having been seen, and the navigator was worried.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had, however, observed on earlier trips that it was a peculiarity of his ocean that in the last few minutes of morning twilight, some star, as if determined to aid mariners, pushed clouds aside and showed itself, and he thought there was still time for this to happen.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Three-in-a-Row will appear there,” Tupuna announced confidently, but Teroro wondered if the night’s strong wind might not have blown the canoe rather farther north than his uncle suspected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Maybe they will be closer to that cloud,” Teroro suggested. The difference of opinion was not to be resolved, for clouds continued to streak out of the west to meet the sun rising on the other side of the ocean. On this day dawn was neither inspiring nor refreshing, for the sun straggled reluctantly up behind many layers of cloud, half illuminated the ocean with dull gray and proved to the voyagers that they did not know where they were.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro and Tupuna, having accomplished all they could, fell into immediate sleep in the stormy daylight; and it was then that the fetter’s wife, wizened, red-eyed old Teura, paid for her passage. She climbed out of the grass house, splattered sea water over her wrinkled face, rubbed her bleary eyes, threw her head back and started studying the omens. In nearly two thirds of a century of living with the gods, she had unraveled many of their tricky ways. Now she watched now Ta’aroa moved the waves, how the spume rose, how the tips fell away and in what manner they tumbled back into the troughs. She marked the color of the sea and the construction of the basic swells that underlay the more conspicuous waves.</p>

  <p class="normal">At midmorning she saw a land bird, possibly from Bora Bora itself, winging its way out to sea, and from its flight she was able to determine the bird’s estimate of how long the storm would continue, and it confirmed her own. A bit of bark, washed out to sea days before from Havaiki, was of particular interest to the old woman, for it proved that the ocean had a northerly set, which was not apparent from the wind, which blew more toward the northeast.</p>

  <p class="normal">But most of all the rheumy-eyed old seer studied the sun, for although it was well masked behind layers of cloud, her practiced eye could mark its motion. “Star men like Tupuna and Teroro don’t think much of the sun,” she snorted, but when she placed her observations of its course beside the deductions she had made from earlier omens she concluded: “Those men don’t know where they are! We’re far to the north of our course!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But what Teura particularly appreciated were those unexpected messages from the gods which meant so much to the knowing. For example, an albatross, not large and of no possible importance as food, happened to fly past the canoe and she saw with gratification that he kept to the left, or Ta’aroa’s side, and since the albatross was known to be a creature of that god’s, this was a refreshing omen; but when the bird insisted upon returning to the canoe, also from the left side, and finally perched on the mast of Ta’aroa, the coincidence could no longer be termed an omen. It was a definite message that the god of the oceans had personally sent to an old woman who had long honored him, and Teura looked at the sea with new love, and sang:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>“O, Ta’aroa, god of the boundless deep,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Ta’aroa of the mighty waves</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>And the troughs that lead down to blackness,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>We place our canoe in your hands,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>In your hands we place our lives.”</em></p>

  <p class="normal">Contentedly, the old woman gathered her many omens, and they were all good. The men of her canoe might be lost, and the stars remain hidden, and the storm continue, but Ta’aroa was with them and all was well.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the late afternoon, Tupuna and Teroro, before resuming their duties, came aft to find out from Teura where they were, and she advised them that they rode much farther north than even Teroro had suspected.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the men reasoned. “We’ve been to Nuku Hiva. Directions don’t call for a turn yet.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Head for the pit from which Three-in-a-Row climbs,” she warned with stubborn finality, “or you’ll miss Nuku Hiva.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You wait till the stars come out,” Teroro challenged. “You’ll see we’re on course.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teura would not argue. For her any problem was simple: either the gods spoke or they didn’t, and if they did, it was useless to explain to someone else how the message was delivered. “We are far to the north,” she snapped. “Turn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But how can we know?&#160;&#160; Teroro pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The gods said so,” she muttered and went to bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">When she was gone, the two men reviewed her various omens, but the only one upon which they were willing to place much reliance was the albatross. “You can’t have a much better omen than an albatross,” Tupuna reasoned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If Ta’aroa is with us,” Teroro concluded, “we must be on the right course.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From the grass house old Teura stuck out her head and snapped, “I’ve noticed that Ta’aroa stays with a canoe only as long as its men keep it on course. Turn.”</p>

  <p class="normal">That night it could not be proved that Teura was either right or wrong, for no stars appeared, neither in the darkness of midnight nor in the anxious dawn, and Teroro steered solely by running directly before the wind, with only a small section of sail out, trusting that the storm was steady and not blowing in circles.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the third starless night, when the canoe could have been in real danger, Teroro reached a major decision. While consulting with Tupuna he said, “We’ve got to believe that the storm is blowing true.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Arrival of the albatross is best proof of that,” Tupuna pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then I think we’d better take full advantage of it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You intend hoisting the sails to the peak?</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. If it is the gods who are sending us, we ought to go forward as fast as we can.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When they presented their proposal to King Tamatoa, he showed his disturbance over the lack of stars and pointed out that the night crew’s estimate of position did not jibe with that of the old woman, but he also appreciated the good sense of his brother’s proposal. “I am much impressed by that albatross,” Tamatoa reasoned. Teura confided one fact to me that she didn’t tell you. When the bird came hack the second time to land on the mast of Ta’aroa, it landed with its left foot extended.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The astronomers whistled, for this was a most propitious omen, since it confirmed the leftness of the bird’s intentions and its peculiar inclination toward the mast of Ta’aroa. “I can only conclude,” the king reasoned, “that Ta’aroa, for some reason of his own, has sent us this unusual storm. I agree with Teroro. Hoist the sails.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Teroro sent Mato and Pa up the masts, and in complete darkness, while the canoe was already speeding forward into deep swells, the two young chiefs lashed fast the sturdy matting sails and with shouts of accomplishment slid down and began to play out the sails until they trapped the wind and whipped the canoe forward. Through the rest of the night and into the third disappointing dawn the canoe raced ahead on a course no man knew, for King Tamatoa realized that there came a time on any voyage when a man and his canoe had to trust the gods and to run forward, satisfied that the sails had been well set and the course adhered to whenever possible; but when all precautions failed to disclose known marks, it was obligatory to ride the storm.</p>

  <p class="normal">At daylight, gnawed by uncertainty, the men went to sleep and old Teura came forth to gather omens. A white-bellied petrel wheeled in the sky but said nothing. Fishermen forward caught bonito, which helped conserve food but told nothing about position, and several fine squalls deposited calabashes full of sweet water trapped by the sails.</p>

  <p class="normal">At noon when Teura advised the king that things were going well, he shrewdly asked, “Any omens of position?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“None,” she replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“How is the ocean running?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No signs of land, no islands ahead, the storm will blow for five more days.” In such brief report she summed up two thousand years of study by her ancestors, and had she been required to explain why she knew that there was no land ahead, she would have been unable to do so. But there was none, and of this she was absolutely certain.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Has the albatross returned?” the king asked anxiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No omens,” she repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was now seven days since the storm had risen on the night of Bora Bora’s revenge against Havaiki, and three complete days that the canoe had been at sea, but true to Teura’s prediction and to the amazement of all, the gale continued, and when the evening watch took over, Teura and the king wondered if the sails should not be lowered, for there were not going to be any stars that night, either. But in the consultation Teroro said, “I am convinced we are going forward,” and since there was no one with superior knowledge to contradict him, Tamatoa asked, “You are willing to keep the sails aloft tonight?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must,” Teroro said. And through that starless night and into the starless dawn, he ran with the storm, insisting upon this because of his canoe’s name. More than a century ago a wise man had named the predecessor of the predecessor of this canoe Wait-for-the-West-Wind because he had found that when Bora Borans went forth driven by the western hurricane, they went well. And until the stars had a chance to prove the contrary, Teroro was willing to abide by this ancient wisdom.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was somewhat shaken however on the fifth night when Tupuna crept up to the prow and whispered, “I have never known a storm from the west to blow so long. We are entering the ninth night. It surely must have veered.”</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long pause in the darkness and Teroro looked down at the slim body of his wife, curled against the mast. He wondered what she would say to this problem, but she was not like Marama; she had no ideas. So he wrestled with the alternatives alone and felt irritated when Tupuna pressed him: “Can you recall a constant wind of such duration?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Teroro snapped, and the two men parted.</p>

  <p class="normal">But toward dawn of the fifth day, when it seemed probable that no stars would show, Tupuna became frightened: “We must drop the sails. We don’t know where we are.</p>

  <p class="normal">He insisted upon a conference with the king and Teura, which produced three voices against Teroro, for it was obvious that the canoe was lost and that to persevere blindly without some confirmation from the stars would be folly. But Teroro could not accept this reasoning.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Of course we’re lost,” he confessed. “But Ta’aroa sent his bird to us in the storm, didn’t he?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” they had to agree.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This isn’t an ordinary storm,” he argued. “This is an unheard-of gale sent to the canoe of Bora Bora. From the oldest days, what has been the name of our canoe?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we are lost!” the king reasoned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We were lost from the moment we set forth,” Teroro cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” Tamatoa cried, refusing to be enticed by his brother’s rhetoric. “We were headed for Nuku Hiva. For fresh water and new supplies.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And to listen once more to the sailing chants,” Tupuna added cautiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We must lie to,” the king announced firmly. “Then, when we catch a glimpse of Three-in-a-Row, we will know where Nuku Hiva is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was under this pressure that Teroro broached his bold plan. He spoke quietly and without gestures, saying, “I am not lost, brother, because I am riding with the desires of Ta’aroa. I am heading with a great storm, and I am content to ride that storm.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know how to get to Nuku Hiva?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro looked at each of his companions and replied, “If we are concerned only with Nuku Hiva, I am lost. If we are going to Nuku Hiva only to get additional food and water, I am lost. But in all sense, brother, do we need to go to Nuku Hiva?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited for these strong words to sink into the hearts of his seafaring companions, and he saw that he had used words they understood. Before anyone could speak he added, “What is there for us in Nuku Hiva? To get water we have to fight with those who live there, and some of us will be killed. Do we need water? To get food we must take great risks, and if we are captured, we are cooked alive and eaten. Do we need food? Hasn’t Ta’aroa sent us fresh fish in abundance? Have we not disciplined ourselves as men have never done before so that each eats only a shred each day? Brother Tamatoa, if the storm is with us, what extra things do we need?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa resisted his brother’s eloquence and asked, “Then you are lost. You can’t take us to Nuku Hiva?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I cannot take you to Nuku Hiva, but I can take you to the north.”</p>

  <p class="normal">As if in support of his bold plan, a sudden force of wind ripped across the waves and spilled into the sails, whipping the canoe along in a burst of speed. Spray leaped, and dawn, still blotting out the stars and all certain knowledge, came upon the men of Bora Bora.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are alone on the sea,” Teroro said solemnly. “We are engaged in a special voyage, and if it takes us past Nuku Hiva, then I say good, for we are doubtless being sped by the gods on some great mission. Brother, I beg you, let us keep the sails aloft.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king would not present this dangerous request to the opinion of the group, for he knew that the old people, Tupuna and Teura, would insist upon caution, and he suspected that perhaps now was a time when caution was not required. Weighing all possibilities, he sided with his brother and said, “We should get some sleep.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So for two more nights, the sixth and seventh of the voyage, the canoe sped on, safe in the mighty arms of Ta’aroa, and in those somber, critical days, all eyes were kept on the left mast, for it was obvious that not the man Teroro but the god Ta’aroa was in command of this canoe. And then, on the late afternoon of the seventh day, red-eyed Teura spotted an omen. On the left side of the canoe came five dolphins, a propitious number in itself, followed by an albatross of some size. The creatures of Ta’aroa had come to celebrate the deliverance of this canoe from the storm, but before Teura could alert her companions to this fine intelligence, an event of transcendent importance occurred. A shark appeared not far from the canoe and followed it lazily for a moment, trying to catch Teura’s attention, and when she saw it her heart cried with joy, for this great blue beast of the sea had long been her personal god; and now, while the others were blind with their work, it swam along the left side of the canoe, its blue head above the waves.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you lost, Teura?” it inquired softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes, Mano,” she replied, “we are lost.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you searching for Nuku Hiva?” the shark asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. I have said that it was . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will not see Nuku Hiva,” the great blue shark advised. “It is far to the south.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What shall we do, Mano?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tonight there will be stars, Teura,” the shark whispered. “All the stars that you require.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In perfect contentment the old woman closed her tired red eyes. “I have waited for you for many days,” she said softly. “But I did not feel completely lost, Mano, for I knew you must be watching us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve been following,” the shark said. “Your men were brave, Teura, to keep the sails aloft like that.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teura opened her eyes and smiled at the shark. “I am ashamed to tell you that I argued against it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We all make mistakes,” the blue beast said, “but you are on the right course. You’ll see when the stars come out.” And with this consoling assurance, he turned away from the canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There’s a shark out there!” a sailor cried. “Is that a good omen, Teura?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tamatoa,” the old woman said quietly, “tonight there will be stars.” And as she spoke two land birds with brown-tipped wings flew purposefully toward the south and Tamatoa saw them and asked, “Does that mean that our land is far to the south?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We shall never see it, Tamatoa, for we are safe on a new heading.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you sure?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You will see when the stars come out.”</p>

  <p class="normal">With what excited apprehension Tupuna and Teroro waited for the dusk. They knew that when the Seven Little Eyes peeked above the eastern horizon, the canoe’s course would be apparent; and when Three-in-a-Row appeared, they could deduce where Nuku Hiva lay. With what apprehension they waited.</p>

  <p class="normal">Exactly as Teura had predicted, toward dusk the clouds disappeared and the evening sun came out. As it sank, a tremendous exhilaration filled the canoe, for trailing the sun was the bright star of evening, visible even in twilight and soon accompanied by a second wandering star of great brilliance, and like the two gods on whom the canoe depended, the stars marched grandly toward the rim of the ocean and vanished in their appointed pits of heaven.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the platform old Tupuna called all passengers to silence as he threw back his white head and intoned a prayer: “Oh, Tane, in our preoccupation with the storm of your brother Ta’aroa we have not thought of you as often as we should. Forgive us, benevolent Tane, for we have been fighting to stay alive. Now that the heavens are restored to remind us of your all-seeing kindness, we implore you to look with favor upon us. Great Tane, light the heavens that we may see. Great Tane, show us the way.” And all prayed to Tane and felt his benevolence descend upon them from the nearer heavens.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, as darkness deepened over the still heaving ocean, and as the winds died momentarily from the gallant outstretched sails, the stars began to appear; first the mighty golden stars of the south, those warm familiar beacons that showed the way to Tahiti, followed by the cold blue stars of the north, scintillating in their accustomed places and competing with the quarter moon. As each star took its position, its friends in the canoe greeted it with cries of recognition, and an assurance that had been absent for many days returned.</p>

  <p class="normal">The critical stars had not yet risen, so that in spite of their joy, men could not suppress the questions that often assailed voyagers: “What if we have sailed away from heavens we knew? What if the Little Eyes do not rise here?” Then slowly and uncertainly, for they were not brilliant stars, the sacred group arose, precisely where it should have been, climbing up out of its appropriate pit.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The Little Eyes are still with us!” Tupuna shouted, and the king raised his head to offer a prayer to the guardians of the world, the core around which the heavens were built.</p>

  <p class="normal">The astronomers then met to read the signs, and they concluded that the storm had blown fairly steadily from the west, but apparently there had been, as Teura had guessed, a definite drift of the sea northward, for the Little Eyes were going to culminate much higher in the heavens than would be proper were the canoe on course to Nuku Hiva; but to say specifically how serious the drift had been, the navigators would have to wait until Three-in-a-Row appeared, which would not be for another two hours.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the three plotters waited, and when Three-in-a-Row was well up into the heavens it became self-evident that the canoe was far, far north of the course to Nuku Hiva and was thus committed to an unknown ocean with no opportunity to replenish stores. It was therefore a solemn group that went aft to report to the king: “The storm has carried us even more swiftly than Teroro imagined.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king’s face showed his distress. “Are we lost?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Uncle Tupuna replied, “We are far from Nuku Hiva and will see no land we know.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we are lost?” the king pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No, nephew, we are not,” Tupuna said carefully. “It is true that we have been carried into far regions, but they are not off our course. We seek lands which lie beneath the Seven Little Eyes, and we are nearer to them tonight than we had a right to expect. If we do not eat too much . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Even though Tamatoa had given permission to keep the sails aloft, and even though he had known that the canoe thus ran the risk of missing Nuku Hiva, he had nevertheless hoped that they would stumble upon that known island, and perhaps find it congenial, and possibly establish homes there. Now he was committed to the greater journey, and he was fearful.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could still alter course and find Nuku Hiva,” he suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro remained silent and allowed old Tupuna to carry the argument: “No, we are well on our way.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But to where?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tupuna repeated the only chant he had ever memorized for sailing to the north. In effect it said: “Keep the canoe headed with the storm until the winds cease completely. Then turn into the dead sea where bones rot with heat and no wind blows. Paddle to the new star, and when winds strike from the east, ride with them westward until land beneath the Seven Little Eyes is found.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king, himself an adequate astronomer, pointed due north and asked, “Then the lands we seek are there?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Tupuna agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we go this way?” and he pointed eastward, where the winds of the dying storm were driving them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The course seemed so improbable, to head for a promised land by fleeing it, that the king cried, “Can we be sure that this is the way?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the old man confessed, “we cannot be sure.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Because the only knowledge we have says that this is the way to do it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king, ever mindful of the fact that fifty-seven people were in his care, grasped Tupuna by the shoulders and asked bluntly, “What do you honestly think about the land that is supposed to be under the Little Eyes?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old man replied, “I think that many canoes have left these waters, some blown by storms, others like us in exile, and no man has ever returned. Whether these canoes reached land or not, we do not know. But some man, with a vision of what might be, composed that chant.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then we are sailing with a dream for our guide?” Tamatoa asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the priest answered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Gloom was not allowed to capture the canoe, for the reappearance of the stars had excited the paddlers and the women, so that even while the astronomers were consulting, shark-faced Pa had handed his paddle to another and had grabbed a length of tapa which he had wrapped around his shoulders, masking his head. Now imitating a very fat man, he pranced up and down the platform, shouting, “Who am I?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“He’s the headless king of Bora Bora!” Mato cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look at fat Tatai coming to be our king, with his head knocked off!”</p>

  <p class="normal">In wild burlesque, Pa ridiculed the coronation of the headless would-be king. Paddlers stopped and began to beat rhythms on the canoe, and a woman produced a little drum with a high, almost metallic sound, and the night’s revelry was launched.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is this new dance?” Tamatoa inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ve never seen it before,” Tupuna replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know what he’s doing?” the king asked Teroro.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” the younger man said hesitantly. “Pa is … Well, Tamatoa, some of us heard that fat Tatai was to be king after we left . . . and . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa looked at the headless dancer and asked, “So you sneaked over to Havaiki . . . some of you . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And now Tatai has no head.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well . . . yes. You see, we felt …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You could have ruined the entire voyage, couldn’t you?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We could have, but we figured that Tatai’s village wouldn’t come over to Bora Bora very soon . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Why not?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Well, when we left there wasn’t any village.”</p>

  <p class="normal">In the light of the quarter moon King Tamatoa looked at his daring young brother, and there was much that he would have said, but the sound of ancient drumming stifled his logical thoughts, and with a stirring leap he whirled forward to where Pa was dancing and entered into the ritual dance of the kings of Bora Bora. Like a boy, he gestured and postured and told forgotten stories, until toward the end he grabbed Pa’s tapa and threw it over his head and did the now popular dance of the headless king from Havaiki. When the drums had reached a crescendo he threw off the tapa, stood very straight in the night wind, and exulted: “We did not go like cowardsl I, the king, was afraid to strike at those evil worms, those faces of excrement, those vile and awful dead fish of the stinking lagoon. I was afraid to endanger the coming voyage. But Pa here was not afraid. And Mato was not afraid. And my brother …” In gratitude Tamatoa looked aft to where Teroro stood in darkness. The king did not finish his sentence. With demonic energy he leaped into a dance of victory, shouting, “I dance in honor of brave men! Let’s have the celebration you were denied!” And he ordered extra rations of food to be broken out, and more drums, and all the water anyone wanted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Like children careless of the dawn, they reveled through the night, got drunk on laughter, and feasted on food that should have been conserved. It was a wild, wonderful night of victory, and each half hour someone shouted, “Pa! Do the dance of the headless king!” Then, one by one, in savage triumph, they rose and screamed classic island insults at the vanquished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Havaiki is the strong scent of spoiled meat!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The worthless trash of Havaiki take pleasure in their shame.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Fat Tatai trembles in fear. The hair on his head trembles. He crawls away and hides like a hen in a secret place.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“The warriors of Havaiki are the froth of water, boys playing with mud balls.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro, succumbing to the excitement, shouted, “Fat Tatai is a sneaking little dog, excrement of excrement.” But as his voice shrieked in the wind, he happened to look forward to where beautiful Tehani huddled against the masts, weeping as her father was reviled. Then he also saw Mato, from the left hull, touch the girl’s hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mato said, “This is the way of victory. You must forgive us.” From the rear new voices rose with foul invective, and the drums beat on.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the rainy dawn, of course, King Tamatoa took gloomy stock of what the celebration had cost and for a moment he thought: “We are children. We discover we’re lost and half an hour later we eat enough food for a week.” Contritely, he issued stringent orders that what had been wasted must be made up by austere rationing. “Even though we have plenty of water,” he warned, “each must drink only a cupful a day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So, with the remnants of the tempest at their back and with victory in their hearts, the voyagers sailed eastward for the ninth night, and the tenth, and the fifteenth. Their swift canoe, fleetest large craft that ever up to then had plied the oceans of the world, averaged two hundred miles a day, better than eight miles an hour, day after day. They sailed more than halfway to the lands where Aztecs were building mighty temples, and well onto the approaches of the northern land where Cheyennes and Apaches built nothing. In the direction they were then headed they could encounter no land until they struck the continent itself; but before that happened they would have perished of thirst and starvation in the doldrums. Nevertheless, they carried on, according to Teroro’s plan. There was fear each dawn when the sun rose; there was momentary joy each night when the stars reappeared to tell their progress; for day was the enemy, crowded with uncertainty and the hourly acknowledgment of their forlorn position; but night was consolation and the spiritual assurance of known stars, and the waxing of the fat moon through its many stages, and the soft cries of birds at dusk. How tremendous an experience this was, at the end of a long day which had provided only the unstable sun, to watch the return of night and to discover, there in the west where the sun went down, the evening star and its wandering companion, and out of the vastness to see the Little Eyes come peeping with their message: “You are coming closer to the land we guard.” How marvelous, how marvelous the night!</p>

  <p class="normal">AS <span>THE CANOE REACHED EASTWARD</span> and the storm abated, the daily routine became more settled. Each dawn the six slaves stopped bailing and cleaned out the canoe, while farmers moved among the animals and fed them, giving the pigs and dogs fish caught in the early hours, plus some mashed sweet potatoes and fresh water trapped in the sails. The chickens got dried coconut and a fish to pick at, but if they lagged in eating, a slim, dark object darted out from among the freight and grabbed the food away, unseen by the slaves, for as on all such trips, some rats had stowed aboard, and if the voyage turned out badly, they would be the last to die … would indeed sustain themselves for many drifting days on those who had already perished.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the women in the grass hut had wakened, the female slaves would move inside, throw out the slops and do the other necessary chores. Particularly, they kept clean that corner of the hut which had been cut off by lengths of tapa and reserved for those women who were experiencing their monthly sickness, for it was a tabu entailing death for there to be any communication between men and women at such time.</p>

  <p class="normal">In general, however, the tabus which were rigidly enforced on land had to be suspended aboard a crowded canoe. For example, had any of the rowers while ashore come as near the king as all now were, or had they stepped upon his shadow, or even the shadow of his cape, they would have been killed instantly, but in the canoe the tabu was suspended, and sometimes when the king moved, men actually touched him. They recoiled as if doomed, but he ignored the insult.</p>

  <p class="normal">The tabus which centered upon eating were also held in abeyance, for there was no one aboard of sufficient status to prepare the king’s food as custom required; nor had the keeper of the king’s toilet pot come on the journey, so that a slave, terrified at the task, had to throw into the sea the kingly bowel movements, rather than follow the required custom of burying them secretly in a sacred grove, lest enemies find them and with evil spells conjure the king to death.</p>

  <p class="normal">Women upon such a trip did not fare well. Obviously, the food had to be reserved for men who did the hard work of paddling. The pigs and dogs also had to be kept alive to stock the new land, which left little for the women. That was why, at every opportunity, they set fishing lines and tended them carefully. The first fish they caught went to the king and Teroro, the next to Tupuna and his old wife, the next four to the paddlers, the seventh and eighth to the pigs, the ninth to the dogs, the tenth to the chickens and the rats. If there were more, the women could eat.</p>

  <p class="normal">With great niggardliness, the prepared foods were doled out, a piece at a time, but when they were distributed, how good they tasted. A man would get his stick of hard and sour breadfruit, and as he chewed on it he would recall the wasteful feasts he had once held, when abundant breadfruit, fresh and sweet, had been thrown to animals. But the food that gave most pleasure, the master food of the islands, came when the king directed that one of the bamboo lengths of dried poi be opened, and then the rich purplish starch would be handed out, and as it grew sticky in the mouth, men would smile with pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">But soon the poi was finished and the bundles of dried breadfruit diminished. Even the abundant rain ceased and King Tamatoa had to reduce his rations still further, until the crew were getting only two mouthfuls of solid food, two small portions of water. Women and slaves got half as much, so that unless the fishermen could land bonito, or trap water in the sails, all existed at the starvation level.</p>

  <p class="normal">Early in the dry period the king and Teroro made one discovery, a tormenting and frustrating one made by all similar voyagers: when the tongue was parched and the body scorched with heat, when one’s whole being craved only water, an unexpected squall often passed a mile to the left or right, dumping untold quantities of water upon the sea, just out of reach, but it was no use paddling furiously to overtake the squall, for by the time the canoe reached the spot where the rain had been falling, the squall had moved on, leaving all hands hotter and thirstier than before. Not even an expert navigator like Teroro could anticipate the vagaries of a rain squall and intercept it; all one could do was to plod patiently on, his lips burning with desire and his eyes aflame, trying to ignore the cascades of water that were being dumped out of reach; but one could also pray that if one did continue purposefully, in a seamanlike manner, sooner or later some squall would have to strike the canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">On a voyage such as this, sexual contact was expressly tabu, but this did not keep the king from gazing often at his stately wife Natabu; and old Tupuna saw to it that Teura got some of his food; and in the heat of day Tehani would dip a length of tapa into the sea, cool it, and press it over her husband’s sleeping form. At night, when the stars were known and the course set, the navigator would often sit quietly beside the vivacious girl he had brought with him and talk with her of Havaiki, or of his youth on Bora Bora, and although she rarely had anything sensible to say in reply, the two did grow to respect and treasure each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the most curious thoughts between men and women involved the twelve unassigned women and the thirty-four unattached men. Perhaps the word unassigned is not completely accurate to describe the women, because some of them in Bora Bora had been specific wives of individual men, but on such an expedition it was understood that upon landing, any such woman would accept as her additional husbands two or three of the men who had no wives, and no one considered this strange. So on the long voyage men with no women began cautiously to do two things: to form close friendships with men who had women, establishing a congenial group of three or four who would later share one woman as their common wife; or to study the unmarried women in an effort to decide which one could most satisfactorily be shared with one’s group; so that before the voyage had consumed even fifteen days, groups had begun to crystallize, and without anything definite having been said, it was remarkably well understood that this woman and these three men would build a house for themselves and raise common children, or that that husband and wife would accept those two friends of the man into complete and intimate harmony, thus populating the new land. It was further understood that each woman, until she reached the age when children no longer came, would be kept continuously pregnant. The same, of course, was true of the sows and the bitches, for the major task of all was to populate an empty, new land.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the eleventh night occurred an event which, in its emotional impact upon a people who lived by the stars, had no equal on this voyage. Even the abandonment of Oro had failed to generate the excitement caused by this phenomenon.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the West Wind crept constantly northward it became obvious to the astronomers on board that they must lose, and forever, many old familiar stars which lay below what astronomers would later call the Southern Cross. It was with sorrow, and even occasionally with tears, that Tupuna would follow some particular star which as a boy he had loved, and watch it vanish into the perpetual pit of the sky from which stars no more rise. Whole constellations were washed into the sea, never to be seen again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Although this was cause for regret, it did not occasion alarm, for the men of Bora Bora were exceptional astronomers. They had developed, from careful observation, a year of 365 days, and they had found that from time to time an extra day was required to keep the seasons aligned. Their ritual life was organized around a moon-month of twenty-nine and a half days, which is the easy way to build a calendar; but their year of twelve months was founded on the sun, which is the right way. They could predict with accuracy the new appearance and subsequent motion or the wandering stars, while the merest glimpse of the moon told them in what phase it stood, for each night of the moon-month bore its own special name, derived from the progress of the moon through its cycle. Men like Tupuna and Teroro even knew, by counting ahead six months, in what constellation the sun stood; so they were prepared, as they sailed north, to lose some of their familiar stars; conversely, they knew that they would come upon new stars, and it was wrth the joy of discovery that they identified the hitherto unseen stars of the north. But in all their wisdom, they were not prepared for what they discovered on the eleventh night.</p>

  <p class="normal">Having set their course, they were surveying the northern heavens when the old man saw, bobbing above the waves, a new star, not of maximum brightness like the vast beacons of the south—for the voyagers found the northern stars rather disappointing in brilliance in comparison with theirs—but nevertheless an interesting newcomer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“See how it lies in a direct line from the two stars in Bird-with-a-Long-Neck,” Tupuna pointed out, referring to stars which others called the Big Dipper.</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Teroro could not catch the bright star, for it danced up and down on the horizon, now visible above the waves, now lost Then he saw it, a bright, clean, cold star, well marked in an empty space of the sky. Speaking as a navigator he said, “That would be a strong star to steer by … when it rises a little higher.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tupuna observed, “We must watch carefully, the next few nights, to see which pit of heaven it goes into.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So on the twelfth night the two men studied the new guidepost, but as dawn appeared each was afraid to tell the other what he had seen, for each realized that he had stumbled upon an omen of such magnitude that it did not bear speaking of. Each keeping his own counsel, the two astronomers spent the last minutes of darkness watching the new star with an apprehension that bordered upon panic, and when daylight ended their vigil, they licked their dry lips and went to their beds knowing they would not sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was no more than midaftemoon on the following day when the two men took their positions to study the heavens. “Stars won’t be out for many hours,” Tupuna said warily.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’m watching the sun,” Teroro lied, and when Tehani brought him his water and stood smiling by the mast of Tane, her preoccupied husband did not bother to smile back, so she went aft with the women.</p>

  <p class="normal">Swiftly, at six in the evening, and not lingeringly as at Bora Bora, the sun left the sky and the stars began to appear. There were the Seven Little Eyes, blessing the canoe, and later Three-in-a-Row, now well to the south, and the very bright stars of Tahiti; but what the men watched was only the strange new star. There it was, and for nine hours the two astronomers studied it, unwilling to come to the conclusion that was inescapable. But when they had triangulated the sky in every known way, when they had proved their frightening thesis beyond doubt, they were forced, each working by himself, to the terrifying conclusion.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Tupuna who put it into words: “The new star does not move.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is fixed,” Teroro agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two men used these words in a new meaning; they had always spoken of the bright wandering stars that moved in and out of the constellations like beautiful girls at a dance; and they had contrasted these with the stars of fixed position; but they realized that in a grand sense the latter also moved, rising out of pits in the east and falling into the pits of the west. Some, who hurried around the Southern Cross, rose from one pit and quickly dropped into another, and there were even a few that never disappeared below the waves; but all moved through the heavens. The new star did not.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We had better consult with the king,” Tupuna advised, but when they went aft they found Tamatoa sleeping, and no man would dare waken another suddenly, lest the sleeper’s spirit be out wandering and have no time to slip back in through the corner of the eye. A man without a spirit would go mad, but Tamatoa slept soundly and his uncle grew nervous, holding as he did the news of the ominous fixed star.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could you cough?” he asked Teroro. The navigator did, but with no results.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What would let him know we are waiting?” Tupuna asked petulantly. He went outside the grass house, took a paddle and lapped the side of the canoe, whereupon the king, like any captain who hears a strange noise aboard his ship, rolled uneasily, cleared his throat and gave his wandering spirit ample time to climb back into his eye.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What’s happening?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“An omen of terrible significance,” Tupuna whispered. They showed Tamatoa the new star and said, “It does not move.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Anxiously, the three watched for an hour and then summoned old Teura, advising her: “Tane has set a star in the heavens which does not move. What can it signify?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old woman insisted upon an hour in which to study the phenomenon for herself, at the end of which she decided that the men were correct. The star did not move, but how should such an omen be read? She said, haltingly, “Tane is the keeper of the stars. If he has placed this miracle before us, it is because he wishes to speak to us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What is his message?” the king asked apprehensively.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I have never seen such an omen,” Teura parried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could it mean that Tane has put a barrier, fixed and immovable, before us?” Tamatoa asked, for it was his responsibility to keep the voyage harmonious with the will of the gods. Others could afford to misinterpret omens, but not he.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It would seem so,” Teura said. “Else why would the star be set there, like a rock?”</p>

  <p class="normal">Apprehension gripped them, for if Tane was against this voyage, all must perish. They could not go back now. “And yet,” Tupuna recalled, the chant says that when the west wind dies, we are to paddle across the sea of no wind toward the new star. Is this not the new star, fixed there for us to use?”</p>

  <p class="normal">For many minutes the group discussed this hopeful concept and concluded that it might have merit. They decided, therefore, that this should be done: continue for the coming day along the course set by the westerly wind and consult again at dusk, weighing all omens. The four went to their appointed places and discharged their various tasks, but in the remaining moments of the night Teroro stood alone in the prow studying the new star, and gradually a new idea germinated in his brain, tentatively at first, like a drum beating in the far distance, and then with compelling intensity.</p>

  <p class="normal">He began softly: “If this new star is fixed . . . Suppose it actually does hang there night after night and at all hours . . . Let’s say that every star in the new heavens can be associated with it in known patterns . . .” He lost the thread of some compelling thought and started over again.</p>

  <p class="normal">“If this star is immovable, it must hang at a known distance above the horizon . . . No, that’s not right. What I mean is, for every island, this fixed star must hang at a known distance . . . Start with Tahiti. We know exactly what stars hang directly over Tahiti at each hour of the night for each night of the year. Now if this fixed star . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Again he was unable to draw together the threads of his thought, but he sensed that some grand design of the gods was making itself manifest, so he wrapped one arm around the mast of Tane and concentrated his entire being upon the new star. “If it hangs there forever, then every island must stand in some relationship to it. Therefore, once you see how high that star is, you know exactly how far north or south you must sail in order to find your island. If you can see the star, you will know! You will know!”</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly, and with dazzling clarity, Teroro saw an entirely new system of navigation based on Tane’s gift, the fixed star, and he thought: “Life must be sweet indeed for sailors in these waters!” For he knew that northern sailors had what southerners did not: a star which could tell them, at a single glance, their latitude. “The heavens are fixed!” he cried to himself. “And I shall be free to move beneath them.” He looked happily to the west where the Little Eyes blinked at him prior to dawn, and he whispered to them, “The new land you lead us to must be sweet indeed if it exists in such an ordered ocean beneath such an ordered sky.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And for the rest of the voyage, through the terrible days that lay ahead, Teroro alone, of all the canoe, knew no fear. He was sure. He was secure in his conviction that Tane would not have hung that fixed star where it was except for some high purpose, and he, Teroro, had divined that purpose. Up to now he had given no one cause to think that he merited his name, the Brain; certainly he could never be a knowledgeable priest like his uncle Tupuna, and that was a pity, for priests were needed. Nor had he wisdom in political counsels like his brother; but on this night he proved that he could do something that none of his companions could: he could look at the evidence planted in the universe and from it derive a new concept, and a greater thing than this no mind can accomplish. On what Teroro foresaw that night the navigation of the islands ahead would be built and their location in the ocean determined. In his joy of discovery Teroro wanted to sing, but he was not a poet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet in his very moment of triumph, he experienced an emptiness that had been with him for many days and which apparently was not going to dissipate. When he finally grasped the significance of the fixed star, he wanted to discuss his concept with Marama, but she was absent and there was not much use talking about a thing like this with Tehani, for whereas Marama would have grasped the idea at once, beautiful little Tehani would have looked at the heavens and asked, “What star?” It was curious the way in which Manama’s last cry persisted in Teroro’s ears: “I am the canoe!” In a most strange way, she was, for she was the on-going spirit of the canoe; it was her grave face that Teroro often saw ahead of him on the waves, and when Wait-for-the-West-Wind in its swift flight overtook the vision in the waters, Marama smiled as the canoe swept past, and Teroro felt that all was well.</p>

  <p class="normal">Into the arid heat of the doldrums they plunged. The sun beat upon them by day and the rainless stars mocked them at night. Now not even distant squalls passed with the tantalizing hope that rain might come. They knew it would not.</p>

  <p class="normal">Teroro planned so that Mato and Pa, the two sturdiest paddlers, would not work at the same time; also, after an hour’s stint in the right hull, which tore the muscles of the left shoulder, the paddlers would shift sides and wear out their right shoulders. At each shift six men would drop out and rest. But onward the canoe went, constantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">From time to time the stronger women would take paddles, whereupon the shift was shortened to half an hour; while in the bottom of each hull the artisans and the slaves worked constantly bailing the water that seeped in through the calked cracks where the pieces of log which formed the hull had been tied together.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was ironic, and a fact remarked by all, that in the storm when fresh water was plentiful, the sails did most of the work, whereas now, when men sweated and strained endlessly with the paddles, there was no water. The king ordered it to be doled out in ever-decreasing portions, so that the harder the men worked, the less they had to drink.</p>

  <p class="normal">The women, with scarcely any water, suffered miserably, while the slaves were near death. The farmers had an especially cruel task. Tenderly they would hold open the mouth of a pig and drop water inside to keep the animal alive, whereas they needed the fluid more than the animal; but the death of a fanner could be tolerated; the death of a pig would have been catastrophe.</p>

  <p class="normal">Still the canoe bore on. At night Teroro, with his lips burning, would place on the platform near the prow a half coconut, filled with placid sea water, and in it he would catch the reflection of the fixed star, and by keeping this reflection constant in the cup, he maintained his course.</p>

  <p class="normal">At daybreak, red-eyed Teura would sit in the blazing heat, her old body almost desiccated by the sun, and speculate upon the omens. Hour after hour she muttered, “What will bring rain?” The flight of birds might indicate where islands were, and water, but no birds flew. “Red clouds in patches in the eastern sky bring rain, for certain,” she recalled, but there were no clouds. At night the moon was full, brilliant as a disk of polished Tridacna, but when she studied the moon she found no ring around it, no omen of storm. “If there were a wind,” she muttered, “it might bring us to a storm,” but there was no wind. Repeatedly she chanted: “Stand up, stand up, the big wave from Tahiti. Blow down, blow down, the great wind from Moorea.” But in these new seas her invocations were powerless.</p>

  <p class="normal">Day followed day of remorseless heat, worse than anyone in the canoe had ever previously experienced. On the seventeenth day one of the women died, and as her body was plunged into the perpetual care of Ta’aroa, god of the mysterious deep, the men who were to have been her husbands wept, and through the entire canoe there was a longing for rain and the cool valleys of Bora Bora, and it was not surprising that many began to deplore having come upon this voyage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hot nights were followed by blazing days, and the only thing that seemed to live in the canoe was the dancing new star as it leaped about in the coconut cup which Teroro studied; and then late one night as the navigator watched his star, he saw on the horizon, lighted by the moon, a breath of storm. It was small at first, and wavering, and Mato whispered, “Is that rain?”</p>

  <p class="normal">At first Teroro would not reply, and then, with a mighty shout, he roared into the night, “Rain!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The grass house emptied. The sleeping paddlers wakened and watched as a cloud obscured the moon. A wind rose, and a light capping of the sea could be seen in starlight. It must be a substantial storm, and not a passing squall. It was worth pursuing, and everyone began to paddle furiously. Those with no paddles used their hands, and even the king, distraught with hope, grabbed a bailing bucket from a slave and paddled with it.</p>

  <p class="normal">How desperately they worked, and how tantalizingly the storm eluded them. Through the remaining portion of the night, the canoe sped on, its men collapsing with thirst and exhaustion, in pursuit of the storm. They did not catch it, and as the blazing day came upon them, driving the clouds back to the horizon, and then beyond, an awful misery settled upon the canoe. The paddlers, their strength exhausted in the fruitless quest, lay listless and allowed the sun to beat upon them. Teroro was of no use. Old Tupuna was near death, and the pigs wept protestingly in the waterless heat.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only the king was active. Sitting cross-legged on his mat he prayed ceaselessly. “Great Tane, you have always been generous to us in the past,” he cajoled. “You have given us taro and breadfruit in abundance. You brought our pigs to fatness and birds to our traps. I am grateful to you, Tane. I am loyal to you. I prefer you above all other gods.” He continued in this way for many minutes, hot sweat upon his face, reminding the deity of their close and profitable relationships in the past. Then, from the depth of his despair, he pleaded: “Tane, bring us rain.”</p>

  <p class="normal">From a short distance forward, red-eyed Teura heard the king praying and crept back to him, but she brought him terror, not assurance, for she whispered, “The fault is mine, nephew.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What have you done?” the king asked in spittle-dry tones.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Two nights before we left Bora Bora I had a dream and I ignored it. A voice came to me crying, ‘Teura, you have forgotten me.’”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” the king rasped, catching his aunt’s withered arm. “That was my dream.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“A voice crying, ‘You have forgotten me!’ Was that your dream, too?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” the king replied in ashen tones. “Two stars, combing the heavens, looking for something I had forgotten to put into the canoe.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Was that why you unpacked everything at the last?” Teura asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And you discovered no lack?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Nothing.” The two wise people, on whom the success of this voyage now depended, sat despondent. “What have we forgotten?” They could find no answer, but they knew, each now fortified with substantiation from the other, that this voyage was conducted under an evil omen. “What have we forgotten?” they pleaded.</p>

  <p class="normal">In bleak despair they stared at each other and found no answer, so Teura, her eyes already inflamed from watching the merciless sun, went out to the lifeless platform and prayed for omens, and as she gave her whole being to this duty, the great blue shark came beside the canoe and whispered, “Are you afraid that you will die, Teura?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Not for myself,” she replied calmly. “I’m an old woman. But my two nephews . . . Isn’t there anything you can do for them, Mano?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You haven’t been watching the horizon,” the shark admonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“To the left.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And as she looked, she saw a cloud, and then a disturbance ruffling the ashen sea, and then the movement of a storm, and rain. “Oh, Mano,” she whispered, afraid to believe. “Is the rain coming toward us?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look, Teura,” the great blue shark laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Once before it looked the same,” she whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“This time follow me,” the blue beast cried, and with a shimmering leap he splashed into the sea, her personal god, her salvation.</p>

  <p class="normal">With a wild scream she cried, “Rain! Rain!” And all rushed out from the house, and dead sleepers wakened to find a storm bearing down upon them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Rain!” they mumbled as it marched across the ocean nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It’s coming!” Tamatoa shouted. “Our prayers are answered.” But old Teura, laughing madly as the benign water struck her face, saw in the heart of the storm her own god, Mano, his blue fin cutting the waves.</p>

  <p class="normal">Almost as if by command, the near-dying voyagers began to throw off their clothes, their tapa and their shells, until each stood naked in the divine storm, drinking it into their eyes and their blistering armpits and their parched mouths. The winds rose, and the rains increased, but the naked men and women of Bora Bora continued their revel in the slashing waves. The sails came down and the mast of Ta’aroa was almost carried away, and the dogs whined, but the men in the canoe swept the water into their mouths and embraced each other. Into the night the storm continued, and it seemed as if the sections of the canoe must break apart, but no one called for the storm to abate. They fought it and drank it and washed their aching bodies with it, and sailed into the heart of it, and toward morning, exhausted in sheer joy, they watched as the clouds parted and they saw that they were almost under the path of the Seven Little Eyes, and they knew that they must ride with the easterly wind that had brought the storm. Their destination lay somewhere to the west.</p>

  <p class="normal">IT <span>WAS</span> A <span>LONG</span> leg to windward they took. For nearly two thousand miles they ran before the easterlies, covering most days more than a hundred and fifty miles. Now the fixed star remained at about the same height above the horizon, on their right, and they followed close to the path of Little Eyes. At sunset Teroro would tilt his coconut cup backward to catch the bright star that stood near Little Eyes as they rose in the east. Later, as the constellation which men in the deserts had named the Eagle sank into the west, he would steer by its bright star, shifting back and forth between it ahead and Little Eyes to the rear, thus keeping always on course.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was on this long westward leg that King Tamatoa’s earlier insistence on discipline preserved the voyage, for now food had run perilously low and for some perverse reason the numerous fish in these strange waters would not bite; Tupuna explained that it was because they lived under the influence of the fixed star and that the Bora Bora fishhooks had not been adjusted to this new consideration. Every woman and all men who were not paddling kept lines, long and short, in the sea, but to no avail.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a little coconut left and a small amount of breadfruit, but no taro. Even the pigs, absolutely essential to the success of the journey, were famishing. But in this extremity the thirty pddlers, who worked constantly, survived amazingly. Their stomachs had long since contracted into hard little fists, shrunk to nothing under tight belly muscles. Their strong shoulders, devoid of even a trace of fat after nearly a month’s steady work, seemed able to generate energy from nothing. With neither food nor adequate water, the men sweated little; through sun-reddened eyes they constantly scanned the horizon for omens.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was old Teura, however, who saw the first substantial sign; on the twenty-seventh morning she saw a small piece of driftwood, torn away from some distant tree, and Teroro avidly directed the canoe toward it. When it was pulled aboard it was found to contain four land worms, which were fed to the astonished chickens.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It has been in the ocean less than ten days,” Teura announced. Since the canoe could travel five or six times faster than a drifting branch, it seemed likely that land lay somewhere near; and old Teura entered into a period of intense concentration, clutching at omens and interpreting them hopefully by means of old prayers.</p>

  <p class="normal">But West Wind was not to be saved by incantations. It was Mato, a trained sailor, who late one afternoon saw in the distance a flock of birds flying with determination on a set course westward. “There’s land ahead. They’re heading for it,” he cried. Tupuna and Teroro agreed, and when, a few hours later, the stars rose, it was reassuring to see that the Seven Little Eyes confirmed that they were near the end of their journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">“A few more days,” Teroro announced hopefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">And two days later, aching with hunger, Mato again spotted a bird, and this one was of special significance, for it was a gannet, poised seventy feet in the air; suddenly it raised its wings, dropped its head toward the waves, and plunged like a thrown rock deep into the ocean. It looked as if it must have split its skull on impact, but by some mysterious trick, it had not, and in a moment it flew aloft with a fish in its beak. Deftly it flipped the food into its gullet, then plunged again with head-splitting force.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are surely approaching land!” Mato cried. But many on the platform thought of the gannet not as a harbinger of land, but rather as a lucky bird that knew how to fish.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the early morning of the twenty-ninth day a group of eleven long black birds with handsome cleft tails flew by on a foraging trip from their home island, which lay somewhere beyond the horizon, and Teroro noted with keen pleasure that their heading, reversed, was his, and while he watched he saw these intent birds come upon a group of diving gannets, and when those skilled fishers rose into the air with their catch, the fork-tailed birds swept down upon them, attacked them, and forced them to drop the fish, whereupon the foragers caught the morsels in mid-air and flew away. From their presence it could be deduced that land was not more than sixty miles distant, a fact which was confirmed when Teura and Tupuna, working together, detected in the waves of the sea a peculiar pattern which indicated that in the near distance the profound westerly set of the ocean was impounding upon a reef, which shot back echo waves that cut across the normal motion of the sea; but unfortunately a heavy bank of cloud obscured the western horizon, reaching even to the sea, and none could detect exactly where the island lay.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Don’t worry!” Teura reassured everyone. “When the clouds do lift, watch their undersides carefully. At sunset you’ll see them turn green over the island. Reflections from the lagoon.” And so convinced was Teura that they were approaching some small island like Bora Bora with a lagoon, that she chose the spot from which the wave echoes seemed to be generating and stared fixedly at it.</p>

  <p class="normal">As she had hoped, toward dusk the clouds began to dissipate, and it was Teura who first saw the new island looming ahead. Gasping, she cried, “Oh, great Tane! What is it?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Look! Look!” shouted Teroro.</p>

  <p class="normal">And there before them, rearing from the sea like an undreamed-of monster, rose a tremendous mountain more massive than they had ever imagined, crowned in strange white and soaring majestically into the evening sunset.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What a land we have found!” Teroro whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is the land of Tane!” King Tamatoa announced in a hushed whisper. “It reaches to heaven itself.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And all in the canoe, seeing this clean and wonderful mountain, fell silent and did it reverence, until Pa cried, “Look! It is smoking!” And as night fell, the last sight the men of Bora Bora had was of a gigantic mountain, hung in the heavens, sending fumes from its peak.</p>

  <p class="normal">The vision haunted the voyagers, for they knew it must be an omen of some proportions, and in the quiet hours of the night old Teura dreamed and woke screaming. The king hurried to her side, and she whispered, “I know what it was we forgot.”</p>

  <p class="normal">She went aft with her nephew, to where no one could hear, and she confided: “The same dream returned. I heard this voice crying, “You have forgotten me.’ But this time I recognized the voice. We have left behind a goddess whom we should have brought.”</p>

  <p class="normal">King Tamatoa felt a sick quaking near his heart and asked, “What goddess?” for he knew that if a goddess felt insulted, there was no restriction on the steps she might take in exacting revenge; her capacity was limitless.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is the voice of Pere, the ancient goddess of Bora Bora,” the old woman replied. “Tell me, nephew, when your wandering stars were searching the heavens, were they not attended by specks of fire?”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king tried to recall his haunting premonitory dream and was able, with extraordinary clarity, to conjure it, and he agreed: “There were specks of fire. Among the northern stars.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They summoned Tupuna and told him the burden of his wife’s dream, and he acknowledged that it must have been the goddess Pere who had wanted to come on the voyage, whereupon his nephew asked, “But who is Pere?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“In ancient days on Bora Bora,” the old man explained as the thin-horned curve of the dying moon rose in the east, “our island had mountains that smoked, and Pere was the goddess of flame who directed our lives. But the flame died away and we supposed that Pere had left us, and we no longer worshiped the red-colored rock that stood in the temple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I had forgotten Pere,” Teura confessed. “Otherwise I would have recognized her voice. But tonight, seeing the smoking mountain, I remembered.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“And she is angry with us?” the king asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes,” Teura replied. “But Tane and Ta’aroa are with us, and they will protect us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old seers went back to their places, and the king was left alone, in the shadow of his new land now barely visible in the misty moonlight. He was disturbed that a man could take so much care to satisfy the gods, and that he could nevertheless fail. He could study the omens, bend his will to them, and live only at the gods’ commands; but always some small thing intruded; an old woman fails to recognize the voice of a goddess and disaster impinges upon an entire venture. He knew the rock of Pere; it had been retained in the temple for no known reason, both its name and its properties forgotten; it was no longer even dressed in feathers. It would have been so simple to have brought that rock, but the facts had eluded him and now he felt at the mercy of a revengeful goddess who had been deeply insulted, the more so because she had taken the trouble to warn him. He beat his hands against the poles of the grass hut and cried, “Why can we never do anything right?”</p>

  <p class="normal">If the king was perplexed by his arrival at the new land, there were other passengers who were terrified. In the rear of the left hull, the slaves huddled in darkness, whispering. The four men were telling the two women that they had loved them and that they hoped the women were pregnant and that they would bear children, even though those children would be slaves. They recalled the few good days they had known on Bora Bora, the memorable days when they had chanced upon one of the king’s stray pigs and had eaten it surreptitiously, for to have done so openly would have meant immediate death, or the days when the high nobles were absent from the island and they had been free to breathe. In the fading darkness of the night, for a day of great terror was about to dawn, they whispered of love, of human affection and of lost hopes; for the four men knew that when the canoe landed, a temple would be built, and when the four corner post holes had been dug, deep and sound, one of them would be buried alive in each, so that his spirit would forever hold the temple securely aloft, and the doomed men could already feel the taste of earth in their nostrils; they could feel the pressure of the sacred post upon their vitals; and they knew death.</p>

  <p class="normal">Their two women, soon to be abandoned, could taste worse punishment, for they had come to love these four men; they knew how gentle they were, how kind to children and how alert to the world’s beauty. Soon, for no ascertainable reason, the men would be sacrificed, and then the women would live on the edge of their community, and if they were already pregnant, and if their children were sons, they would be thrown under the prows of canoes to bless the wood and to be torn in shreds by it. Then when they were not pregnant, on strange nights men of the crew, their faces masked, would rudely force their way into the slave compartments, lie with the women, and go away, for if it were known that a chief had had contact with a slave woman, he would be punished; but all had such contact. And when the children of these unions were born, they would be slaves; and if they grew to manhood, they would be ripped to pieces under canoes or hung about the altars of gods; and if they grew to comely womanhood, they would be ravished at night by men they never knew. And the cycle would go on through all eternity, for they were slaves.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the early light of morning it became apparent that the smoking mountain and its supporting island lay much farther away than had at first been supposed, and a final day of hunger and work faced the paddlers; but the visible presence of their goal spurred the famished men so that by nightfall it was certain that next morning the long voyage would end. Through the last soft tropical night, with the luminous mountain ahead, the crew of the West Wind followed their rhythmic, steady beat.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they approached the end of a trek nearly five thousand miles long, it is appropriate to compare what they had accomplished with what voyagers in other parts of the world were doing. In the Mediterranean, descendants of once-proud Phoenicians, who even in their moments of glory had rarely ventured out of sight of land, now coasted along established shores and occasionally, with what was counted bravery, actually cut across the trivial sea in voyages covering perhaps two hundred miles. In Portugal men were beginning to accumulate substantial bodies of information about the ocean, but to probe it they were not yet ready, and it would be six hundred more years before even near-at-hand islands like Madeira and the Azores would be found. Ships had coasted the shores of Africa, but it was known that crossing the equator and thus losing sight of the North Star meant boiling death, or falling off the edge of the world, or both.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the other side of the earth, Chinese junks had coasted Asia and in the southern oceans had moved from one visible island to the next, terming the act heroism. From Arabia and India, merchants had undertaken considerable voyages, but never very far from established coasts, while in the undiscovered continents to the west of Europe, no men left the land.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only in the north of Europe did the Vikings display enterprise even remotely comparable to that of the men of Bora Bora; but even they had not yet begun their long voyages, though they had at their disposal metals, large ships, woven sails, books and maps.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was left to the men of the Pacific, men like cautious Tamatoa and energetic Teroro, to meet an ocean on its own terms and to conquer it. Lacking both metals and maps, sailing with only the stars and a few lengths of sennit, some dried taro and positive faith in their gods, these men accomplished miracles. It would be another seven centuries before an Italian navigator, sailing under the flag of Spain and fortified by all the appurtenances of an advanced community, would dare, in three large and commodious ships well nailed together, to set forth upon a voyage not quite so far and only half as dangerous.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn Teroro brought his canoe close to land at the southeastern shore of the vast volcanic island that rose from the southeast end of the rupture in the ocean floor. When the shoreline became visible, the voyagers had many thoughts. Teroro reflected in some disappointment: “It’s all rocks. Where are the coconuts? Where’s the water?” Mate, who paddled in the hull nearest the land, thought: “No breadfruit.” But King Tamatoa mused: “It is the land Tane brought us to. It must be good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Only Tupuna appreciated the profound problems which the next few hours would bring. In trembling apprehension he thought: “The children of my brothers are about to step upon new land. Everything depends on the next minutes, for this island is obviously filled with strange gods, and we must do nothing to offend them. But will I be able to placate them all?”</p>

  <p class="normal">So he moved with agitation about the canoe, endeavoring to arrange things so that the unknown gods would be offended as little as possible. “Don’t pick up a single stone,” he warned. “Don’t break a branch or eat a shellfish.” Then he went to the gods’ house and called Pa to his side, handing him a square of flat stone. “You will follow me,” he said, “because you are extremely brave.” He adjusted the king’s feather cape, handed Teroro a spear, and lifted into his own shaking hands the two gods, Tane and Ta’aroa.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Now!” he cried, and the canoe touched land.</p>

  <p class="normal">First to disembark was Tamatoa, and as soon as he had made one footprint in the sand, he stopped, kneeled down, and took that earth into his hands, bringing it to his lips, where he kissed it many times. “This is the land,” he chanted gravely. “This is a man’s home. This is good land to settle upon, a good land on which to have children. Here we shall bring our ancestors. Here we bring our gods.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Behind him, in the prow of the canoe, stood Tupuna, his face upraised. “Tane, we thank you for the safe voyage,” he whispered. Then, in penetrating voice, he called, “You unknown gods! You brave and gentle gods who hold this island! You fine and generous gods of the smoking mountain! You forty gods, you forty thousand gods, you forty million godsl Allow us to land. Allow us to share your treasures, and we will honor you.” He was about to step ashore with his own gods, but the idea of invading a new land was too overpowering, so he shouted once more, “Terrible, all-seeing gods, may I please land?”</p>

  <p class="normal">He stepped upon the land, expecting some awful omen, but none came and he told Pa, “You may bring the rock of Bora Bora onto its new home,” and the shark-faced warrior leaped ashore with the only lasting memorial of home: a square of rock. When he stood beside the King, Tupuna cried, “Now you, Teroro, with your spear.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when it came time for Teroro to leave the canoe, he did not worry about new gods. He placed his two hands on the prow of Wait-for-the-West-Wind and whispered, as gently as if he were speaking to Marama, “Beautiful, lovely ship. Forgive me for cutting away your glory. You are the queen of the ocean.” And he leaped ashore to guard his brother in the next fateful moments.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tupuna left three warriors at the canoe to guard it, while the others strung out in line and formed the solemn procession that would invade the island. At the head of his nervous column marched Tupuna, and whenever he came to a large rock, he begged the god of that rock to let him pass. When he came to a grove of trees he cried, “God of these trees, we come in friendship.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They had gone only a short distance inland when a passing cloud dropped misty rain upon them, and Tupuna shouted, “We are received! The gods bless us. Quick! See where the rainbow ends!”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Pa, holding the stone of Bora Bora, who saw the arc come to earth, and Tupuna cried, “There will be our temple!” And he hurried to the spot, crying, “Any evil that is here, Tane, push it aside, for this is to be your temple!”</p>

  <p class="normal">The foot of the rainbow had fallen on an inviting plateau overlooking the ocean, and Tamatoa said, “This is a good omen indeed.” Then he and his white-bearded uncle began their search for a high male rock, for both knew that the earth itself was female, and therefore polluted, but that solid rocks of impermeable stone were male, and therefore uncontaminated, and after a long search he found a large protrusion of male rock coming erect out of fine reddish soil, and when Tupuna saw it he said, “A perfect site for an altar.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So Pa placed upon this male rock his slab of Bora Bora stone, and with this symbolic action the new island was occupied, for upon the flat stone Tupuna reverently placed the fine old gods Tane and Ta’aroa. Then he climbed back to the sea with a coconut cup which he filled with water, and this he sprinkled over the temple area, over the gods, and over every human being who had come in the canoe, flicking it into their faces with the long finger of his right hand. “Now let us purify ourselves,” he said, leading every living thing into the ocean: king, warrior, pig, chicken and breadfruit bundle. In the cool sea the voyagers replenished themselves and a canny woman cried, as soon as the job was done, “Do you know what I stood on? Hundreds of shellfish!” And all who were purified fell back into waves and began routing out succulent shellfish. Prying the sweet snails loose, they popped them into their mouths and grinned.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they were satiated, Tupuna announced, “Now we must design the temple,” and the slaves began to tremble. The old man led everyone back to the plateau, and while they watched, he and Tamatoa laid out the four sacred comers of the temple, and large piles of rock were collected about deep holes which the farmers dug.</p>

  <p class="normal">The king signaled his warriors to bury the four quaking slaves, but Teroro prevented the sacrifice. Placing himself before the slaves, he pleaded: “Brother, let us not launch our new island by more killing.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Tamatoa, astonished, explained: “But the temple must be upheld!”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Tane doesn’t require that!” Teroro argued.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But we have always done so.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Isn’t that why we left Havaiki and red Oro?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But that was Oro,” the king rationalized. “This is Tane.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Brother! I beg you! Don’t start this killing!” Then, remembering how his best men had been sacrificed, he pleaded: “Ask the men!”</p>

  <p class="normal">But this was not a question on which Tamatoa could take a vote. It concerned his relationship to the gods; perhaps the entire fortune of the voyage depended on these next few minutes. “Your words are ill timed,” he said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tupuna supported him, grumbling petulantly, “From the beginning of time, temples have been held up by men.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Bury the slaves!” Tamatoa ordered.</p>

  <p class="normal">But again Teroro spread his arms before them and cried, “Brother, don’t do this thing!” Then an idea came to him and he pleaded, “If we must sacrifice to Tane, let us sacrifice the male pig.”</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment the idea was appealing; all knew that Tane loved pig sacrifices more than any other. But Tupuna killed the suggestion. We must keep the boar to breed more pigs,” he said flatly, and all agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But Teroro, impassioned by his desire to start the colony correctly, cried, “Wait! Long ago when we had no pigs, we gave Tane ulua, the man-of-the-sea!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When Tamatoa looked at his uncle for confirmation, the old man nodded. “The gods are pleased with man-of-the-sea,” he admitted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Give me half an hour,” Teroro pleaded, and he took six of his best fishermen, and they waded onto the reef and cast their lines and Teroro prayed, “Ta’aroa, god of the sea and of the fish that live therein, send us ulua to save men’s lives.” And when they had caught eight, two for each corner, they returned to the plateau, and Tamatoa looked at the big handsome fish and said, “For three of the corners we will use the man-of-the-sea. But for the essential corner we will use a man.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please . . .” Teroro began, but the king roared in anger, “Silence! You are in command of the canoe, but I am in command of the temple. What would Tane say if we begrudged him his due?” So, in anxiety of spirit, Teroro left the scene, for he would not be partner to what was about to occur, and if the priest and the king conspired to kill him for his offense, he did not care. He sat on a distant rock and thought: “We flee an evil, but we bring it with us,” and he knew bitterness.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was gone the king said to Mato, “Bury the fish,” and they were placed in three of the holes. Then he directed: “Mato, bring us one of the slaves.” And the warrior went to the six who huddled apart and said bluntly: “I am sent by the king to select one of you to be the spirit for the temple.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Although the slaves were gratified that only one had to die, they were anguished that the choice of that one was forced on them. Looking at one another, they asked, “Which of us shall go to die for our masters?” The six wept, and one who had a position of leadership finally pointed and said, “You, perhaps.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The man identified gasped and steeled himself for his ordeal. First he moved to the leader who had named him and rubbed noses with him, signifying that he went to his death with no hatred. Then he rubbed noses with the other two men, saying to each, “It is better that of the two of us I should die. Between you and me, good friend, it shall be I.” But when he came to the second woman, whom he loved, and when he rubbed noses with her for the last mournful time, he could not speak, and he marched from her to the pit, where he was thrown in, with the stones crushed down upon him, and where earth was pounded about him and over him, and where in silence he met dark death.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the consecration of the temple was completed, and when mana had again begun to flow from the gods into King Tamatoa, so that he could function as king, Tupuna organized his second expedition, and with all save four who guarded the canoe and the animals, he probed deeper into the unknown in search of food. It was not a productive journey, for there was almost no food available. They did come upon a fern whose inner core was just barely edible, and to the fern Tupuna said, “Oh, secret god of this sweet fern, we are hungry. Allow us to borrow your trunk, and we will leave the roots so that you will grow again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">They came upon a taller tree than any they had known in Bora Bora, and Pa observed: “One tree like that would build a house,” so Tupuna reverently prayed, “Mighty tree, we need your wood to build a house. Please let us borrow your strength. See, I plant at your roots a rich ulua for you to eat, and when you are finished, may we come and use your wood?”</p>

  <p class="normal">If they did not find food, they did come upon something almost as good: a cave well up from the reach of the sea, and dry. At its entrance Tupuna buried his last ulua and prayed: “Gods of this cave, please take away any dark things you have left hiding here. Allow me to sprinkle holy water that this place may be sanctified.” Then he entered and called back: “This will be our home.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At this point there came a shout of laughter from the shore, where the pigs had been turned loose, and it was obvious that the old boar still had sea legs, for he would take a few steps, wait for the canoe to surge beneath him, adjust his legs to meet it, and then fall snout-first into the sand. Looking dazed, he would grunt loudly and adjust his wobbly legs for the next roll, only to fall on his face again. The watchers roared with glee and forgot the haunting uncertainties that perplexed them, for the infuriated hog brought them the therapy of laughter, so that when Tupuna cried, “Move everything to the cave!” they responded willingly, and in labor ignored the danger, threatening all of them, that in their new home there might be no food.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when they got to the cave with their burdens, two farmers reported: “There are many birds on this island, good ones,” and as if to prove this claim, overhead flew a line of terns, which ate clean fresh fish, so that when baked they tasted like delicious chicken and bonito, mixed. Tamatoa, looking at the terns, said, “Tane would never have brought us here if there were no food. It may not be the food we have known, but it’s here. Our job is to find it.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, with the temple established and the gods at home, with the great canoe properly beached, and all treasures stowed in the cave, the hungry men who had completed this long voyage began to look at their women, and one by one the emaciated but handsome girls of the long black hair were led into the bushes and cherished, and strange multiple marriages were begun, and new life was launched on the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">But of the women, the fairest could not find her man, for Teroro was brooding by the sea, reflecting on the sacrifice of the slave and its dark portent for the new homeland, so Tehani left the cave and walked down to the sea, crying in vain, “Teroro, Teroro!” until Mato, who so far had no woman of his own and who had sat close to Tehani all the way north, thus seeing her in many lights and appreciating her quality, heard her and ran through the woods until he could, as if by accident, encounter her along the shore. “Can’t you find Teroro?” he asked casually.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Perhaps he has important business,” Mato suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where?” Tehani asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I don’t know. Maybe . . .” He took Tehani’s hand and tried to lead her back into the trees through which he had just run, but she pulled away.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No!” she insisted. “I am a chief’s daughter and a chief’s wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Are you Teroro’s wife?” Mato chided.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?” she demanded, her long hair flashing across her delicate breasts as she turned her head sharply.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I sat very near you on the trip, Tehani,” Mato explained. “It didn’t look to me as if Teroro thought of you as his wife.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“I was tabu,” she explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">“But thinking of you wasn’t tabu,” Mato said. “Teroro never thought of you, Tehani. I did.”</p>

  <p class="normal">He took her hand again, and this time she held on to the ragged young chief, because she knew that what he said was true. “I am very alone,” she confessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Do you know what I think, Tehani? I think you will never be Teroro’s wife. I think he is hungry for his old wife Marama.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Since Tehani shared this suspicion, she experienced a moment of recognition and felt strongly drawn toward Mato and allowed him to pull her into the dark glade away from the shore, and to slip her leafy skirt from her, until in her nakedness she looked at him and realized how desperately she wanted this young man who did not reject her; and he, looking for the first time at her exquisite beauty, diminished though it had been by the voyage, felt a pang of sorrow that such a girl should have been given to a man who did not want her. Gathering her in his arms he whispered, “You are my woman, Tehani.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But when she actually felt his body against hers, and when she heard his words, she grew afraid, for she knew that she was not his woman, and she broke away and ran back to the beach, adjusting hei skirt as she went. Before Mato could overtake her she saw Teroro and ran up to him, crying nervously, “You must make peace with your brother.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And she led her husband back along the ocean front, past where Mato stood bitterly watching her, and onto the plateau where King Tamatoa surveyed the rude temple. At first neither man spoke, but Teroro, looking over his brother’s shoulder, could see the ominous stones resting on fresh earth. He was dismayed but said grudgingly, “This is an appropriate temple, brother. Later we will build a better.” The king nodded, and it was then that Tehani of the long tresses and the flashing eyes led her bewildered husband into the darkness, knowing in her heart that it was another who should have accompanied her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The sexual life of the king was much too important to be conducted in darkness and hidden glades, so on the next day, after the fishermen had brought in their first substantial catch and women had boiled their unpromising pandanus drupes, Tupuna announced that his wife Teura had ascertained that the time of the month was propitious and that their king, Tamatoa, would that afternoon lie with his wife Natabu. That grave and stately woman was then brought forth from beneath a tree, where she had been secluded, and a temporary shelter, made of cut saplings stuck into the ground and covered with the most consecrated tapas, was erected according to ancient custom.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the tent was completed, sedate Natabu, who rarely spoke and who was, by a peculiar combination of omens and good circumstances, the most holy of all the voyagers, was blessed by Tupuna and led into the nuptial area and placed according to ancient custom upon the woven mats. The king was then blessed, and the entire company, including even the five slaves, surrounded the tapa house and chanted. Then, with the prayers and blessings of all the community, the king was taken to the sanctified house, placed inside by the priest, and hidden by the lowered tapa. At this point the prayers mounted in frenzy.</p>

  <p class="normal">The woman with whom the king lay was his sister Natabu. It had been discovered anciently in the islands that for a king to breed a proper heir to the throne, one who would combine the finest lineage and the utmost sanctity, he must mate only with his full-blood sister, and although both Tamatoa and his sister Natabu might later take other spouses, their principal obligation was the production—under circumstances of the most intricate propriety, and under the surveillance of the entire community—of royal descendants.</p>

  <p class="normal">“May the union be fruitful,” old Teura chanted as her niece and nephew lay inside the tapa tent. “May it produce strong kings and princesses blessed with godlike blood.” The crowd prayed: “May this union produce for us a king,” and although they had prayed thus on occasion in the past, when the nuptial tent had been raised over Tamatoa in hopes of breeding an heir, they had never prayed with equal fervor, for it was apparent that in a strange land an heir of the most impeccable lineage was essential, for who else could represent them before the gods if Tamatoa died.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the late afternoon, when the king and his sister left the rude tent, the eyes of the people followed them, and the chants continued, and all prayed that a good thing had been accomplished on that auspicious day.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the nuptial tent was taken down and all omens pertaining to it examined, King Tamatoa faced another major obligation, for he was led by Tupuna to a field into which the farmers had diverted a small stream. This would become the taro bed upon which the community would depend for its basic food, and already the mud walls surrounding it imprisoned a foot of water, making the bottom of the field a deep, soft mass of mud. Standing at the edge, where the stream entered, Tamatoa cried, “May the mana of my body pass through my feet and bless this field!” Whereupon he stepped knee-deep into the muddy water and began trampling the bed. He was joined by Tupuna, Teroro, Mato and Pa, the men with most mana, and for hours they passed back and forth over every inch of the taro patch, hammering the mud into a watertight basin, sealing it with their mana. When they were done Tamatoa shouted, “May this bed be forever sealed. Now plant the taro!”</p>

  <p class="normal">And according to customs more than two thousand years old, the people planted not only the taro, but the breadfruit and the bananas and the pandanus; but for no crop were they as fearful of failure as when they planted coconuts, for to a large extent their entire manner of life was intertwined with this extraordinary tree. When the nuts were young they gave delicious water; when old, a precious oil or a sweet milk. Palms from the coconut thatched many of the houses; hard shells formed cups and utensils, fibers from the husks yielded sennit. Timber from the trunk was used for building and for carving gods; the wiry fiber that grew in the crown was woven into fabric; ribs of the fronds when dried were suitable for starting fires, and sharper ribs, from the leaves, were used in making darts. But most of all, the coconut gave food, and the vocabulary of these people contained twenty-eight different names for the maturing stages of this marvelous nut; from the time when it contained a just-formed, jelly-like substance eaten with scoops by the old or ill to the day when it was a firm, sweet nut.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, when a coconut was planted, the people placed about the nut a baby octopus to hold the resulting tree erect and prayed: “May the king have done a good job this day.”</p>

  <p class="normal">When the crops were planted, a question arose as to what the island should be named, and the warriors, who knew little of omens, agreed that it ought properly to be called Bora Bora; but a great surprise was in store for them, for when Tupuna of the ancient mane heard the report he was outraged. “There is only one name for our island,” he announced stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” the warriors asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Havaiki,” he replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">The settlers were aghast at this suggestion and began to swear that the hated name Havaiki would never exist in their new-found refuge; and both King Tamatoa and Teroro agreed, but the old priest, his white beard long and blowing in the breeze, began the most ancient chant of his people, and no interruption of the king could stay him until he had explained, in words more precious than coconuts, for they summarized the race-experience of his people, and were its soul, who the settlers were: “In ancient times, when great Tane lay with a goddess, the people of the swift canoes were born. They lived then in Havaiki, but it was not the Havaiki we know. It was Havaiki-on-the-Great-Land, and from there King Tamatoa’s father’s father’s father, back to forty generations, led his people in a canoe, and they went to Havaiki-Where-the-Animal-Is-Like-a-Man, and there they lived for many generations, until King Tamatoa’s father’s father’s father, back to thirty generations, led his people in canoes to Havaiki-of-the-Green-Lagoon . . .” And in a wild soaring voice he recalled the search of his people, wandering from one land to another, always seeking an island where they would find peace and coconuts and fish. Always, wherever they landed with their burning hopes, they called their new home Havaiki, and if the new Havaiki treated them badly, it was appropriate that they set forth in search of a better, as their parents had done from time immemorial. Thus, in parables, he spoke of the migration of his ancestors from the interior of Asia, to the north coast of New Guinea, through the Samoan islands and out to distant Tahiti; later men, reconstructing the voyages, would discover more than a dozen Havaikis, but none closer to the ancient dream than the island about to be dedicated.</p>

  <p class="normal">“For us there is only one name,” the old man insisted in a burst of rhetoric. “Havaiki of the manifold riches, Havaiki of the brave canoes, Havaiki of strong gods, and courageous men and beautiful women, Havaiki of the dreams that led us across the endless oceans, Havaiki that has lived in our hearts for forty and fifty and sixty generations. This is the island of Havaiki!”</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was finished, King Tamatoa, who had forgotten his own history, spoke solemnly: “This will be the island of Havaiki, and if you have evil memories of old Havaiki let it be remembered as Havaiki-of-Red-Oro, but our land is Havaiki-of-the-North.” So the island was named Havaiki, the last successor in a mighty chain.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was only when Teroro, accompanied by Mato, Pa and three others, had sailed completely around Havaiki, requiring four days for the exploration, that the settlers appreciated what a magnificent island they had found. “There are two mountains, not one,” Teroro explained, “and many cliffs, and birds of endless number. Rivers come down into the sea, and some of the bays are as inviting as Bora Bora’s lagoon.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But it was blunt Pa who summed up what they had learned: “It looked to us as if we had picked our cave on the worst land in Havaiki.” Gloomily, Mato agreed; but King Tamatoa and his aunt and uncle looked at the newly planted crops and at the temple and said stubbornly, “This is where we have established our home”; but Mato and Pa thought: “If anything should happen, we know where the good land is.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And then the forgotten one appeared. It was on a hot, dusty afternoon when Teroro had gone into the forest seeking birds, that he turned to avoid a tree and found a strange woman confronting him. She was handsome in figure, dressed in a fabric he had not seen before, and her hair, of a strange material that glistened in the sun, stood out like wild grass. She was of his race, yet she was not. With most mournful and condemning eyes she stared at Teroro until he felt his head swimming, but she did not speak. When, in unaccustomed fright, he started to run, she ran with him, and when he stopped, she stopped; but always when he paused, she stared at him in reproach. Finally, she departed in silence, whereupon Teroro regained some of his bravery and ran after her, but she had disappeared.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he returned to the settlement, he was shivering, but for some reason which he could not explain he did not confide his experience to anyone; but sleep did not come to him that night, for he could see the deep-set, fanatic eyes of the woman staring at him in the darkness, so that on the next morning he took Mato aside and said, “I have found some birds. Let’s go into the woods,” and the two young chiefs moved through the trees, and Mato asked, “Where are the birds?” And suddenly the gaunt, distracted woman stood before them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who is this?” Mato asked, astonished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“She came to me yesterday. I think she wants to speak.”</p>

  <p class="normal">But the woman said nothing, content merely with admonishing the young men by her wild stare, so that Teroro said to his companion, “When we move, she will move with us.” And certainly, when the warriors started walking under the trees, she walked with them, her garments disheveled and her strange hair glistening in the sun. Then, as they watched, she vanished.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Where did she go?” Mato cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Woman! Woman!” Teroro called, vainly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The two young men consulted as to whether they should advise the others, and it was finally decided that they should, so they went first to old, red-eyed Teura and said, “In the trees we met a strange woman with different hair . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">Before they could finish, the old woman burst into a long wail, “Auwe, auwe! It is Pere! She has come to destroy us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The old woman’s husband hurried in and she announced: “They have seen Pere, of the burning fire!” And when the king arrived at the commotion she warned him: “The forgotten one has come to punish us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Auwe!” the king mourned, for he perhaps best of all understood the unforgivable error they had committed in abandoning a goddess who had warned them beforehand that she wished to accompany them, and he decided that the entire community must assemble at the temple to pray for respite from the goddess. But the prayer was not uttered, for at this moment the earth began to shake violently.</p>

  <p class="normal">In a manner unknown to the strangers, the red earth of Havaiki rose and fell, twisted and heaved, and cracks appeared through the heart of the settlement, and pigs squealed. “Oh, Pere!” the king cried in terror. “Spare us!” And his prayer must have had power, for the trembling stopped, and the horrified voyagers huddled together to decipher this mighty omen.</p>

  <p class="normal">They did not succeed, for a much greater was about to envelop them. From the mountain that reached high above their heads volumes of fire began to erupt, and rocks were thrown far into the air, Scattered ash fell back onto the earth and settled on the king’s head and on the newly planted banana shoots. All day the fires continued, and into the night, so that the undersides of the clouds that hung over the islands shone red, as if even they were ablaze.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a night of terror, fearful in its strangeness and paralyzing in its power. The settlers gathered at the shore and hovered near West Wind, thinking that if the land caught fire, they might escape in it, and when the eruptions grew worse, Tupuna insisted that the king and Natabu, at least, be sent out to the safety of the sea, and it was because of this foresight that the colony was saved, for Teroro dispatched Hiro and Pa with the canoe, and when it was a mile out to sea, lighted by the blazing mountain, a great ocean wave sped toward shore, and if the canoe had not already reached the sea, its appropriate element, the onrushing wave would have destroyed it.</p>

  <p class="normal">As it was, the water swept far inland, and tore down the temple and uprooted many of the crops. In its swirling return to the sea, it dragged with it one of the pigs, most of the bananas and old, red-eyed Teura. The goddess had warned her, but she had failed to interpret the dream correctly, so that when the turbulent sea reached far inland to grab her, twisting her this way and that, she was not afraid. Committing herself entirely to the gods, she whispered into the engulfing waves, “Great Ta’aroa, keeper of the sea, you have come for me and I am ready.” As she was dragged across the reef, the green water rushing over her, she smiled and was relaxed, for she was certain that somewhere out beyond the coral she would encounter her personal god, Mano, the wild blue shark. “Mano!” she cried at last. “I am coming to talk with you!” And she was carried far from land.</p>

  <p class="normal">When dawn rose, accompanied by new explosions of ash and flame, King Tamatoa studied his stricken community, and he could explain the ravages, especially the fallen temple, only by the fact that no slaves had been planted alive at three of the corners, but Teroro would not tolerate such reasoning.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are punished because we forgot our most ancient goddess, and because we built in the wrong place,” he insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">How wrong the place was would now be proved, for Mato came running with the news that up on the side of the mountain a creeping wall of fire was slowly descending toward the settlement. A dozen men went back into the trees and climbed toward where Mato had pointed, and they saw a fearful thing: above them, and marching over all obstacles on its way to the sea, came a relentless wall of fiery rock and molten lava, turning over and over upon itself, devouring trees and rocks and valleys. Its ugly snout, thirty feet high, was not ablaze and seemed dead, until it struck a dried tree, whereupon flames leaped mysteriously into the air. At intervals long tongues of molten rock spurted through the ominously creeping front and spread out like water. It was obvious that crawling monster must soon devour the entire community.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It will be upon us by tomorrow,” the men calculated.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was satisfied with the news, King Tamatoa reacted without fear, for his brother’s bold words had strengthened him. He commanded: “We will first pray for the old woman Teura,” and he blessed her to the gods. When this was finished he said calmly, “All planted things will be dug up immediately and wrapped carefully, even if you must use your own clothes.” Then he showed the slaves bow to load the canoe, and when, at a distance of less than three miles, the molten lava began pouring over a low cliff, like a flaming waterfall, he, studied it for a long time. Then he said, “We will stay ashore tonight and get all things ready. In the morning we will leave this place. Pa says he has found a promising land to the west.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Through the night the settlers worked, seeing one another in the dim flares of the volcano, and when dawn came they were ready to go. They had recovered much of their seed, and had saved their gods, their pigs and their canoe. With these they escaped, but when they were safe at sea, they saw the vast, fiery front of the lava break through onto their plateau, where it ate its way impersonally across all things. The temple site was burned away in a flash; the fields where crops had rested were gone; the taro patch was filled with fire; and the cave disappeared behind a wall of flame. From the plateau, the cascade of fire found a valley leading down into the sea, and after building its strength aloft, it plunged down this avenue and poured into the ocean. When it struck the water it hissed and groaned: it threw columns of steam into the air and exploded the waves; it sent noisy reports of its triumph and filled the sky with ash; and then, conquered by the patient and accommodating ocean, it fell silently into dark caverns, as it had been doing here for the past thirty million years.</p>

  <p class="normal">The men of Havaiki, seeing for the first time the incredible fury of which their new land was capable, sat awestruck in their canoe and watched for a long time the cataclysm that had destroyed their home; but a gust of wind, stronger than the rest, carried down from the crest of the volcano a wisp of hair, spun by the breezes from the molten lava, and Teroro caught the hair and held it aloft, where the sun played on it, and he saw that it was the hair which the strange woman in the forest had worn, and he announced: “It was the goddess Pere. She came not to frighten us but to warn us. We did not understand.”</p>

  <p class="normal">His words gave the people in the canoe great hope, for if the goddess had thought enough of her erring people to warn them, she must retain some love for them; and all was not lost. This hair of Pere was given to the king as an omen, and he placed it upon the neck of the only remaining bred sow, because if this animal did not live and deliver her litter it would be as bad an omen as the volcano.</p>

  <p class="normal">In this manner, but bearing only half the cargo with which they had arrived, and a bred sow clothed in Pere’s hair, the voyagers started for a new home; and Pa and Mato had chosen wisely, for they led their companions around the southern tip of the island and up the western coast until they found fine land, with soil that could be tilled, and water, and it was here that the settlement of Havaiki began in earnest, with new fields and a new temple built without sacrifices. When the sow threw her litter, the king himself watched over the young pigs, and when the largest and strongest reached a size at which he could have been eaten—and mouths had begun to water for the taste of roast pig—the king and old Tupuna carried the pig reverently to the new temple and sacrificed it to Tane. From then on the community prospered.</p>

  <p class="normal"><span>WHEN THE SETTLEMENT</span> was established, Tupuna took the steps which were to give it the characteristics which marked it permanently. He said one day to the king, “Soon I shall follow Teura, but before I go upon the rainbow, we ought to protect the life of our people. It is not good that men roam freely everywhere, and live without restraint.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“For a few months, pernaps,” tne priest argued. “Just as the years pass, unless a community has fixed laws, and patterns which bind people into their appointed place, life is no good.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“But this is a new land,” Teroro reasoned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“It is in a new land that customs are most necessary,” the priest warned, and the king supported him, and out of their discussions the tabus were established.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Each man lives between an upper, which gives mana, and a lower, which drains mana from him,” Tupuna explained in words that would never be forgotten. “Therefore a man must plead with the upper to send him mana and must protect himself from the lower, which steals mana from him. That is why no man should permit a slave to touch him, or to pass upon his shadow, or to see his food, for a slave can drain away a man’s entire mana in an instant, for a slave has no mana.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The way for a man to obtain mana is to obey his king, for it is the king alone who can bring us mana directly from the gods. Therefore no man may touch tie king, or the garment of the king, or the shadow of the king, or in any way steal his mana. To break this tabu is death.” Tupuna then enumerated more than five dozen additional tabus which protected the king in his suspension between the upper gods and the lower men: his spittle may not be touched; his excrement must be buried at night in a secret place; his food must be prepared only by chiefs; his reservoir of mana must be protected; he is tabu, he is tabu.</p>

  <p class="normal">Men with mana required protection from defilement by women, who usually had none. Since men were of the light, and women of darkness; since men were outgoing and strong, and women intaking and weak; since men were clean and women impure; since it was nightly proved that even the strongest man could be slyly drained of his power by a clever woman, dreadful tabus were set about the latter. They must never eat with men, nor see men eating, nor touch food intended for men, on pain of death. Each month they must spend the moon-days locked up in a tiny room, on pain of death. They must eat none of the good foods required to keep men strong: no pig, no sweet fish, no coconuts, on pain of death. “And since the banana has obviously been created by the gods to represent man’s fertility,” Tupuna wailed, “no woman may even touch a banana, on pain of instant strangulation.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The days of the moon, the turning of the season and the planting of crops were all placed under tabu. So were laughing at improper moments, certain sex habits, the eating of certain fish and the ridicule of either gods or nobles. Tabu was the temple, tabu were the rock-gods, tabu was the hair of Pere, tabu was the growing coconut tree. At some seasons, even the ocean itself was tabu, on pain of death.</p>

  <p class="normal">In this manner, and with the approval of the people, who wanted to be organized within established levels, the tabus were promulgated and patterns were developed whereby each man would know his level and none would transgress. What had been a free volcanic island, explosive with force, now became a rigidly determined island, and all men liked it better, for the unknown was made known.</p>

  <p class="normal">It is not quite true to say that all men were content. One was not. Teroro, as the king’s younger brother, was the logical man to become priest when old Tupuna died. He had inherited great sanctity and was growing into an able if not a clever man; there was no greater astronomer than he, and it was tacitly understood that he would in time become guardian of the tabus.</p>

  <p class="normal">But he was far from the dedication required for this exacting job. Instead of the equanimity that marked the king, Teroro was torn with uncertainties, and they centered upon women. Day after day, when he wandered in the woods, he would come upon Pere, her shining hair disheveled and her eyes deep-sunk. She said nothing, but walked with him as a woman walks with a man she loves. Often, after her appearance, the volcano would erupt, but what lava flows there were, went down the other side of the mountain and did not endanger the growing settlement, where many pigs roamed, and chickens, and sweet, succulent dogs; for Tamatoa and Natabu had done their work well and had produced a son.</p>

  <p class="normal">Only Teroro did not prosper; often he would turn the corner of a well-known footpath, and there would be silent Pere, hurt, condemnatory and yet speaking her love for her troubled young chief. Always, in the background of his mind, there was Pere.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet his real agony concerned not a shadowy goddess, but a substantial woman, and this was Marama, his wife whom he had abandoned in Bora Bora. He thought: “How wise of her to speak as she did on that last day!” For he could hear her voice as clear as it had been a year ago: “I am the canoe!” It seemed to him almost godlike wisdom on Marama’s part to have used that idiom; for she was the canoe. Her placid face and sweet wisdom had been the continuing thread of his life; over all the waves and through the storms she had indeed been the canoe. And for the first time, here on remote Havaiki, Teroro began to understand how desperately a man can remember a strong, placid, wise woman whom he had known before. She was the symbol of earth, the movement of waves, the song at night. Hers was the weight that rested in memory; her words were recalled. He could see the movement of her skirts, and the way she wore her hair; once on Bora Bora when he had been sick she had washed his fever and he could recall her cool hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">In consternation he remembered that on the canoe young Tehani had done the same; but it was different. He had never known with older Marama one fifth of the sexual excitement he had experienced with Tehani; and yet his mind was tormented by his wife. He would see her at night when he returned from his silent walks with Pere. In his dreams he would hear Marama speak. And whenever he saw Wait-for-the-West-Wind, that perfect canoe, he would see Marama, for she had said, “I am the canoe!” And she was.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this mood that one morning he dashed from his thatched hut where Tehani slept and ran to Mato, at the fishing grounds. Grabbing the surprised chief by the hand he dragged him to the hut, and jerked Tehani to her feet. “She is your woman, Mato,” he shouted with unnecessary force.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Teroro!” the young girl cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You are no longer my woman!” Teroro shouted. “I watched you on the canoe. Mato never took his eyes from you. All right, Mato, now she is yours.” And he stalked from the scene.</p>

  <p class="normal">That afternoon, in torment of spirit, he sought out his brother and said simply, “I shall go back to Bora Bora.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The king was not surprised, for he had been watching his brother and news of his rejection of Tehani had been discussed with old Tupuna, who had said that Teroro was ill in spirit. “Why will you go? Tamatoa asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I must bring Marama here,” the younger man said. “We need more breadfruit, more dogs, everything. We need more people.”</p>

  <p class="normal">A council was held and all agreed that a trip south could prove helpful, especially if foodstuffs were brought back. “But who can be spared for such a long voyage?” Tupuna asked, and Teroro replied that he could sail West Wind to Bora Bora with only six men, if Pa and Hiro were two of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I’ll go,” Mato insisted, but Teroro growled, “We have treated Tehani badly. You stay with her.” And he would not take Mato, his greatest friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">So the return trip was authorized, and the community began assembling its pitiful stores of spare food. This time there was no dried taro, no coconut, no breadfruit, no bamboo lengths to carry water. There were, fortunately, some bananas, but they did not dry and carry well. Dried fish there was in plenty, and on this the men would exist.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the food was collected, Teroro divulged his plan. Drawing a rough pattern of the trip north, he pointed out that the canoe had sailed far east, then north, then far west. With a bold line in the sand he cut across this pattern and said, “We will sail directly south, and we will find the island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There will be no storm winds to aid you,” Tupuna warned.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We will ride with the currents,” Teroro replied, “and we will paddle.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the last day before departure, Teroro was sitting alone when one of the village women came to him and said plaintively, “On the return, if there is room in the canoe, will you please bring one thing for me?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What?” Teroro asked. “A child,” the woman said. “Whose child?” he inquired.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Any child,” the woman replied, adding softly, “It is woeful to be in a land where there are no children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It was impractical to bring a child so far, and Teroro said so, and dismissed the woman, but in a little while another came to him, saying, “Why should you bring pigs and breadfruit, Teroro? What our hearts ache for is children.” And he sent her away.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the women came again, and while they did not weep, there were tears in their throats as they spoke: “We are growing older, all of us. You and the king and Tupuna and all of us. There are babies, to be sure, but we need children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“There are no children playing along the shore,” another said. “Do you remember how they played in our lagoon?” And suddenly Teroro could see the lagoon at Bora Bora with hundreds of brown, naked children in the green waters, and he realized why Havaiki-of-the-North had seemed so barren.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Please,” the women pleaded, “bring us back some children.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, on the night of departure, for Teroro insisted upon leaving when the stars were visible, he confided to his brother: “I am not going solely for Marama. I am going to bring back the stone of Pere. I think an island should have not only men gods, but women, too.”</p>

  <p class="normal">On the long voyage south, while his men starved and grew parched in the doldrums, Teroro put together the rough chant that would be remembered in the islands for generations after his death and which served to guide subsequent canoes from Tahiti to the new Havaiki:</p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Wait for the west wind, wait for the west wind!</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Then sail to Nuku Hiva of the dark bays</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>To find the constant star.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Hold to it, hold to it,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Though the eyes grow dim with heat.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Hold to it, hold to it,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Till wild Ta’aroa sends the winds.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Then speed to the clouds where Pere waits.</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Watch for her flames, the flames of Pere,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Till great Tane brings the land,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Brings Havaiki-of-the-North,</em></p>

  <p class="normal"><em>Sleeping beneath the Little Eyes.</em></p>

  <p class="normal">But when the chant was finished, Teroro realized with some dismay that finding the home islands was not going to be easy, and he missed them altogether at first, reaching all the way down to Tahiti before he discovered where he was. Then, beating his way back north, he found Havaiki-of-Red-Oro, and there at sea, in the gently rolling swells, the seven men held a council of war. Teroro posed the problem simply: “If we sail into Bora Bora without a plan, the High Priest, who must know about our attack on Oro, will command his men to kill us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We’ve got to risk it,” Pa growled.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We are very weak,” Teroro pointed out.</p>

  <p class="normal">“We can still fight,” Pa insisted.</p>

  <p class="normal">“There is a better way,” Teroro argued, and with a newly developing sense of guile he reasoned: “Since we’re not strong enough to fight the High Priest, we must outsmart him.” And he suggested a way, but his men thought of other things when in the dawn they saw once more the pinnacles of Bora Bora and the wild cliffs dropping away to the lagoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pa muttered, “We must have been insane to leave this place for Havaiki-of-the-North.” And each man in the canoe acknowledged the fact that he had surrendered earth’s paradise in exchange for a harsh new land.</p>

  <p class="normal">As soon as Wait-for-the-West-Wind was spotted standing off the western entrance into the lagoon, the residents of its home port began to line the shores and shout with joy at the return of their people. It was this joy that Teroro counted upon to give him ten minutes’ respite to develop his plan, because he believed that the islanders’ spontaneous acceptance of the canoe would prevent the High Priest from ordering the crew’s immediate death, and in that interval Teroro would have time to accomplish his mission.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the canoe neared land he warned his men again: “I’ll talk, but you must look pious.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And promptly the bow of the canoe struck land, he leaped ashore and cried, “We seek the High Priest!” and when that dignitary, older and more solemn, with flecks of white in his beard, approached, Teroro made deep obeisance and cried for all to hear, We come as servants of Oro, seeking another god for our distant land. Bless us, august one, and send us another god.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The plea took the High Priest so by surprise, coming as it did even before any narration of the journey, that he was unable to mask his pleasure, and the staff with which he could have directed the sacrifice of the crew remained rooted in the ground, and he listened as Teroro spoke rapidly: “Under Oro we have prospered, august one, and our community grows. But life is difficult and we live scattered. That is why your servant old Tupuna requires additional gods. When we have borrowed them from you, we will depart.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The High Priest listened, and then stood aside as the new king of Bora Bora appeared, and Teroro saw with intense pleasure that the man was not from “Havaiki, as planned, but from Bora Bora. “King,” he cried, “forgive us for our midnight assault on Havaiki before our departure. We did this thing not to dishonor great Oro, but to prevent a Havaiki man from becoming king of Bora Bora. Forgive us.” And Teroro was so weak, and so urgently in need of food and help, that he kneeled in the dust, and prostrated himself before the king, and then before the High Priest, and to his deep satisfaction he heard from the canoe the pious voice of Pa intoning: “Now let us go to the temple of Oro and give thanks for our safe voyage.” But as the men marched, Teroro caught sight of a woman at the edge of the crowd, a tall, solemn, patient woman with a face like a moon, and he thought no more of gods or kings or priests, for the woman was Marama, and solely by looking at each other, intently and with the love that consumes two thousand miles of ocean, she knew that he had come to take her with him, and while he prayed to a god whom he detested, she went to her grass house and started packing.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the prayers were over he joined her there, and they sat in silence, profound communion passing between them, and she was both forgiving and consoling in the disappointing moments when they found him too exhausted with famine even to make love with her. She laughed softly and said, from the edge of the house, “See what happened on the last night we made love.” And she took from a maid’s arms a boy nearly a year old, with wide eyes and dark hair like his father’s.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tororo looked at his son, and at the wife he had left behind because she could bear no children, and in his embarrassment he began to laugh. Marama laughed too, and teased: “You looked so ridiculous out there, praying to Oro. And Pa putting on that long face! ‘Now let us go to the temple of Oro!’ It was a good idea, Teroro, but it wasn’t necessary.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do you mean?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Haven’t you noticed how much older the High Priest looks? He has been very badly treated.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“That’s good news. How?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“After all his scheming to banish you and Tamatoa, so that he could become the chief priest at Havaiki …”</p>

  <p class="normal">“You mean, they were just using him? To subdue Bora Bora?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Yes. They had no intention of making him chief priest. After you killed your wife’s father . . .”</p>

  <p class="normal">“She’s not my wife. I gave her to Mato.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Marama paused for a moment and looked at the floor. Quietly, she added, “The men of Havaiki tried to give us a new king, but we fought.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Then why do you keep the High Priest?”</p>

  <p class="normal">“We need a priest,” she said simply. “Every island needs a priest.” And they fell silent, listening to the soft waves of the lagoon, and after a long while Teroro said, “You must find a dozen women who will go with us. It’s a hard journey.” Then he added, “And this time we’ll take some children with us.” His voice brightened. “We’ll take the little fellow.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Marama said. “He’s too young. We’ll trade him for an older boy,” and in the island tradition she went from house to house, until she found an eight-year-old boy she liked, and to his willing mother she gave her son. When Teroro saw the new boy, he liked him too, and after the child was sent away to wait for the canoe’s departure, he took his wife in his arms and whispered, “You are the canoe of my life, Marama. In you I make my voyage.”</p>

  <p class="normal">At the consecration of the new idol of Oro, the High Priest insisted upon killing a slave, and Teroro hid his face in shame, for he and his men knew that once the reef was breasted, the idol would pitch into the sea, so that when the High Priest delivered the god to the becoming-priest Teroro, the latter took it gravely, not as an idol but as a symbol of the needless death of a man; and whether he or the crew liked the statue or not, it had somehow become a thing of sanctification, and Teroro treated it as such, for it spoke to him of blood. At the same time it reminded him of the difficulty which now faced him: he had to get the red-rock statue of the goddess Pere from the temple without exciting the High Priest’s suspicion that that had been the real reason for the return. In secrecy he held council with Pa and Hiro to canvass the ways by which Pere might be kidnaped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pa suggested: “You fooled the priests with your talk of Oro. Fool them again.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Teroro replied. “We were able to fool them about Oro because they wanted to believe. To mention a forgotten goddess like Pere would arouse their suspicions.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Could we steal it?” Hiro proposed.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Who knows where it is?” Teroro countered. They discussed other possibilities and agreed upon only one thing: to return to Havaiki-of-the-North without Pere would be insane, for since she had warned them once with such a distastrous wall of fire, the next time she would obliterate them altogether. It was then that Teroro proposed: “I shall talk with Marama. She is a very wise woman.”</p>

  <p class="normal">And it was Marama who devised the plan. “The island knows that you have come back for me,” she pointed out, “and they recall that my ancestors were priests. When the women for our voyage have been gathered, two of us will go to the High Priest and tell him that we want to take one of the ancient Bora Bora gods with us.”</p>

  <p class="normal">“Will he allow it?” Teroro asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">“He is a priest of Oro,” Marama pointed out, “but he is also a Bora Boran, and he will understand our love of this island.”</p>

  <p class="normal">It worked exactly as she planned, but when the time came for delivering the feather-draped red rock of Pere, the High Priest could not bring himself to place such treasure in the hands of a woman, insisting upon transferring the goddess directly to Teroro, and when the latter at last had the soul of Pere in his possession, the wild, passionate soul of the fire goddess, the mother of volcanoes, he wanted to shout in triumph, but instead he laid it aside as if it were only a woman’s god, a whim of his wife’s, and the High Priest thought the same.</p>

  <p class="normal">The men were fattened and the food was packed. Twelve women were selected and put on starvation diets to prepare them for the voyage. King Tamatoa’s favorite wife was included, for everyone agreed that since their king had produced with his sister a royal heir of greatest sanctity, he should be encouraged to import at least one woman he loved. For seed crops the crew emphasized pigs, bananas and breadfruit. “How we yearn for sweet breadfruit,” they explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">When all was ready, Terroro was startled to see Marama lugging toward the canoe a large bundle wrapped in leaves. “What’s that?” he cried.</p>

  <p class="normal">“Flowers,” his wife replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">“What do we want with flowers?” Teroro protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“I asked Pa and he said there were no flowers.” Teroro looked at the other crew members, and they realized for the first time that Havaiki-of-the-North owned no natural blooms. Even so, the bundle seemed excessively large.</p>

  <p class="normal">“You simply can’t take that much, Marama,” he protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">“The gods like flowers,” she replied. “Throw out one of the pigs.”</p>

  <p class="normal">The idea was so offensive that the crew would not consider it, but they did compromise on this: they would put back one of the smaller breadfruit, but they all considered Teroro’s woman demented.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then came the task, most joyous and exciting of all, of selecting the children. The men wanted to take only girls, while the women wished only boys, so that the compromise of half and half pleased no one but did have certain sense to commend it. The ten children selected ranged from four years old to twelve: dark-haired, deep-eyed, grinning, white-toothed children. Their very presence made the canoe lighter.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when all had stepped aboard, Teroro was unaccountably depressed by the gravity or the task he had undertaken, and this time with no guile he went gravely to the High Priest and pleaded: “Bless our journey. Establish the tabus.” And the High Priest arranged the gods on the side of the voyagers and cried in a high voice, touching the food for the animals, “This is tabul This is tabu!” And when he had finished, the canoe somehow seemed safer, and it set forth for the long voyage north.</p>

  <p class="normal">It had barely escaped from the lagoon when Pa, the shark-faced, went for the offensive statue of Oro, to throw it into the deep, but to his surprise Teroro restrained him and said, “It is a god! We will place it reverently on the shore of Havaiki-of-Red-Oro,” and when he had led the canoe to that once-hated island, slipping ashore where no lookouts could intercept him, he placed Oro in a sheltered position among rocks, and built a palm-leaf canopy; and he was overcome with the awareness that never again would he see Havaiki, from which he had sprung, and while the canoe waited, he stood on the shore of the ancestral island and chanted the story of the brave, lost people of Havaiki-in-Asia, who had set out upon innumerable voyages, never to return. This was his land, his home, and he would know it no more.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pa and his rugged crew were further surprised when it came time to set the course back to Havaiki-of-the-North. This time Teroro would not permit them to follow his earlier reckless path far out to sea; he required them to take the cautious route to Nuku Hiva, where in all prudence they replenished their stores, so that in the heartbreaking doldrums they had adequate food and water, especially for the children, who suffered intensely in the heat, for try as they might, they could not make their stomachs into tight hard knots. They were hungry and they said so.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last the stars of the Little Eyes were overhead, and the canoe turned joyously westward before the wind. Now Teroro conducted daily lessons for every man and boy aboard the canoe: “You know the island lies ahead. What signals will prove the fact?” And every male above the age of six became a navigator, and Marama, taking the place of old red-eyed Teura, became the seer, collecting omens; and one day a boy spotted a black fork-tailed bird attacking a gannet, who had caught a fish; and Teroro showed all how to read the wave echoes as they bounced back from unseen Havaiki; but the most solemn moment came when Marama, reading her clouds, saw fire upon them, and she knew that the goddess Pere had lighted a beacon for her voyagers, and it was to this cloud of fire that Teroro directed his canoe.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the craft neared shore Teroro faced one last odious job, but he discharged it. Moving among the men and women he told each: “The children are no longer yours. They must be shared with those on shore, and each child shall have many mothers.”</p>

  <p class="normal">Immediately a wailing set up, for on the long voyage men and women in the canoe had grown inordinately attached to the children, and the wild young things had found mothers and fathers whom they liked. “He is more than my son!” a woman cried, holding to her breast a nine-year-old boy with a broken tooth.</p>

  <p class="normal">“No,” Teroro said firmly. “If it had not been for the women on shore, pleading for children, I would not have thought to bring any. They must have their share. It is only just.”</p>

  <p class="normal">So when the canoe landed, there was a moment of intense anguish as the women from shore, too long without the sound of children, hurried down and saw the boys standing awkwardly by the mast and the little girls holding onto men’s hands. The women on shore could not see the new pigs or the promising breadfruit or the bananas. All they could see were the children, and when the first child stepped ashore, a woman ran frenziedly to him with food, but the child drew back.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in this manner that Teroro, bearing in his hands the rock of Pere, stepped ashore to become the compassionate and judicious priest of Havaiki, with his gentle wife Marama as associate and seer, and with the volcano goddess as his special mentor. The pigs and the breadfruit and the children increased. Marama’s flowers burst into brilliance. And the island prospered.</p>
