  <h1>BOOK ELEVEN:<br/>The Dome</h1>

  <p class="normal">On All Saints' Eve, exactly twenty-nine years after Pope Julius had consecrated the ceiling with a special ceremony, Pope Paul said high mass to celebrate the completion of the Last Judgment.</p>

  <p class="normal">On Christmas Day, 1541, the chapel was thrown open to the public. Rome streamed through the Sistine, terrified, shocked, awe-stricken. The studio in the Macello dei Corvi was thronged with Florentines, cardinals, courtiers, artists and apprentices. When the last of the guests had disappeared Michelangelo realized that two groups had not been represented: Antonio da Sangallo and the artists and architects who centered around him, remnants of the Bramante-Raphael coterie; and Cardinal Caraffa and his followers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Very soon war was declared. An unfrocked monk, Bernardino Ochino, censured Pope Paul by demanding:</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can Your Holiness allow such an obscene painting as that of Michelangelo's to remain in a chapel where the divine office is sung?"</p>

  <p class="normal">But when Michelangelo returned to the Sistine the following day he found half a dozen artists sitting on low stools sketching and copying. The Pope rallied to his support by asking him to fresco two virtually twenty-foot-square walls of the chapel named after him, the Pauline, designed and recently completed by Antonio da Sangallo between the Sistine and St. Peter's. The chapel was ponderously top-heavy, the two overhead windows affording insufficient light, but the walls were attractively set off by reddish Corinthian pillars. Pope Paul wanted a Conversion of Paul on one wall, a Crucifixion of Peter on the opposite.</p>

  <p class="normal">While thinking through the imagery of the Conversion, Michelangelo spent his days with hammer and chisel. He sculptured a head of Brutus, which the Florentine colony had been urging. He articulated the thick curls on Moses' head, carving at the forefront the two horns, or rays of light, which the Old Testament attributed to Moses. With the heat of midsummer, he moved two marbles out to the bricked garden terrace from which to carve a Rachel and a Leah, Contemplative and Active Life, for the two niches alongside the Moses; niches which, in his redesigning of Julius' single-wall tomb, had become too small to hold the Heroic Captive and Dying Captive. He finished the sketches for the Virgin, Prophet and Sibyl which would complete the monument, then sent for Raffaello da Montelupo, who had carved the St. Damian for the Medici chapel, to sculpture them. With the two Captives no longer part of the design, and the four unfinished Giants and Victory still in Florence, it was Ercole Gonzaga who was proving to be the prophet. The Moses alone would be the majesty of Julius' tomb, and represent his best carving. Was it, as the Cardinal of Mantua had said, "sufficient monument for any man"?</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo wondered what Jacopo Galli would have said about his finishing the tomb with only one major work of the original forty he had contracted for.</p>

  <p class="normal">He decided that Urbino had earned his independence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Urbino, you're past thirty now, and it's time you began making money for yourself. The Pope has agreed to pay you eight ducats a month for grinding the colors when I paint his chapel. Would you like also to contract for the construction of the tomb wall?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, <i>messere, </i>for I must begin putting away money against my marriage. The family that bought my parental home in Urbino, they have a little girl... in about ten years she will make a good wife...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He sorely missed Vittoria Colonna. In the deep of night he wrote her long letters, frequently sending a sonnet or a drawing. At first Vittoria replied promptly, but as his letters became more urgent she answered less frequently. To his anguished cry of "Why?" she replied:</p>

  <p class="versi">Magnificent Messer Michelangelo:</p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">I did not reply earlier to your letter, because it was, as one might say, an answer to my last: for I thought that if you and I were to go on writing without intermission, according to my obligation and your courtesy, I should have to neglect the chapel of St. Catherine here, and be absent at the appointed hours for company with my sisterhood, while you would have to leave the chapel of St. Paul and be absent from morning through the day.... Thus we should both of us fail in our duty.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">He felt crushed, chagrined, as though he were a small boy who had been reproved. He continued to write passionate poems to her... but did not send them, contenting himself with scraps of news brought by travelers from Viterbo. When he learned that she was ill and rarely left her room, his sense of mortification turned to anxiety. Did she have good medical attention? Was she taking proper care of herself?</p>

  <p class="normal">He was depleted, tired, at loose ends; yet all the loose ends had to be tied together securely. He laid a new plaster wall in the Pauline chapel; deposited fourteen hundred ducats in the bank of Montauto to be paid out to Urbino and Raffaelo da Montelupo as they made progress with the tomb. He drew a modest design for the Conversion of Paul, with some fifty figures and an additional number of faces surrounding Paul as he lay on the ground, having been struck by a shaft of yellow light coming down from heaven, the first New Testament miracle he had ever painted. He carved the Rachel and Leah, two tender, lovely young women, heavily swathed in robes, symbolic figures; and for the first time since the Piccolomini statues he was carving marbles in which he had no genuine interest. They appeared to him watered down in emotional intensity, without the throbbing, self-contained core of energy to grip and dominate the space about them.</p>

  <p class="normal">His studio and garden had been turned into a busy workshop, with half a dozen young people helping Urbino and Raffaelo da Montelupo to finish the tomb. He was delighted to find a number of the Jews of Rome, some of whom reported that they were sons or grandsons of the men who had posed for his first Pietà, asking permission to come to the studio to see the Moses. They stood before their great teacher caught between pride and wonder, their lips silently murmuring something which Michelangelo knew could not be prayers, since the Ten Commandments forbade it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The present and future had shape for him only in terms of work to be done. How many more works of art could he live? The Conversion of St. Paul would take so many years, the Crucifixion of St. Peter so many more. Better to count the projects ahead than the days; then he would not tick off the years one by one as though they were coins he was counting into the hands of a wary merchant. Simpler to think of time as creativity: the two Pauline frescoes, then a Descent from the Cross he wanted to carve for his own pleasure from the last of his magnificent Carrara blocks... God would not be inclined to interrupt an artist in the midst of begetting.</p>

  <p class="normal">He consumed time as smoothly as he drank a cup of water: a few days represented a servant trying to restrain Paul's frightened horse; a week involved a wingless angel, a month conceived Paul, stricken by the light from Christ's hand; a year meant the massing of figures on one side of Paul, soldiers and companions, some terrorized, some trying to flee, some gazing upward in their consternation. What better way to tell time than through the body of content?</p>

  <p class="normal">A Committee of Inquisition had been established in Rome. Cardinal Caraffa, who had lived a morally upright life as a priest in the corrupt court of the Borgia Pope, Alexander VI, had attracted power against the will and wishes of those who served him. Though he boasted that he never made himself agreeable to anyone, that he turned away roughly everyone who asked favors; though he was choleric in temperament and painfully thin of face and body, his burning zeal for the dogma of the Church was making him the most influential leader of the College of Cardinals; respected, feared and obeyed. His Committee of Inquisition had already established an Index which said what books could be printed and read.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria Cblonna returned to Rome and entered the convent of San Silvestro in Capite near the Pantheon. Michelangelo did not think she should have left the safety of Viterbo. He pressed for a meeting. Vittoria refused. He accused her of cruelty; she replied that it was a kindness. Finally, from sheer persistence, he gained her assent... only to find that her strength and her beauty had been ravaged. Her illness and the pressure of the accusations against her had aged her twenty years. She had passed from a lovely, robust, vibrant woman to one whose face was lined, lips dry and pale, the green eyes sunk in their sockets, the rich copper gone from her hair. She was sitting alone in the convent garden, her hands folded in her lap, her head veiled. He was overcome.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I tried to save you from this," she murmured.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You think my love so shallow?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even in your kindness there is a cruel revelation."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Life is cruel, never love."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Love is the crudest of all. I know..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know only a fragment," he interrupted. "Why have you kept us apart? And why have you returned to this dangerous atmosphere?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I must make my peace with the Church, find forgiveness for my sins against her."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sins?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. I disobeyed, indulged my own vain opinions against the divine doctrine, harbored dissenters...."</p>

  <p class="normal">His throat locked. Another echo from the past. He remembered the anguish with which he had listened to the dying Lorenzo de' Medici pleading for absolution from Savonarola, the man who had destroyed his Plato Academy. He heard again his brother Lionardo's disavowal of Savonarola's disobedience to the Borgia Pope. Was there no unity between living and dying?</p>

  <p class="normal">"My last desire is to die in grace," Vittoria was saying, quietly. "I must return to the bosom of the Church, like a child to the bosom of its mother. Only there can I find redemption."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your illness has done this to you," he cried. "The Inquisition has tortured you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have tortured myself, inside my own mind. Michelangelo, I worship you as God-given among men. But you too, before your death, will have to seek salvation."</p>

  <p class="normal">He listened to the noise of the bees as they buzzed in the cups of the flowers. His heart ached for her despair. They were still alive on the face of the earth. She spoke as though they were already dead. He said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"My feelings for you, which you would never allow me to express, have not changed. Did you think I was a young boy who had fallen in love with a pretty <i>contadina? </i>Do you not know how great a place you occupy in my mind...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Tears flooded her eyes. She began breathing rapidly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, <i>caro," </i>she whispered. "You have healed wounds that go... very far back."</p>

  <p class="normal">And she was gone, into a side door of the convent, leaving him on the stone bench which suddenly was cold beneath him, in a garden cold about him.</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Antonio da Sangallo began pouring his foundations for the ring of chapels on the south side of the tribune of St. Peter's, the long-smoldering feud between them became full-blown. According to Michelangelo's measurements, the corresponding wing to the north, toward the Papal palace, would of necessity replace the Pauline chapel and part of the Sistine.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I simply cannot believe my eyes," cried Pope Paul when Michelangelo drew him a plan of what was going on. "Why would Sangallo want to tear down a chapel he designed and built himself?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"His plans for St. Peter's keep expanding."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How much of the Sistine would his chapels replace?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Approximately the area covered by the Deluge, the Drunkenness of Noah, the Delphic Sibyl and Zacharias. God would survive."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How fortunate for Him," murmured Paul.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope suspended work on St. Peter's on the grounds that there was insufficient money to continue. But Sangallo knew that Michelangelo was the cause. Sangallo did not attack directly. He entrusted this to his assistant, Nanni di Baccio Bigio, with a long tradition of hostility to Michelangelo absorbed from his father, who had been excluded from the architectural work on the abortive façade of San Lorenzo, and from his long-time Florentine friend, Baccio Bandinelli, Michelangelo's most vocal opponent in Tuscany. Baccio Bigio, who aspired to succeed Sangallo as the architect of St. Peter's, had an inexhaustible set of vocal cords which he now employed in a retaliatory attack on the Last Judgment as giving comfort to the enemies of the Church and causing converts to Luther. Sangallo and Bigio succeeded in getting a statement issued through Cardinal Caraffa that all works of art, like all books, must first be approved by his committee.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet travelers coming into the Sistine fell on their knees before the fresco, even as Paul III had, repenting of their sins; such a dissolute poet as Molza of Modena underwent conversion. Michelangelo grumbled to Tommaso:</p>

  <p class="normal">"When it comes to me, there is no middle ground. I am either the master or the monster of the world. The Sangallo crowd have formed an image of me out of the stuff of which their own hearts are made."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Mice," replied Tommaso reassuringly, "trying to undermine the Great Wall of China."</p>

  <p class="normal">"More like flies," retorted Michelangelo; "they bite deep enough to draw blood."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have blood to spare."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bindo Altoviti, who had served on the last Florentine Council and was a leader of the exiles in Rome, chose this moment to declare at court that Michelangelo's defense walls of San Miniato had been "a work of art." Pope Paul sent for Michelangelo to join a conference on the defenses of the Vatican with the already appointed commission. His son Pier Luigi was president, Antonio da Sangallo architect; it included Alessandro Vitelli, an officer experienced in warfare, and Montemellino, an artillery officer and engineer.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo glared. Michelangelo kissed the Pope's ring, was introduced to the others. The Pope pointed to Sangallo's model, said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, we seek your opinion. We have a serious problem here, since our defenses proved so inadequate against Charles V."</p>

  <p class="normal">A week later, having studied the terrain, Michelangelo was back in the Pope's study. The commission assembled to hear his verdict.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I have spent the days analyzing approaches to the Vatican. My opinion is that Sangallo's walls could not be defended."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why can't they be defended?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because they are drawn to protect too large an area. Some of your positions in the hills behind us, and the walls going to Trastevere along the Tiber, could be breached."</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I remind you," replied Sangallo, coldly sarcastic, "that people call you a painter and sculptor?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My bastions in Florence were never breached."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They were never attacked."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Emperor's armies respected them too much to attack."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And on the basis of one small wall at San Miniato you are an expert who will replace my fortifications!" shouted Sangallo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That will do," said Pope Paul sternly. "The meeting is adjourned."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo left behind him his criticism of Sangallo's plan, along with detailed drawings to show what alterations should be made to give the Leonine City, or Vatican area, adequate protection. Pier Luigi Farnese and Montemellino agreed with the analysis. The Pope permitted a few of Sangallo's curtain walls to the river to be completed, as well as his lovely Doric gateway. The rest of the work was suspended. Michelangelo was appointed consulting architect to the defense commission, not to succeed Sangallo but to work alongside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next foray came when Sangallo submitted his design for the third-floor windows and cornice of the Farnese palace which he had been building in sections over a long period of years for Cardinal Farnese before he became Pope Paul. Michelangelo had frequently seen the palace under construction, for it faced a piazza just a block from Leo Baglioni's house. He had thought the design ponderous, belonging to the fortresslike bastions of another age, with stubborn strength in its solid stone bulk but without the soaring beauty that such a formidable pile required to give it wings. Now Pope Paul asked Michelangelo to write him a candid criticism of the palace. Michelangelo marked a chapter in Vitruvius' book on architecture, sent it to the Vatican with Urbino, then wrote several blistering pages to prove that the Farnese palace had "no order of any kind; for order is a quaint suitability of the elements of the work separately and universally placed, coherently arranged." Neither did it have disposition, elegance, style, convenience, harmony, propriety or "a comfortable apportionment of places."</p>

  <p class="normal">If designed brilliantly, he concluded, this top row of windows and cornice could be its saving grace.</p>

  <p class="normal">As a result of his letter the Pope threw open to competition the design of the top floor and the decorative cornice. A number of artists, Giorgio Vasari, Pierino del Vaga, Sebastiano del Piombo and Jacopo Meleghino, announced that they were setting to work. And so did Michelangelo Buonarroti.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is beneath you to compete against the kind of artist one finds without a lantern in the market places of the world," protested Tommaso. "Suppose you were to lose? The humiliation would be a blow to your prestige."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I won't lose, Tommaso."</p>

  <p class="normal">His cornice was sculpture, carved and brilliantly decorated. The arches and slender columns of the windows gave the palace the elegance it needed to carry its ponderous body of stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul studied the designs side by side on his breakfast table in the presence of Sangallo, Vasari, Sebastiano, Del Vaga. He looked up and announced:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wish to praise all of these drawings as ingenious and very beautiful. But surely you would agree that it is most true of the divine Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had saved the Farnese palace from mediocrity and dullness, but gossip had it that he had done it to replace Sangallo as architect of St. Peter's; that now all he had to do was to walk into Pope Paul's throne room and announce that he wanted to take over the fabric.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall do nothing of the sort," Michelangelo told Cardinal Niccolò at the Medici palace, when he had ridden there of a Sunday afternoon on his white Arabian stallion.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Caraffa's Commission for the Inquisition began rewriting the classics and preventing new books from being printed. Michelangelo was astonished to find his poetry being regarded as serious literature, his sonnets on Dante, Beauty, Love, Sculpture, Art and the Artist being copied and passed from hand to hand. Some of his madrigals were set to music. Reports reached him of lectures being given about his poetry in the Plato Academy of Florence, and by the professors at the universities in Bologna, Pisa and Padua.</p>

  <p class="normal">Urbino assembled the single-wall tomb of Pope Julius in San Pietro in Vincoli. He placed the Leah and Rachel in the lower niches, the Virgin, Prophet and Sibyl of Raffaello da Montelupo in the wall above. Michelangelo considered the monument a failure; but the Moses sitting in the central bay of the marble wall dominated the church with a power equaled only by that of God in the Genesis and Christ in the Last Judgment.</p>

  <p class="normal">He set up an architectural office in a spare room of the house and put Tommaso de' Cavalieri in charge of the working drawings for the Farnese palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">He completed the Conversion of St. Paul, Christ leaning downward from the sky, cleaving the heavens, with a multitude of wingless angels on either side of him. Paul, fallen from his horse, was dazed and terrified by the revelation, some of his company trying to raise him up, others fleeing in panic. The strong figure of the horse divided the two groups of travelers and soldiers on the ground, as Christ divided the angels above.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had Urbino lay a fresh coat of intonaco for the Crucifixion of Peter. While it was drying he closed out the world, massing for the Descent, a Christ supported on one side by the Virgin, on the other by Mary Magdalene, and behind a portrait of himself as Nicodemus, who had helped take Christ down from the cross.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reputations in Rome were made and broken in the time it took a man to crack a walnut. When Michelangelo refused to take advantage of his victory to force Sangallo out of St. Peter's, the city forgave him for criticizing the Farnese palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then a letter arrived from Aretino, sent from Venice. Though he had never laid eyes on the man, Michelangelo had received a dozen letters from him during the past years, in which Aretino had coupled obsequious flattery with threats of destruction if Michelangelo continued to deny him a gift of drawings. He was about to throw this new epistle unopened into the fire when something wild in the way Aretino had splashed his name across its face arrested his attention. He broke the seal.</p>

  <p class="normal">The letter began with an attack on the Last Judgment. It was too bad Michelangelo had not taken Aretino's advice to represent the world and paradise and hell with the glory, honor and terror sketched in his earlier letters. Instead "You, who are a Christian, you so subordinate belief to art that you have made the violation of modesty among martyrs and virgins into a spectacle, such as we should only venture to contemplate with half-averted eyes in houses of evil repute."</p>

  <p class="normal">From there he went on to call Michelangelo "avaricious" for agreeing to build a tomb for an unworthy Pope, and then a fraud and a thief for having taken "the heaps of gold which Pope Julius bequeathed you," and given the Roveres nothing in return. "That is robbery!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Repulsed but fascinated by the violent ranting and alternate begging tone of the long letter, Michelangelo then read: "It would certainly have been well if you had fulfilled your promise with due care, had it been only to silence the evil tongues who assert that only a Gherardo or a Tommaso knows how to allure favors from you!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was swept by a cold chill. What evil tongues? What favors? Drawings were his to give where he liked. They had not been "allured" from him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He dropped the sheets from Aretino's pen, began to feel ill. In his seventy years he had been accused of many things, of being cantankerous, arrogant, unsociable, snobbishly unwilling to associate with any but those who had the greatest talent, intellect, excellence. But never had such an insinuation been made as this one. Gherardo was a former Florentine friend to whom he had given a few black chalk drawings more than twenty years ago. Tommaso de' Cavaliere was as noble a soul, as finely intelligent and well bred a person as there was in Italy! It was unbelievable. For fifty-odd years, since Argiento had come to him, he had taken apprentices, assistants and servants into his home; there had been at least thirty young men who had lived and worked with him, grown up with him in this traditional relationship. Never in his association with young art apprentices, starting with Ghirlandaio's <i>bottega, </i>had there been a word breathed against the propriety of his conduct. What a target for blackmail he would have been had he ever put himself at anyone's mercy!</p>

  <p class="normal">The charge of blasphemy in his concept of the Last Judgment, the accusation that he had defrauded the Rovere family, could be simply fought. But to be confronted at this time of his life with this false imputation, a charge not unlike the one for which Leonardo da Vinci had been publicly prosecuted in Florence so long ago, seemed to him as devastating a blow as he had received in all his stormy years.</p>

  <p class="normal">It did not take long for Aretino's poison to seep into Rome. A few days later Tommaso arrived with his face pale, his lips compressed. When Michelangelo insisted on knowing what was wrong he brushed the fingers of his right hand across the palm of his left, as though to rid his hands of offal.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I heard last night," he said, more in sadness than anger, "from a bishop at court about Aretino's letter."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo slumped into a chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How does one deal with such a creature?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p class="normal">"One doesn't. One accedes to his demands. That's how he has prospered in the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm sorry, Tommaso. I never meant to cause you embarrassment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is you I am worried about, Michelangelo, not myself. My family and companions know me well; they will scoff at this canard and ignore it... But you, my dear friend, are revered all over Europe. It is you that Aretino means to hurt, your work and position.... The last thing in the world I want is to hurt you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You could never hurt me, Tomao. Your love and admiration fed me. With Marchesa Victoria ill, it is the only love I can count on to sustain me. I also will ignore Aretino. As one should all blackmailers. If he can destroy our friendship he will already have achieved some part of his purpose of inflicting injury on me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Rome's tongue would rather wag over a fresh scandal than a <i>scaloppina," </i>warned Tommaso.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let us continue with our lives and our work. That is the proper answer to scandalmongers."</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">In his drawings for the Crucifixion of St. Peter he struck out boldly to find a new expression for painting. In the center of the design he pictured a hole being dug to hold the heavy cross. Peter was nailed to it, upside down, while it lay angled across a giant boulder. Unharmed as yet by his impaling, Peter glared out at the world, his elderly bearded face fiercely eloquent in its condemnation not merely of the soldiers about him who were directing the crucifixion, or of the laborers who were helping to raise the cross upward, but of the entire world beyond: an indictment of tyranny and cruelty as piercing as that of the Last Judgment.</p>

  <p class="normal">As be was completing the sketch of the two Roman centurions and wishing he could draw their horses with the genius that Leonardo da Vinci had had with them, church bells started tolling mournfully over the city. His servant woman burst into the studio, crying:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Messere, </span></i><span>Sangallo is dead!"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"...dead? He has been building in Terni...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He caught the malaria. They just brought his body back."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul gave Antonio da Sangallo a spectacular funeral. His coffin was carried through the streets with great pomp, followed by the artists and craftsmen who had worked with him over the years. In church, Michelangelo stood with Tommaso and Urbino listening to the eulogizing of Sangallo as one of the greatest architects since the ancients who had built Rome. Walking home, Michelangelo commented:</p>

  <p class="normal">"That eulogy is word for word the one I heard for Bramante; yet Pope Leo had stopped all of Bramante's work, just as Pope Paul had halted Sangallo's on the Farnese palace, the defense walls... St. Peter's..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso stopped in his tracks, turned to look sharply at Michelangelo. "Do you think...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Oh no, Tommaso!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The superintendent of the fabric suggested that Giulio Romano, sculptor and architect, disciple of Raphael, be called from Mantua and appointed architect of St. Peter's. Pope Paul cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It shall be Michelangelo Buonarroti. None else!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was summoned by a groom, rode his stallion to the Vatican. The Pope was surrounded by a contingent of his cardinals and courtiers.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My son, I am herewith appointing you architect of St. Peter's."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I cannot assume the post."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a twinkle in Paul's fading but still shrewdly discerning eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you going to tell me that architecture is not your trade?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flushed. He had forgotten that Pope Paul, then the Cardinal Farnese, had been in this same throne room when Julius commissioned him to decorate the Sistine vault, and he had cried in anguish, "It is not my trade."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I might have to tear down everything Sangallo has built, dismiss Sangallo's contractors. Rome would be solidly against me. I have the Crucifixion of St. Peter to complete. I am over seventy years old! Where will I find the vital force to build from the ground up the mightiest church in Christendom?... I am not Abraham, Holy Father, who lived one hundred and seventy-five years...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul was singularly unaffected by Michelangelo's tale of woe. His eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My son, you are but a youth. When you reach my august age of seventy-eight you will be allowed to speak of your years. Not before! By that time you will have St. Peter's well on its way."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's smile was on the wan side.</p>

  <p class="normal">He left the Vatican grounds by the Belvedere gate, made the long climb to the top of Monte Mario, and after resting and watching the sunset, descended the opposite side of St. Peter's. The workmen had gone home. He went over Sangallo's foundations, the lower walls for the ring of chapels extending to the south. The numerous and heavy piers, on which Sangallo had meant to build a nave and two aisles, would have to be leveled. The huge cement bases for the two steeples, or bell towers, would have to go, as would the supports being built for the heavy dome.</p>

  <p class="normal">His tour of inspection ended just as night closed down. Finding himself in front of the chapel of Mary of the Fever, he went in and stood in the dark before his Pietà. He was torn by inner conflict. Every move he had made since he had first denounced Bramante's cement mix to Pope Julius had pushed him toward the inevitability of his taking over this task. He truly wanted to rescue St. Peter's, make it a glorious monument to Christianity. He had always felt that it was his church; that if not for him, it might never have been conceived. Then was he not responsible for it?</p>

  <p class="normal">He also knew the dimension of the task, the depth of the opposition he would meet, the years of grueling labor. The end of his life would be harder driven than any portion that had gone before.</p>

  <p class="normal">An old woman came into the chapel, placed a lighted taper before the Madonna. Michelangelo reached into the long basket of candles, selected one, lighted it, placed it beside the other.</p>

  <p class="normal">Of course he must build St. Peter's! Was not life to be worked, and suffered, right to the end?</p>

  <p class="normal">He refused to accept any pay for his services as architect, even when Pope Paul sent his Keeper of the Wardrobe to the Macello dei Corvi with a packet of one hundred ducats. He painted from first light until dinnertime in the Pauline chapel, then walked the few steps to St. Peter's to watch the leveling. The workmen were sullen and ill disposed toward him... but they followed the schedule he set. To his dismay he found that Bramante's four major piers, which had been repaired over a period of years by Raphael, Peruzzi and Sangallo, were still defective and would not support the tribune and dome until more tons of concrete were poured into them. The disclosure of this still evident weakness further infuriated the superintendent of the fabric and the contractors who had worked under Sangallo. They put so many obstacles in his path that Pope Paul had to issue a decree declaring Michelangelo superintendent as well as architect, ordering everyone employed on St. Peter's to follow his orders implicitly. Those contractors and artisans who remained unfriendly, Michelangelo dismissed.</p>

  <p class="normal">From that moment the fabric began to grow with a momentum that startled and then amazed Rome as people came to look at the two spiral ramps he had built on either side of the slope so that both animals, carrying materials, and men on horseback, carrying supplies across their saddles, could climb to the top, speeding up the provisioning process fiftyfold over the workmen walking up and down with materials on their backs.</p>

  <p class="normal">A committee of Roman Conservators, impressed, came to ask if he would rescue the Capitoline hill and downslope called the Campidoglio, which had been the seat of religion and government of the Roman Empire, with its Temples of Jupiter and of Juno Moneta. This glorious spot, just above his own house, where he had sat with Contessina to watch Pope Leo declare Giuliano de' Medici a Baron of Rome, was a shambles, the old temples, reduced to piles of stone, the Senate building an archaic fortress, animals feeding off the site, the level area a sea of mud in winter and of dust in summer. Would Michelangelo undertake to restore the Campidoglio to its former grandeur?</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would I?" cried Michelangelo to Tommaso, when the Conservators had left him to consider their offer. "If only Giuliano da Sangallo could know! This was his dream. You shall help me, Tomao. We can make your hope of rebuilding Rome come true."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso's eyes were dancing like stars on a windy night.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thanks to your training, I can do the job. You will see that I shall become a good architect."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We will plan big, Tomao, set up work for the next fifty years. When I am gone, you will complete everything according to our plans."</p>

  <p class="normal">Now that he was working as a full-fledged architect, he appointed Tommaso as his assistant, assigning additional architectural work space in the house. Tommaso, a meticulous draftsman, was rapidly developing into one of the ablest of the city's young architects.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria Colonna's brother Ascanio had become involved in a quarrel with the Pope over the salt tax, and his private army attacked by the papal forces. Ascanio had been driven out of Rome, all of the Colonna family properties confiscated. Cardinal Caraffa's antagonism to Vittoria was heightened. Several of her former associates fled to Germany and joined the Lutherans... which further convicted her in the eyes of the Committee of Inquisition. She now took refuge in the convent of Sant'Anna de' Funari, buried deep within the gardens and colonnades of the ancient Theater of Pompey. When Michelangelo visited her of a Sunday afternoon, she sometimes did not utter a word. He brought sketches with him, trying to interest her in the works he had projected, but she came alive only when she told him of the special permission she had received to visit the Sistine Chapel and stand before the Last Judgment, and when he spoke of the dome for St. Peter's, still vague and illusive in his mind. She knew of his abiding love for the Pantheon, and the Duomo of Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because they are pure sculpture," he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And what of St. Peter's dome? Will that be only a top to keep out the rain?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vittoria, it is good to see you smile, and to hear you tease me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must not think me unhappy, Michelangelo. I await with trembling joy my reunion with God."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Cara, 1 </span></i><span>should be angry with you. Why are you so eager to die, when there are those of us who love you dearly? Is it not selfish of you?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">She took his hand between hers. In the early flood of his love this would have been a portentous moment; now he could only feel how sharp her bones were beneath the skin. Her eyes burned as she whispered:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Forgive me for failing you. I can forgive myself only because I know you have no real need of me. A new Descent from the Cross in marble, a regal staircase for the Campidoglio, a dome for St. Peter's: these are your loves. You created majestically before you met me, and you will create majestically after I am gone."</p>

  <p class="normal">Before there was time for another Sunday meeting he was summoned to the Cesarini palace, home of a Colonna cousin who had married a Cesarini. He crossed beyond the Torre Argentina, was met at a gate and led into a garden.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The marchesa?" he asked of the doctor who came out to greet him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She will not see the sunrise."</p>

  <p class="normal">He paced the garden while the heavens moved in their cycle. At the seventeenth hour he was admitted to the palace. Vittoria lay on her pillow, her faded copper hair enclosed in a silk hood, dressed in a shirt of finest linen, with a lace collar fastened at the throat. She looked as young and beautiful as the first time he had met her. Her expression was one of sublimity, as though she had already gone beyond all earthly troubles.</p>

  <p class="normal">Speaking in a low voice, Donna Filippa, Abbess of Sant'Anna de' Funari, ordered in the coffin. It was coated with tar. Michelangelo cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is the meaning of this tar-covered coffin? The marchesa has not died of an infectious disease."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We fear reprisals, <i>signore," </i>the abbess murmured. "We must get the marchesa back to the convent and buried before her enemies can claim the body."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo longed to lean over and kiss Vittoria on the brow. He was restrained by the knowledge that she had never offered him anything but her hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned home, aching in every joint of his body and cranny of his skull. He sat down at his workbench to write:</p>

  <p class="versi">If being near the fire I burned with it,</p>

  <p class="versi">Now that its flame is quenched and doth not show,</p>

  <p class="versi">What wonder if I waste within and glow,</p>

  <p class="versi">Dwindling away to cinders bit by bit?</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria in her will had directed the abbess to select her grave. Cardinal Caraffa forbade burial. For almost three weeks the coffin was left unattended in a corner of the convent chapel. Michelangelo was at last informed that she had been buried in the chapel wall, but when he went to the church he could find no sign of the immurement. The abbess looked about cautiously, then answered to his question:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The marchesa was removed to Naples. She will lie next to her husband, in San Domenico Maggiore."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo trudged wearily homeward, chewing on the bitter herb of irony: the marchese, who had fled his wife during his married life, would now have her by his side for all eternity. And he, Michelangelo, who had found in Vittoria the crowning love of his life, had never been permitted to fulfill it.</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did not lack for projects. In the eyes of the world he was truly the "Master." He was assigned yet another task by Pope Paul, who asked him to undertake the design and building of the defense works which would give him greater security within the Leonine City, and to engineer the erection of the obelisk of Caligula in the Piazza San Pietro. Duke Cosimo urged him to return to Florence to create sculptures for the city. The King of France deposited money in a Roman bank in his name against the day when he would carve or paint for him. The Sultan of Turkey offered to send an escort party to bring him to Constantinople to work there. Wherever an art commission was to be granted, in Portugal a Madonna della Misericordia for the king, in Milan a tomb for one of the distant Medici, in Florence for the ducal palace, Michelangelo was consulted about the theme, design, the proper artists for the job.</p>

  <p class="normal">He spent the better part of the daily hours in the Pauline, painting the amazed and terror-stricken faces of the women who were watching Peter on the cross, then the portrait of the elderly bearded soldier, grief-stricken over his part in the execution. Tiring of paintbrushes, he returned home to pick up hammer and chisel, glorying in the sheer freedom of being able to carve to satisfy his inner needs. Only marble carving gave him a sense of his own three-dimensional fullness. He had been unhappy about the Leah and Rachel, ashamed of presenting second-rate work to the world; he had been afraid that he had grown too old for the vigorous art of marble sculpture. But now his chisel sang through the shining stone in a continuous "Go!", creating the collapsed Christ and behind him Nicodemus with his own white beard, deep-sunk eyes, flattened nose, a cowl over his head, the mouth sensitive, poetic.</p>

  <p class="normal">He allowed no one in the Pauline chapel while he painted, but his studio was thronged with artists from all over Europe whom he employed, encouraged, taught and found commissions for.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, after weeks and months of lavishly outpoured energy, he would suddenly fall ill, with what he could not tell: a pulling in his thighs, a piercing pain in the groin, a weakness in the chest that kept him from breathing, a kidney ailment. At such times he would feel his brain shrink, he would grow cranky, fractious with his closest friends and relatives, accuse his nephew Lionardo of making a trip to Rome during his illness to make sure he would inherit all the properties, and his manager of selling copies of an engraving to make money for himself. Realdo Colombo, Italy's greatest anatomist, who was writing the first book on the subject, spent his spare hours in the Macello dei Corvi, flushing Michelangelo with spring water from Fiuggi. He would recover, his brain seem to expand, and he would cry to Tommaso:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why do I behave so cantankerously? Because my seventies are fleeing so fast?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Granacci said you were already crusty at twelve, when he first met you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So he did. Bless his memory."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci, his oldest friend, had died; so had Balducci, Leo Baglioni and Sebastiano del Piombo. With each passing month he seemed closer to the vortex of the birth and death cycle. A letter from Lionardo brought him the news that his brother Giovansimone had died and been buried in Santa Croce. He reproached his nephew for not sending the details of Giovansimone's illness. He also broached the subject of his nephew's marriage, suggesting that since Lionardo was approaching thirty it was time he sought a wife, and had sons to carry on the Buonarroti name:</p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">I believe in Florence there are many noble but poor families with whom it would be a charity to form a union, and it would be well there should be no dowry for there would then be no pride. You need a wife to associate with, and whom you can rule, and who will not care about pomps and run about every day to parties and marriages. It is easy for a woman to go wrong who does these things.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">Nor is it to be said by anyone that you wish to ennoble yourself by marriage, for it is well known we are as ancient and noble citizens of Florence as any other house.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso de' Cavalieri was married. Tommaso had waited until he was thirty-eight, then proposed to the young daughter of a noble Roman family. They were married in a sumptuous wedding, attended by the Pope and his court, the entire roster of Roman nobility, the Florentine colony, the artists of Rome. Within the year Signora Cavalieri presented her husband with his first son.</p>

  <p class="normal">The birth was quickly followed by a death: that of Pope Paul, grieving over the incorrigibility of his grandson, Ottavio, and the murder of his son, Pier Luigi, whom he had foisted on the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. In contrast to Clement's funeral, the people of the city showed genuine grief over the loss of Paul.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the College of Cardinals met there was expectant joy in the hearts of the Florentine colony, for they believed it was the turn of Cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi, Contessina's son, to become Pope. He had no enemies in Italy except the small group sharing power with Duke Cosimo of Florence. However, Niccolò had a powerful enemy outside of Italy: Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. During the conclave in the Sistine Chapel, with the election all but settled in favor of Niccolò, he became suddenly and violently ill. By morning he was dead. Dr. Realdo Colombo performed an autopsy. At its completion he came to the house on the Macello dei Corvi. Michelangelo looked up with dazed eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Murder?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Beyond any doubt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You found proof?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"If I myself had administered the poison I could not be more sure of the cause of Niccolò's death. Lottini, Duke Cosimo's agent, could have had the opportunity."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo lowered his head, stricken.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Once again it is the end of our hopes for Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">As always, when he was made desolate by the events of the outside world, he turned to marble. Now in the Descent, which he was carving in the hopes that his friends would place it on his own tomb after his death, he encountered a strange problem: Christ's left leg was hampering the design. After careful consideration he cut the leg off in its entirety. Christ's hand, extending downward and clasped in the Madonna's, adroitly hid the fact that there was only one leg left.</p>

  <p class="normal">The College of Cardinals elected sixty-two-year-old Giovan Maria de' Gocchi del Monte, who became Pope Julius III. Michelangelo had known him at court for countless years; he had helped to rewrite the contract for Julius' tomb several times. Three times during the siege of 1527 Cardinal Ciocchi del Monte had been seized by the Emperor's army and taken to the gallows in front of Leo Baglioni's house in the Campo dei Fiori; three times he had been reprieved at the last moment. His main interest in life was pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He should have taken the name Leo XI," Michelangelo confided to Tommaso. "He will probably paraphrase Leo's statement by saying, 'Since God saved me three times from the gallows just to make me Pope, let me enjoy it.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He will be good for artists," Tommaso replied. "He likes their company best. He plans to enlarge his small villa near the Porta del Popolo into a sumptuous palace."</p>

  <p class="normal">Very quickly Michelangelo was summoned to dinner at the Villa di Papa Giulio, already filling up with ancient statues, columns, paintings; and with artists in all media, most of whom already had commissions, including Michelangelo's friends Giorgio Vasari, the new architect for the villa, and Cecchino Rossi, who, with Vasari, had saved the David's arm; Guglielmo della Porta, successor to Sebastiano, Annibale Caracci. As yet the new Pope had not discussed the continuation of St. Peter's. Michelangelo waited anxiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius III had a long nose that drooped downward, about the only feature to emerge from a matted gray beard. He was a prodigious eater, stuffing large quantities of food into an opening in the beard which seemed to entrap it. Suddenly the Pope called for silence. The diners became still.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo," he cried in his rough, hearty voice, "I have not asked you to work for me out of respect for your age."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is a mere twelve years' difference, Holiness," replied Michelangelo with mock humility. "Since we all know how hard you are going to strive to make your pontificate outstanding, I do not think I dare claim exemption on that score."</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius enjoyed the sarcasm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are so valuable to us, dear Master, that I would gladly give years off my life if they could be added to yours."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo watched the Pope dispatch a plate of richly stuffed goose, thought, "We Tuscans are lean eaters, that is why we live so long."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aloud, he said, "I appreciate your offer, but in all fairness to the Christian world I cannot let you make the sacrifice."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then, my son, if I survive you, as is probable in the natural course of life, I shall have your body embalmed, and keep it near me, so that it shall be as lasting as your work."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's appetite vanished. He wondered if there were some way to be excused. But Julius was not through with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are a few things I would like you to design for me: a new staircase and fountain for the Belvedere, a façade for a palace at San Rocco, monuments for my uncle and grandfather...."</p>

  <p class="normal">But no word of St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope gathered his company in the vineyard for music and plays. Michelangelo slipped away. All he wanted from Julius was to be confirmed as architect of St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope procrastinated. Michelangelo kept his designs and plans secret, providing the contractors only with those specifications for the next segment of the job. He had always had this need for privacy with work in progress. Now he had a valid reason for working in secrecy; but it got him into trouble.</p>

  <p class="normal">A group of the ousted contractors, led by the persuasive Baccio Bigio, interested Cardinal Cervini, in charge of the bookkeeping for the fabric, in their claims. A written document was presented to the Pope. Michelangelo was summoned to the Villa di Papa Giulio.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You an not afraid to face your critics?" asked Julius.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Holiness, but I want the meeting to take place inside the fabric itself."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a large crowd that assembled in what was to become the new chapel of the Kings of France. Baccio Bigio opened the attack by exclaiming:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti has pulled down a more beautiful church than he is capable of building."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let us proceed to your criticism of the present structure," replied the Pope amiably.</p>

  <p class="normal">An official cried, "Holy Father, immense sums are being spent without our being told why. Nor has anything been communicated to us of the manner in which the building is to be carried on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is the responsibility of the architect," replied Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But, Holiness, Buonarroti treats us as if the matter did not concern us at all. We are completely useless!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope repressed a half-formed quip. Cardinal Cervini threw his arms upward to indicate the arches that were being built.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, as you can see, Buonarroti is building three chapels at each end of these transverse arches. It is our opinion that this arrangement, particularly in the southern apse, will permit too little light to reach the interior..."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope's eyes peered over the edge of the matted beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm inclined to agree with the criticism, Michelangelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned to Cervini, replied quietly, "Monsignor, above those windows in the travertine vaulting there are to be three other windows."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You never gave a hint of that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nor was I bound to do so."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have a right to know what you are doing." Cardinal Cervini was now furious. "You are not infallible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will never bind myself to give Your Lordship, or anyone else, information of my intentions. Your office is to furnish money and take care that it is not stolen. The building plan concerns me alone."</p>

  <p class="normal">A bruised silence adumbrated through the vast construction, its walls, piers, arches reaching to the open sky. Michelangelo turned back to the Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, you can see with your own eyes how much excellent building I am getting for the money. If all this work does not tend to the saving of my soul, since I have refused to accept any pay, I shall have expended considerable time and trouble in vain."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope placed his hand on Michelangelo's shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Neither your eternal nor your temporal welfare shall suffer. You are the supreme architect of St. Peter's." Turning to the ring of accusers, he said sternly, "And so shall he remain, as long as I am Pope!"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a victory for Michelangelo. In the process he had incurred a new enemy, Cardinal Marcello Cervini.</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">To placate Baccio Bigio, Pope Paul took away from Michelangelo the reconstruction job he had started on the Ponte Santa Maria. Bigio removed the ancient travertine supports to lighten the bridge, finished it with cement and pebbles. Michelangelo, riding over the bridge on horseback with Vasari, said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Giorgio, this bridge is shaking under us. Let us spur our horses or it may fall while we are on it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vasari spread the quip around Rome. Bigio was livid with rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What does Buonarroti know about bridges?"</p>

  <p class="normal">At the beginning of 1551 Julius III finally issued his <i>breve </i>making Michelangelo official architect of St. Peter's'; but in a few months he had to shut down all work on the fabric. Julius was pouring such a vast fortune into the Villa di Papa Giulio and entertaining himself on such a lavish scale that he used up the income stipulated for St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was now Michelangelo's turn to be livid. He demanded of Tommaso, as they hunched over their drawing boards:</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can I go to Julius and cry, 'Holiness, your insatiable appetite for pleasure is bankrupting us. Restrain yourself so that we can complete St. Peter's'?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He would have you thrown into a dungeon of Sant'Angelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then I will keep silent, painful as it may be."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was still agitated when he began to carve on the Descent later in the day. He struck emery in Christ's forearm. The sparks flew under his chisel. Angrily he struck the forearm a series of harsh blows... only to have it shatter and fall to the floor. He put down his hammer and chisel and left the house.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked past the stalls of Trajan's market like black holes in a cliff as they climbed the hill, toward the Temple of Mars. Unhappy about smashing the arm, he decided to start all over again. This time on an Entombment. He entered a stoneyard just beyond Caesar's forum, came across an ancient block that had been part of a cornice, a marble-colored limestone from the Palestrina area. Despite the fact that the stone had deep hollows he had it sent to the studio, began searching his mind for a concept. In his new version there would be no Nicodemus; Christ would be a giant head and arms and torso with foreshortened legs falling away, crushed under their burden, only Mary's head and hands visible as she tried desperately to hold up the weight of her massively dead son.</p>

  <p class="normal">Relaxed and refreshed, he returned to the Macello dei Corvi. Urbino was waiting for him with a worried expression.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Messere, </span></i><span>I do not like to bring you further problems, but I must now leave you."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was too astonished to answer.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leave me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You remember the girl I chose, in Urbino, ten years ago?..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo shook his head in disbelief. Was it already ten years?</p>

  <p class="normal">"She is eighteen today. It is time for us to marry."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But why go? Bring your wife here, Urbino, we'll fix up an apartment for you, buy furniture. Your wife can have her own maid..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Urbino's eyes were round as Giotto's O.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you sure, <i>messere? </i>For I am forty now, and I should have children as quickly as possible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is your home. I am your family. Your sons will be my grandsons."</p>

  <p class="normal">He gave Urbino two thousand ducats in cash so that he could be independent, then an additional sum to fix up a room for his bride and to buy a new bed. In a few days Urbino returned with his wife, Cornelia Colonelli, a sympathetic girl who took over the management of the household and ran it well. She gave Michelangelo the affection she would have brought to her husband's father. Nine months later they named their first son Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">He urged his nephew in Florence to "purchase a handsome house in town, to cost from fifteen hundred to two thousand ducats, in our quarter. As soon as you have found it, I shall forward the money." Once Lionardo had settled in a proper house, he was to find a wife, and go about the serious business of having sons.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lionardo chose Cassandra Ridolfi, a distant member of the family into which Contessina had married. Michelangelo was so delighted that he sent Cassandra two rings, one diamond and the other ruby. Cassandra sent Michelangelo eight lovely shirts as a return gift. They named their first-born son Buonarroto, after Leonardo's father. The next son they named Michelangelo, but he died very quickly, and Michelangelo grieved.</p>

  <p class="normal">To re-create the Campidoglio he took the ancient Roman stone salt tax office, which a few hundred years before had been turned into a bastionlike Senatorial building, and converted it into a regal official palace with lyrical flights of steps rising from either end to a center entrance. He then planned two palaces, identical in design, for either side of the square which for centuries had been a market. He leveled the piazza, paved it with patterned stones, searched his mind for a flawless work of art for the middle of the square. He thought of the Laocoön, the Belvedere torso, the gigantic stone head of Augustus. None of these seemed right. Then he remembered the bronze equestrian statue of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius which had stood unharmed in front of St. John in Lateran all through the centuries because the Christians had believed it to be Constantino, the first Christian emperor. He placed it on such a low platform that the gloriously lifelike statue would appear to be on eye level with the people coming in and out of the palaces on either side; Marcus Aurelius seemed to have just come down the Senatorial steps and mounted his horse to ride across Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">In March 1555, Tommaso, Vasari, Raffaelo da Montelupo, Ammanati and Daniele da Volterra gave him a party for his eightieth birthday. The walls of the studio were lined with drawings and projects for another eighty years ahead....</p>

  <p class="normal">Two weeks later Pope Julius III died, unable to spare any years off his life for his friend Michelangelo. To Michelangelo's consternation, Cardinal Marcello Cervini, erstwhile accountant for the fabric, was elected Pope. He took the title of Marcellus II.</p>

  <p class="normal">And that, reasoned Michelangelo quite calmly, was the end for him. He had told Cardinal Cervini that the plan of St. Peter's was none of his business. As Pope, it would now be very much his business!</p>

  <p class="normal">He spent no time in bemoaning his fate. Instead, he began winding up his affairs in Rome, making arrangements to transfer his bank account and marbles to Florence. He was leaving Urbino in the house, since his wife Cornelia was again pregnant. He burned his early drawings for St. Peter's and the dome, was about to pack his saddlebags when, after a three-week reign, Pope Marcellus died.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo went to Church, offered thanks to God for giving him the strength not to rejoice over Cervini's death. After another three weeks he decided that it might have been just as well for him to have returned to Florence: Cardinal Giovanni Pietro Caraffa became Pope Paul IV.</p>

  <p class="normal">No one knew quite how he had been elected. He was a thoroughly disagreeable man, violent of nature, intolerant of all about him. Pope Paul IV, knowing how completely he was hated, said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do not know why they elected me Pope, so I am bound to conclude that it is not the cardinals but God who makes the Popes."</p>

  <p class="normal">Announcing that it was his ambition to wipe out all heresy in Italy, he unleashed on the Roman people the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition. In a fortresslike structure near the Vatican his Board of Inquisition tortured and condemned accused people without trial, locked them in dungeons in the cellars, burned others in the Campo dei Fiori... at the same time the Pope was making a corrupt nephew a cardinal and establishing duchies for others of his relatives. Michelangelo considered he would be fit fuel for the fires burning outside Leo Baglioni's house; but he made no attempt to flee. The Pope did not molest him... until the day of reckoning.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul IV received him in a small, monastic room with whitewashed walls and a minimum of uncomfortable furniture. His expression was as severe as his robe.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, I respect your work. But it is the implicit will of the Council of Trent that heretical frescoes such as your altar wall be destroyed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...the Last Judgment?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood before the Pope's wooden chair feeling as though he were a corpse in the dead room of Santo Spirito and a dissector had just chiseled off his skull, lifted out his brain, and let it slip to the floor. He half slid to the corner of a bench, sat staring blindly at the whitewashed wall before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Many in our hierarchy feel that you have blasphemed; they are confirmed by an article written by Aretino of Venice..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A blackmailer!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...a friend of Titian, of Charles V, Benvenuto Cellini, the late Francis I of France, Jacopo Sansovino.... Here is one of the copies passing from hand to hand in Rome. I'm convinced the Council of Trent has also studied it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo took the paper from the Pope, began to read:</p>

  <p class="versi">Is it possible that you can have represented in the sacred temple of God, above the altar of His Son, in the greatest Chapel in the world, where Cardinals and Bishops and the Vicar of Christ, with Catholic ceremonial and sacred ritual, confess, contemplate and adore the body and blood of Jesus... so lofty a subject, with angels and saints without a remnant of modesty and denuded of all celestial ornament!</p>

  <p class="normal">He jerked his head up abruptly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, this attack was written when I refused to send Arentino some of my drawings and cartoons. It was his way of striking at me..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Decent people are shocked by the nakedness of saints and martyrs, of hundreds of men and women fully exposed..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are the narrow-minded, Holy Father, ignorant of the true nature of art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you call your Holy Father narrow-minded, Michelangelo? And ignorant? For I am one of them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The fresco is not evil. Never has there been a wall more permeated with a love of God."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very well, I will not demand that the wall be torn down. We will simply give it a coat of whitewash. Then you can paint something over it, a theme that will make everyone happy. Something simple and devout, that you can do quickly."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was too crushed to fight back. Not so, Rome. His friends, adherents, his old associates at court, including a number of cardinals led by Ercole Gonzaga, began a campaign to save the wall. Tommaso brought him daily reports of new friends gained: an ambassador from France, a bishop from Venice, a noble Roman family.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then an anonymous intermediary came up with what Rome believed to be a brilliant compromise. Daniele da Volterra, trained in painting under Sodoma and in architecture under Peruzzi, now one of Michelangelo's most enthusiastic followers, came to the studio with high color in his cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Master, the Last Judgment is saved."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't believe it. The Pope has agreed?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...not to destroy it. There will be no coat of whitewash."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo collapsed onto his leather chair, breathing hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I must go out and thank personally every last person who helped me...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Master," interrupted Daniele, with eyes averted, "we have had to pay a price."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What price?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"... well, to mollify the Pope... he agreed not to destroy the wall providing breeches were put on everybody's nakedness."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Breeches? You mean... <i>calzoni?"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"And petticoats on the females. We must cover every erogenous zone. Only a few women may remain bare above the waist All must be clothed from the hips to the knees, particularly those whose bottoms are facing the chapel. His favorite saints must be robed, as well as St. Catherine, the Virgin's skirt made heavier..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If in my earlier years I had given myself to make sulphur matches," swore Michelangelo, "I should now suffer less."</p>

  <p class="normal">Daniele shivered, as though struck.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Master, let us try to be sensible about this. The Pope was going to call in a court painter... but I persuaded him to let me do the job. I will injure the wall as little as possible. If we let some stranger..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"'Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves girdles.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't be angry with me. I am not at the Council of Trent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are right, Daniele. We must offer up these private parts to the Inquisition. I have spent a lifetime portraying the beauty of man. Now he has become shameful again, to be burned in a new bonfire of vanities. Do you know what that means, Daniele? We are returning to the darkest, most ignorant centuries of the past."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Look here, Michelangelo," said Daniele placatingly, "I can blend in gauze, bits of cloth to match your flesh tones. I will use so thin a paint that the next Pope can have all the breeches and robes removed without harming anything beneath..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo shook his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Go then, and wrap their winding sheets about them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Trust me. I shall outwit the Pope at every point. This task is so delicate that it will be months, years before I ever dare begin." Daniele was a hard worker, without originality, and so painstakingly slow that he had earned the reputation of never completing a commission during the patron's lifetime. "Perhaps by that time Caraffa will be dead, the Inquisition over...."</p>

  <p class="normal">The best way to shut out terror was to pick up hammer and chisel and start carving. He had recently bought an irregular column, protruding at top and bottom. Instead of straightening the block, he decided to make use of this odd shape to achieve a crescent profile. He started massing inside the center, wondering if the block could tell him what he wanted to create. The marble remained aloof, unyielding, silent. It was asking too much of raw material, even though it was shining stone, to create a work of art all by itself; but the challenge of the characterful column excited new energy in him.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was just as necessary to survive at eighty as at thirty-five; but a little more difficult.</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sigismondo died in Settignano, the last of his brothers. He had outlived his generation. Equally sad was the illness of Urbino, who had been with him for twenty-six years. The nobility of Urbino's spirit shone forth when he whispered to Michelangelo:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even more than dying, it grieves me to leave you alone in this treacherous world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Urbino's wife, Cornelia, gave birth to her second son at the moment her husband was being buried. Michelangelo kept them with him until Urbino's will was settled. He was named guardian and tutor of the two boys; when their mother left with them for her parents' home in Urbino, the house seemed desolate.</p>

  <p class="normal">He pushed ahead the work of the rising tribune of St. Peter's; he carved his new Pietà; he bought another farm for Lionardo, sent Cornelia Urbino seven spans of a lightweight black cloth she had asked for; began searching for worthy poor whom he could help for the salvation of his soul. Then he had to let the work on St. Peter's grind to a halt once again because of the threatened invasion of the Spanish army.</p>

  <p class="normal">The eighties, he decided, were not the most pleasant decade in the span of man. When he left Florence at sixty he had feared that his life might be over; but love had made him young again, and the sixties had flown by. During his seventies he had been so deeply immersed in the Pauline chapel frescoes, the carving of the Descent, his new architectural career, and St. Peter's, that no day had been long enough to accomplish his tasks.</p>

  <p class="normal">But now, as he became eighty-one, and moved toward eighty-two, the hours were like hornets, each stinging as it passed. He could no longer see as well as he used to; his step was not as firm; stamina was giving way to a series of minor disturbances, sapping his strength, interfering with his drive to finish St. Peter's, to create a glorious dome for it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he went down with a severe attack of kidney stones. Dr. Colombo pulled him through with the aid of Tommaso's untiring care; but he was confined to his bed for several months and was obliged to turn over the designs for one of the chapels to a new superintendent. When he recovered, and laboriously climbed the scaffolding, he found that the new superintendent had misread his plans, making serious errors in construction. He was overcome with shame and remorse; this was his first failure in the ten years of building. And at last he had handed Baccio Bigio a fulcrum on which to rest a new attack: an error of grave proportions which he could neither excuse nor explain away.</p>

  <p class="normal">He called on the Pope at once; but quick as he was, Bigio had been there before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is true?" Pope Paul asked as he saw Michelangelo's face. "The chapel will have to be pulled down?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Most of it, Holiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am saddened. How could such a thing happen?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have been ill, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I see. Bigio claims you are too old to carry such a heavy responsibility. He feels that for your own sake you should be relieved of the crushing burden."</p>

  <p class="normal">"His solicitude touches me. He and his associates have been trying to get this 'crushing burden' off my shoulders and into their own hands for a lot of years now. But didn't Bigio's Ponte Santa Maria just collapse in the flood? Can you believe that Baccio Bigio is better on his good days than I am on my bad?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No one is questioning your ability."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was silent for a moment, thinking backward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, for thirty years I watched good architects pour foundations. They never got St. Peter's off the ground. In the ten years I have been the architect, the church has risen upward like an eagle. If you dismiss me now, it will be the ruin of the edifice."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope's lips twitched.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, as long as you have the strength to fight back, you shall remain the architect of St. Peter's."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night there was a meeting in the house on the Macello dei Corvi. Because he had nearly died, Tommaso, a group of his oldest friends, and the Cardinal of Carpi, who had become his protector at court, insisted that he build a complete model of the dome. Up to now he had made only fragmentary sketches.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If we had lost you last week," said Tommaso flatly, "how would anyone have known what kind of dome you envisaged?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have heard you say," added the cardinal, "that you wanted to progress the fabric so far that no one could change its design after your death."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is my hope."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then give us the dome!" cried Lottino, an artist disciple. "There is no other way."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are right," replied Michelangelo with a sigh. "But I have not yet conceived the final dome. I shall have to find it. Then we shall build a wooden model."</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone left except Tommaso. Michelangelo walked to his drawing table, pulled up a wooden chair. He mused aloud, as his pen roamed over a fresh sheet of paper. The Pantheon and the Duomo in Florence had two domes, one inside the other, interlaced structurally to give each other support. The interior of his dome would be sculpture, the exterior architecture....</p>

  <p class="normal">A dome was not a mere covering; any roof would serve that utilitarian purpose. A dome was a major work of art, the perfect blending of sculpture and architecture in displacing space and adding to the firmament. It was a vault of man, created in the image of the vault of heaven. The perfect dome went from horizon to horizon in man's mind, covering it with grace. It was the most natural of all architectural forms, and the most celestial, for it aspired to recreate the sublime form under which humanity spent the days of its years. A dome of a church was not in competition with the dome of the sky; it was the same form in miniature, as a son to his father. Some people said the earth was round; for a man like himself whose travels had been confined between Venice and Rome, that was hard to prove. In Master Urbino's school of grammar he had been taught that the earth was flat, ending where the dome of heaven came down to its circular boundaries. Yet he had always observed a peculiar facet of that supposedly anchored-down horizon: as he walked or rode to reach it, it receded at an equal pace....</p>

  <p class="normal">Just so, his dome. It could not be finite. No man standing beneath it must ever feel that he could reach its boundaries. The sky was a perfect creation; whoever stood on the earth, wherever he might be, was centered at its heart, with the dome of heaven spread equidistant about him. Lorenzo, <i>Il Magnifico, </i>the Plato Four, the humanists had taught him that man was the center of the universe; and this was never more demonstrable than when he stood looking upward and found himself, a lone individual, serving as the central pole holding up the tarpaulin of sun and clouds, moon and stars, knowing that, lone or abandoned as he might feel, without his support the heavens would fall. Take away the dome as a shape, an idea, the symmetrical roof which sheltered man, and what was left of the world? Only a flat plate, the kind on which his stepmother, <i>Il Migliore, </i>had sliced her breads, hot out of the oven.</p>

  <p class="normal">No wonder man had placed heaven in the sky! It was not because he had ever seen a soul ascend thereto, or caught a glimpse of the vistas of paradise above; but because heaven simply had to be housed in the most divine form known to man's mind or senses. He wanted his dome too to be mystical, not a protection from heat or rain, thunder or lightning, but of a staggering beauty that would reassure man of His presence... a sentient form which man could not only see and feel but enter. Under his dome a man's soul must soar upward to God even as it would in the moment of its final release from his body. How much closer could man come to God, while still on earth? With his vast cupola he meant to paint His portrait just as surely as when he had painted Him on the Sistine ceiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">The saving of his own soul became part of the creation of the dome for St. Peter's. For his last great work he had assumed the most difficult task of the sixty-eight years since Granacci had taken him past the Street of the Painters, to the studio on the Via del Tavolini, and said, "Signor Ghirlandaio, this is Michelangelo, about whom I told you."</p>

  <p class="normal">His mind and fingers were moving with force and clarity. After drawing for hours he turned for refreshment to his crescent-shaped block. He changed his original concept of a Christ with head and knees turned in opposite directions for a version in which the head and knees concurred, but were contraposed to the Virgin's head above Christ's shoulder, affording a more dramatic contrast. He hollowed out a large figure from the crescent of the block before faltering. Then he returned to his dome.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was after absolute balance, perfection of line, curve, volume, mass, openness, density, elegance; the profundity of endless space. He aspired to create a work of art that would transcend the age through which he had lived.</p>

  <p class="normal">He laid aside his charcoal and drawing pens, started modeling, thinking that the maneuverability of the damp clay might bring him more freedom than the rigidity of the drawn line. Over the weeks and months he made a dozen models, destroying them, moving on to new designs. He felt he was coming closer to revelation, for he first achieved monumentality, then dimension, then majesty, then simplification; yet the results still derived from artistry rather than spirituality.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last it came, after eleven years of thinking, drawing, praying, hoping and despairing, experimenting and rejecting: a creature of his imagination, compounded of all his arts, staggering in size, yet as fragile as a bird's egg in a nest; soaring, lilting heavenward, constructed of gossamer which carried effortlessly and musically upward its three-hundred-and-thirty-five-foot height, pear-shaped, as was the breast of the Medici Madonna.... It was a dome unlike any other.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It has arrived," murmured Tommaso ecstatically, when he saw the completed drawings. "Where did it come from?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where do ideas come from, Tomao? Sebastiano asked that same question when he was young. I can only give you the answer I gave him, for I am no wiser at eighty-two than I was at thirty-nine: ideas are a natural function of the mind, as breathing is of the lungs. Perhaps they come from God."</p>

  <p class="normal">He hired a carpenter, Giovanni Francesco, to build the model. He made it of linden wood, one fifteen-thousandth of the projected size. The giant dome would rest on the piers and on the arches that the piers supported, and on a circular drum, or wide cement base. The drum would be built of brick with a sheathing of travertine; the external ribs of the dome would be of Tivoli travertine, the buttresses held to the drum by a framework of wrought iron, while the columns and horizontal entablatures would also be of travertine. Eight ramps along the lower drum would afford a means of carrying materials on the backs of donkeys up to the dome walls. The engineering plans took months to draw, but Michelangelo had the skill, Tommaso had become an expert.</p>

  <p class="normal">All work was done at the Macello dei Corvi studio, in the strictest privacy. The interior dome Michelangelo molded himself; the exterior one he let Francesco indicate with paint. The festooned carvings and decorations were made of clay mixed with sawdust and glue. He called in a reliable Carrara woodcarver by the name of Battista to cut out the statuettes and capitals, the bearded faces of the Apostles.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul IV died suddenly. Rome burst into the most violent insurrection Michelangelo had yet seen at the death of any pontiff. The crowd knocked down a newly erected statue of the former Cardinal Caraffa, dragged its head through the streets for hours while the citizenry heaped imprecations upon it, then threw the head into the Tiber before storming the headquarters of the Inquisition to release all prisoners and destroy the mass of papers and documents assembled to convict the accused of heresy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wearied of strife and bloodshed, the College of Cardinals elected sixty-year-old Giovanni Angelo Medici, from an obscure Lombardy branch of the Medici family. Pope Pius IV had been trained as a lawyer, was judicious of temperament. As a professional advocate he was a brilliant negotiator and soon came to be trusted in Europe as a man of integrity. The Inquisition, foreign to the Italian character, was ended. Through a series of legalistic conferences and contracts the Pope brought peace to Italy and the surrounding nations; and to the Lutherans as well. Guided by diplomacy, the Church achieved peace for itself at the same time that it reunited Catholicism in Europe.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Pius IV reconfirmed Michelangelo's position as architect of St. Peter's, providing him with funds with which to push the arches upward to the drum. He also commissioned him to design a gate for the city walls, to be called Porta Pia.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was clearly a race against time. He was approaching his mid-eighties. With a maximum of money and workmen he could reach the drum in perhaps two or three years. It was not possible for him to estimate just how long it would take to complete the dome, with its windows, columns and decorative frieze; but he thought he could do it in ten to twelve years. That would bring him to a round century mark. Nobody lived that long; but despite his attacks of the stone, pains in the head, a colic which brought disorders of the stomach, occasional aches in the back and loins, intermittent bouts of dizziness and weakness when he had to lie abed for a few days, he did not feel any true diminishing of his power. He still took walks in the <i>campagna.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">As he gazed into the mirror he saw that there was good color in his face. He had a vigorous shock of black hair on his head, albeit generously streaked with white, as was his forked beard. His eyes were clear and penetrating.</p>

  <p class="normal">He would get that dome built. Had not his father, Lodovico, achieved ninety? Was he not a better man than his father, by at least ten years?</p>

  <p class="normal">He had to go through yet one more ordeal by fire. Baccio Bigio, who had worked himself up to a high administrative position in the superintendent's office, had a documented set of figures to prove how many ducats Michelangelo's illness had cost the fabric because of the faulty chapel. He used his information to its fullest advantage, even convincing Michelangelo's friend, the Cardinal of Carpi, that St. Peter's was going badly. Bigio was putting himself into position to succeed to the job on the day Michelangelo took to his bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo no longer had the strength to climb the scaffolding each day, one of his able young helpers, Pier Luigi Gaeta, was appointed as assistant to the Clerk of the Works. Gaeta brought Michelangelo detailed reports each night. When the Clerk of the Works was murdered, Michelangelo proposed that Gaeta be promoted. Instead Baccio Bigio got the appointment. Gaeta was dismissed entirely. Bigio began to remove structural beams, take down scaffolding, and prepare the fabric for a new design.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo, crawling painfully up the scaffolding of time, past eighty-seven toward eighty-eight, was too stricken by the news to get out of his bed, which he had had moved into his studio.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But you must," cried Tommaso, trying to wake him from his lethargy, "or Bigio will undo the work you have done."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He who contends with the worthless achieves no great victory."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Forgive me, but this is not a time for Tuscan adages. It is a time for action. If you cannot go to St. Peter's today, you must send a deputy in your place."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you go, Tommaso?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"People know that I am as a son to you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then I will send Daniele da Volterra. He has so long outwitted the court with the breeches for the Last Judgment, he should be able to handle the conspirators in the superintendent's office."</p>

  <p class="normal">Daniele da Volterra was turned away. Baccio Bigio was given full building powers at the fabric. When Michelangelo encountered the Pope crossing the Campidoglio at the head of his train, he shouted crustily:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I insist that you make a change! If you do not, I shall return to Florence forever. You are letting St. Peter's be torn down."</p>

  <p class="normal">In his astringent courtroom manner Pope Pius IV replied:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Piano, piano, </span></i><span>Michelangelo, let us go into the Senatorial palace where we can talk."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope listened carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall summon the members of the fabric who have been opposing you. Then I shall ask my relative, Gabrio Serbelloni, to go to St. Peter's and investigate their charges. Come to the Vatican palace tomorrow."</p>

  <p class="normal">He arrived too early to be received by the Pope, wandered into the Stanza della Segnatura which Raphael had painted during the years when he himself was up in the Sistine vault. He gazed at the four frescoes, first the School of Athens, then Parnassus, then the Dispute and Justice. He had never before allowed himself to look at Raphael's work without prejudice. He knew that he could never have conceived or painted these idealized still lifes; yet seeing how exquisitely they were done, with what integrity of craftsmanship, he realized that for lyricism and romantic charm Raphael had been the master of them all. He left the Stanza in a philosophic frame of mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was ushered into the small throne room he found the Pope surrounded by the fabric committee which had dismissed Gaeta and refused to accept Daniele da Volterra. In a few minutes Gabrio Serbelloni entered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, I find not an iota of truth in this report written by Baccio Bigio. It is fabricated... but unlike the great fabric of Buonarroti, it is pasted together maliciously, with no discernible purpose except self-interest."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the voice of a judge handing down a decision Pope Pius decreed:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Baccio Bigio is herewith dismissed from St. Peter's. In the future, the plans of Michelangelo Buonarroti may not be altered in the smallest detail."</p>

  <p class="chapter">8.</p>

  <p class="normal">While the cathedral structure rose through its giant columns, arches and façades, Michelangelo spent his days in his studio completing the designs for the Porta Pia and, at the Pope's request, converting part of the ruins of the stupendous Baths of Diocletian into the lovely church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.</p>

  <p class="normal">Several years had passed since he had carved on his crescent-shaped marble. One afternoon while resting on his side in bed, the idea dawned on him that what he needed to mature the block was not merely a new form for the figures but a new form for sculpture itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rose, picked up his heaviest hammer and chisel and removed the head of Christ, carving a new face and head from what had been the Virgin's shoulder. He then dissected Christ's right arm from the body, just above the elbow, though the detached arm and hand remained as part of the supporting marble that went down to the base. What had previously been the left shoulder and part of the chest of Christ he converted into the left arm and hand of the Virgin. Christ's magnificent long legs were now out of proportion, constituting three fifths of the entire body. The new attenuation created an emotional effect of limpidity, youth and grace. Now he began to be satisfied. Through the distortion of the elongated figure he felt that he had achieved a truth about man: the heart might tire but humanity, carried on its ever young legs, would continue to move across the face of the earth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If only I had another ten years, or even five," he cried to the statues standing about him, "I could create a whole new sculpture."</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly darkness flooded over him. After a lapse of time he regained consciousness; but he was confused. He picked up his chisel, gazed at the limpid Christ. All continuity of thought was gone. He could not remember just what he had been doing with the marble. He knew that something had happened, but he could not collect his thoughts. Had he dropped off to sleep? Was he not quite awake? Then why did he feel a numbness and weakness in the left arm and leg? Why did the muscles on one side of his face feel as though they were sagging?</p>

  <p class="normal">He called his servant. When he asked her to summon Tommaso, he noticed that his speech was slurred. The elderly woman gazed at him, wide-eyed.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Messere, </span></i><span>are you all right?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">She helped him into bed, then put on a shawl to go through the streets. Tommaso returned with the Cavalieri doctor. Michelangelo could see by their expressions that something serious had occurred though they pretended that he had just overtired himself. Dr. Donati gave him a warm drink, stirring in a foul-tasting medicine.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Rest cures everything," said the doctor.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Except old age."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been hearing about your old age too long now to take it seriously," replied Tommaso, putting an extra pillow under his head. "I'll stay here until you sleep."</p>

  <p class="normal">He awakened to find deep night outside his window. He lifted himself gingerly. The headache was gone, and he could see all too clearly the work that was still required on the crescent Pietà. He rose, put a goat candle in his cap, returned to his carving. The confusion was gone from his mind. It was good to have the feel of marble at his fingertips. He blinked his eyes to stave off the flying chips as he made a slashing "Go!" up the right side and around the shoulder, his calligraphic strokes pulsating on the marble torso and melting into space.</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn Tommaso opened the street door cautiously, burst into laughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why, you rogue! You pretender! I left you at midnight, deep enough asleep to stay for a week. I come back a few hours later, and find a snowstorm."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Delicious smell, isn't it, Tomao? When the white dust cakes inside my nostrils, that's when I breathe the best."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Dr. Donati says you need rest."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the next world, <i>caro. </i>Paradise is already replete with sculptures. There'll be nothing for me to do but rest."</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked all day, had supper with Tommaso, then threw himself on the bed for a few hours of sleep before rising to fix another candle in his cap and begin polishing, starting with pumice and sulphur, then going to straw, giving the elongated legs of Christ a finish like satin.</p>

  <p class="normal">He forgot all about the attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">Two days later, as he stood before his marble, deciding that it was now safe to cut away the superfluous arm and hand to further release the elongated figure in space, he was struck again. He dropped his hammer and chisel, stumbled to the bed, fell on his knees, with his face sideways on the blanket.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he awakened the room was full of people: Tommaso, Dr. Donati and Dr. Fidelissimi, Gaeta, Daniele da Volterra, a number of Florentine friends. Facing him was the disembodied forearm of the statue which throbbed with a life all its own. On the inside of the elbow was a vein, bulging with blood and life; though suspended in space, it existed. He had not been able to destroy it, any more than the centuries of being buried and trod upon had destroyed the Laocoön. Gazing at his own vein on the inside of his elbow, he saw how flat and withered it appeared. He thought:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Man passes. Only works of art are immortal."</p>

  <p class="normal">He insisted on sitting in a chair before the fire. Once when he was left alone he slipped a robe over his shoulders and started walking in the rain in the direction of St. Peter's. One of his newer apprentices, Calcagni, met him in the street, asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Master, do you think it right to be about in such weather?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He allowed Calcagni to take him home, but at four the next afternoon he dressed and tried to mount his horse for a ride. His legs were too weak.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rome came to bid him farewell. Those who could not be admitted left flowers and gifts on the doorstep. Dr. Donati tried to keep him in bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't hurry me," he said to the doctor. "My father lived to his ninetieth birthday, so I still have two weeks to enjoy this salubrious life."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As long as you're feeling so intrepid," commented Tommaso, "what about a carriage ride in the morning? The last work on the drum is complete. To celebrate your ninetieth birthday, they're going to start the first ring of the dome."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Grazie a Dio, </span></i><span>thank God. No one will ever be able to change it now. But all the same, it's sad to have to die. I would like to start all over again, to create forms and figures I have never dreamed of." His amber-speckled eyes were unwavering. "I like best to work in white marble."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"You've had your <i>divertimento, </i>fun."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night, as he lay sleepless in bed, he thought, "Life has been good. God did not create me to abandon me. I have loved marble, yes, and paint too. I have loved architecture, and poetry too. I have loved my family and my friends. I have loved God, the forms of the earth and the heavens, and people too. I have loved life to the full, and now I love death as its natural termination. <i>Il Magnifico </i>would be happy: for me, the forces of destruction never overcame creativity."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was swept by a massive wave of darkness. Before he lost consciousness he said to himself, "I must see Tommaso. There are things to be done."</p>

  <p class="normal">When he next opened his eyes Tommaso was sitting on the edge of the bed. He put an arm under Michelangelo and raised him up, holding his head against his chest.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tomao..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am here, <i>caro."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"I want to be buried in Santa Croce with my family..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope wants you buried in your own church, St. Peter's."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not... home. Promise you will take me back to Florence... ?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope will forbid it, but the Florentine merchants can smuggle you out the Porta del Popolo in a caravan of goods...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My will, Tomao." His strength was ebbing. "I commit my soul into the hands of God... my body to the earth, and my substance to my family... the Buonarroti..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It will all be done. I shall finish the Campidoglio, exactly as you planned. With St. Peter's at one end, and the Capitol at the other, Rome will forevermore be Michelangelo's as much as Caesar's, or Constantino's."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, Tommaso.... I am tired..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso kissed Michelangelo on the brow, withdrew weeping.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dusk was falling. Alone in the room, Michelangelo began to review the images of all the beautiful works he had created. He saw them, one by one, as clearly as the day he had made them, the sculptures, paintings and architecture succeeding each other as swiftly as had the years of his life:</p>

  <p class="normal">The Madonna of the Stairs and the Battle of the Centaurs he had carved for Bertoldo and <i>Il Magnifico, </i>with the Plato group laughing at him because he had made them "pure Greek"; Sts. Proculus and Petronius that he had made for Aldovrandi in Bologna; the wooden Crucifix for Prior Bichiellini; the Sleeping Cupid with which he had tried to fool the dealer in Rome; the Bacchus he had carved in Jacopo Galli's orchard; the Pietà that Cardinal Groslaye di Dionigi had commissioned for St. Peter's; the Giant David for Gonfaloniere Soderini and Florence; the Holy Family teased out of him by Agnolo Doni; the cartoon for the Battle of Cascina, called the Bathers, to compete with Leonardo da Vinci's; the Madonna and Child for the merchants of Bruges, carved in his own first studio; the ill-fated bronze portrait of Pope Julius II; Genesis, painted for Julius II on the vault of the Sistine; the Last Judgment for Pope Paul III to complete the chapel; the Moses for Julius' tomb; his four unfinished Giants in Florence; the Dawn and Dusk, Night and Day for the Medici chapel; the Conversion of Paul and the Crucifixion of Peter for the Pauline chapel; the Campidoglio, Porta Pia, the three Pietàs sculptured for his own pleasure... and as the pictures came to a stop and stood still in his mind's eye, St. Peter's.</p>

  <p class="normal">St. Peter's.... He entered the church through its front portal, walked in the strong Roman sunshine down the wide nave, stood below the center of the dome, just over the tomb of St. Peter. He felt his soul leave his body, rise upward into the dome, becoming part of it: part of space, of time, of heaven, and of God.</p>
