  <h1>BOOK SIX:<br/>The Giant</h1>

  <p class="normal">The warm June Florentine sun flooded his face as he gazed out the window at the tawny stone towerhouse of the superintendent of the Florentine Guilds. Returning from Rome with no commissions, and no funds, he had been obliged to send Argiento back to his family's farm outside Ferrara, and himself return to his father's board. However, he occupied the front and best room of the commodious apartment in which the Buonarroti now lived, for Lodovico had invested some part of the Rome earnings to good advantage. He had bought a small house in San Pietro Maggiore, used the income from it to clear the title to the disputed Buonarroti property near Santa Croce, then raised the family's social position by renting this floor in this house in the more fashionable Street of St. Proculus, a block from the superb stone pile of the Pazzi palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">The death of Lucrezia had aged Lodovico; his face was thinner, the cheeks sunken; in compensation he had allowed his hair to grow in a thick mass down to his shoulders. As Jacopo Galli had predicted, nothing had come of the business Michelangelo had hoped to set up for Buonarroto and Giovansimone. Buonarroto had at last settled down in the Strozzi wool shop near the Porta Rossa; Giovansimone was a crushed youth, apathetically taking jobs, then disappearing after a few weeks. Sigismondo, barely able to read and write, was earning a few scudi as a hired soldier for Florence in its present hostilities against Pisa. Lionardo had disappeared, no one knew into what monastery. His aunt Cassandra and uncle Francesco were beset with minor ills. He and Granacci had clasped each other in a hilarious embrace, happy to be together. During the past years Granacci had come into the first half of his fortune and, as the gossip Jacopo of the Ghirlandaio <i>bottega </i>reported gleefully, was keeping a mistress in a villa in the hills of Bellosguardo, above the Porta Romana. Granacci still maintained his headquarters at Ghirlandaio's, helping out David Ghirlandaio after his brother Benedetto's death, in return for using the studio for his own work. He riffled through the sketches on Michelangelo's worktable.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Open for business, I see."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Best-stocked shop in Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Any customers?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"None. I'm joining Soggi."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci chuckled. "He's been quite a success. Just bought space for a butcher shop in the New Market."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Bertoldo method of carving calves."</p>

  <p class="normal">They set out for an <i>osteria </i>under the trees, turned left on the Via del Proconsolo, past the gracious Badia church, into the Borgo dei Greci with its Serristori palace designed by Baccio d'Agnolo and into the Via dei Benci. Here were the ancient Ghibelline Bardelli palace and the first of the Alberti palaces, with its columned courtyard and capitals by Giuliano da Sangallo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Florence spoke to him. The stones spoke to him. He felt their character, the variety of structures, the strength of their impacted layers. How wonderful to be back where <i>pietra serena </i>was the material of architecture. To some people stone was dead; "hard as stone," "stone cold," they said. To him, as he once again ran his fingers along its contours, it was the most alive substance in the world, rhythmic, responsive, tractable: warm, resilient, colorful, vibrant. He was in love with stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">The restaurant was on the Lungarno, located in a garden shaded by fig trees. The owner, who was also the cook, went down to the river, raised a basket on ropes, wiped off a bottle of Trebbiano on his apron and opened it at the table. They drank to Michelangelo's return.</p>

  <p class="normal">He climbed the familiar Settignano hills to see the Topolinos, found that Bruno and Enrico had married. Each had added a stone room for his new family on the far side of the house. Already there were five grandchildren, and both wives were again pregnant. He commented:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Topolinos are going to control all the <i>pietra serena </i>carving of Florence, if you keep up this pace."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We'll keep up," said Bruno. The mother added, "Your friend, Contessina de' Medici, she too had another son, after her daughter died."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had already learned that Contessina had been banished from Florence and lived in exile with her husband and son in a peasant's house on the north slope of Fiesole, their home and possessions having been confiscated when her father-in-law, Niccolò Ridolfi, was hanged for participating in a conspiracy to overthrow the Republic and bring Piero back as King of Florence. His affection for Contessina had not changed, though the years had passed without his seeing her. He had never felt wanted at the Ridolfi palace, and so he had not gone to visit; how then could he go to her after his return from Rome, when she was living in poverty and disgrace? Might not any visit, now that they were plagued by misfortune, be construed as pity?</p>

  <p class="normal">The city itself had undergone many perceivable changes in the almost five years he had been gone. Walking through the Piazza della Signoria, the people bowed their heads in shame when they passed the spot where Savonarola's body had been burned; at the same time they were smothering their consciences under a tornado of activity, trying to replace what Savonarola had destroyed, spending large sums with the gold- and silver-smiths, the gem cutters, the costume makers, the embroiderers, designers of terra-cotta and wood mosaics, the makers of musical instruments, the manuscript illuminators. Piero Soderini, whom Lorenzo de' Medici had trained as the brightest of the young men in politics, and whom Michelangelo had often seen at the palace, was now at the head of the Florentine Republic as <i>gonfaloniere, </i>or mayor-governor of Florence and the city-state. He had achieved a measure of harmony among the Florentine factions for the first time since the mortal battle between Lorenzo and Savonarola had begun.</p>

  <p class="normal">Florentine artists who had fled the city had sensed the upsurge of activity and returned from Milan, Venice, Portugal, Paris: Piero di Cosimo, Filippino Lippi, Andrea Sansovino, Benedetto da Rovezzano, Leonardo da Vinci, Benedetto Buglioni. Those whose work had been stopped by Savonarola's influence and power were now producing again: Botticelli, Pollaiuolo, the architect, known as <i>Il Cronaca, </i>the storyteller, Rosselli, Lorenzo di Credi, Baccio da Montelupo, jester and scandal bearer of the Medici sculpture garden. They had organized a Company of the Cauldron, and while it was restricted to only twelve members, each was allowed to bring four guests to the monthly dinner meeting in Rustici's enormous sculpture studio. Granacci was a member. He had immediately invited Michelangelo to accompany him. Michelangelo had refused, preferring to wait until he had a commission.</p>

  <p class="normal">The months since his return had contained little real pleasure. He had left for Rome a boy, returned a man, ready to carve mountains of marble; but as he turned to gaze sightlessly at his Madonna and Child and Centaurs, which he had affixed on nails to the side wall of his combination workroom and bedroom, he thought unhappily that as far as Florence knew he might never have carved the Bacchus or Pietà.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli was still working for him in Rome: the Mouscron brothers from Bruges, who imported cloth from England into Rome, had seen the Pietà and were interested in a Madonna and Child. Galli thought he could secure an excellent contract on the Mouscrons' next visit to Rome. He had also interested Cardinal Piccolomini in employing Michelangelo to carve the figures needed to complete the family altar honoring his uncle Pope Pius II, in the cathedral in Siena.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Without Galli," he muttered, "I'm out of business. While the grass is growing, the horse starves."</p>

  <p class="normal">Immediately on his return he had gone to the Duomo workshop to study the seventeen-foot Duccio column called by some a "thin piece," by others "emaciated," to search its innerness for ideas, testing it again and reiterating to Beppe:</p>

  <p class="normal">"<i>Il marmo è sano. </i>The marble is sound."</p>

  <p class="normal">At night he read by candlelight in Dante and in the Old Testament, looking for a mood and a heroic theme.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he learned that the members of the Wool Guild and the Board of Works of the cathedral had been unable to make up their minds about the carving of the giant block. It was just as well, thought Michelangelo, for he also had heard that many favored giving the commission to Leonardo da Vinci, recently returned to Florence, because of the magnificent reputation of his huge equestrian statue of Count Sforza, and his painting of the Last Supper in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had never met Leonardo, who had abandoned Florence for Milan some eighteen years before, after being acquitted on a morals charge; but Florentine artists were saying that he was the greatest draftsman in Italy. Nettled, curious, Michelangelo had gone to Santissima Annunziata when the cartoon for Leonardo's Virgin and Child and St. Anne was on exhibition. He had stood before the cartoon with his heart beating like a hammer. Never had he seen such power or authenticity of drawing, such forceful truth about the figure, except, of course, in his own work. In a folio on a bench he had found the sketch of a male nude seen from the rear, with arms and legs outstretched. No one had rendered the male figure in this fashion, so galvanically alive and convincing. Leonardo, he was certain, had dissected! He had pulled the bench up in front of the three figures and plunged into copying, had left the church chastened. If the Boards granted the commission to Leonardo, who could contest their decision? Could he, with only a few reports of his Bacchus and Pietà beginning to filter northward to indicate his stature?</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Leonardo had rejected the commission. On the grounds that he despised marble sculpture as an inferior art, good only for artisans. Michelangelo heard the news in a state of turmoil. He was glad to have the Duccio block free, and Leonardo da Vinci out of the running; but he felt a resentment against the man for his belittling statement, which all Florence took up and was repeating.</p>

  <p class="normal">One darkness before dawn he rose, dressed hurriedly, ran through the empty Via del Proconsolo to the Duomo workshop, and stood at the corner of the column. The diagonal beams of first sunlight streamed across the marble, projecting his shadow upward the full seventeen-foot length of the column, magnifying his silhouette and turning him into a giant. He caught his breath, thought of David as he knew his story from the Bible. "This is how David must have felt," he told himself, "on that morning when he stepped forth to face Goliath." A Giant for the symbol of Florence!</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned home, reread the David chapter with heightened perception. For days he drew from memory virile male figures, seeking a David worthy of the biblical legend. He submitted design after design to his former Medici palace acquaintance, Gonfaloniere Soderini; to the Wool Guild; to the Board of Works of the cathedral. But nothing happened. He was stalemated; and he was burning up with marble fever.</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">His father was waiting for him in a black leather chair in the family room at the rear of the apartment. On his lap was an envelope which had just arrived on the Rome post. Michelangelo opened it with a knife. Inside were several closely written sheets in Jacopo Galli's handwriting informing Michelangelo that he was about to get Cardinal Piccolomini's signature on a contract. "However, I must warn you," Galli wrote, "that it is by no means the kind of commission you want or deserve."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Read it to me," cried Lodovico, his dark amber eyes alight with pleasure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's face dropped as he learned that he would have to carve fifteen small figures, all of them fully clothed, to fit into the narrow niches of an Andrea Bregno traditional altar. The drawings would have to be approved by the cardinal, and the marbles recarved if the final pieces did not please His Grace. The pay was five hundred ducats; Michelangelo could take no other contract for three years, by the end of which time the final figure had to be completed and approved.</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico warmed his hands in front of his chest as though it were a brazier.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Five hundred gold ducats for three years' work. Not as good as you did in Rome, but added to our rents, a modest living."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not really, Father. I must pay for the marble. And if the cardinal doesn't approve I must rework the figures or carve altogether new ones."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Since when can't you please a cardinal? If Galli, a shrewd banker, is willing to guarantee you make the best statues in Italy, why should we be foolish enough to worry? How much are they paying in advance? 'He that gives quickly, gives twice.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is no advance."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do they imagine you are going to buy supplies? Do they think the money is coming from me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, Father, I'm sure they know better than that."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thanks to God! Galli must make it part of the contract that they advance you one hundred gold ducats before you begin work. Then we're safe."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo slumped into a chair.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Three years of carving draperies. And never once a figure of my own choosing."</p>

  <p class="normal">He jumped up out of the chair, ran through the apartment and slammed out the door. He took the short cut past the Bargello and the Piazza San Firenze, through a narrow side street into the blazing light of the Piazza della Signoria. He turned aside from a pile of fine gray ash, put there in the deep of night by the faithful to commemorate the spot where Savonarola had been burned, went to the broad steps leading up into the Signoria courtyard. On the left was a stone staircase which he took three steps at a time, then was in the majestic high-ceilinged Council Hall where the meetings of the Florentine Council were held, with space for a thousand citizens to take their stand. The vast hall was empty and bare except for a table and a dozen chairs on a podium at the far side.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to a door on his left admitting to the chambers which had always been occupied by the <i>podestà, </i>such as his friend Gianfrancesco Aldovrandi had been, but was now occupied by Piero Soderini, latest in the tradition of sixteen Soderini ancestors who had been Gonfalonieri before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was readily admitted to Soderini's office. It was a magnificent corner room overlooking the piazza and rooftops of much of Florence; elegant, paneled in dark wood, with a broad ceiling painted with the lilies of Florence. Behind a massive oak desk sat the chief magistrate of the Republic. On his last trip to Rome, Soderini had been told by the Florentine colony about the Bacchus, and been taken to St. Peter's to see the Pietà.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Benvenuto," </span></i><span>Soderini murmured, "what brings you to the seat of your government on this warm afternoon?"</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Troubles, Gonfaloniere," replied Michelangelo, "but I suppose no one comes up here to unburden his pleasures?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's why I sit behind such a capacious desk: so that it can hold all the problems of Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is your shoulders that are broad."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini ducked his head deprecatingly: by no means a handsome head. At fifty-one his blond hair, covered by a strangely shaped cap, was bleaching white, his chin was long and pointed, his nose hooked, his skin yellowish, the eyebrows irregularly arched over mild hazel eyes that were devoid of audacity or cunning. Florence said that Soderini had three virtues not combined in any other Tuscan of the day: he was honest, he was plain, and he could induce opposing factions to work together.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo told Piero Soderini about the proposed Piccolomini contract.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't want this commission, Gonfaloniere. I'm on fire to carve the Giant! Can't you force the Boards of the Duomo and the Wool Guild to decide about the competition? If I don't get it, at least it will be out of my range of possibility. I could go on to this Piccolomini contract as something I can't escape."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was breathing hard. Soderini gazed at him blandly across the broad desk.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is not a good time to force things. We're exhausted from our war with Pisa. Caesar Borgia is threatening to conquer Florence. Last night the Signoria bought him off. Thirty-six thousand gold florins a year for three years, his salary for serving as captain general of the Florentine forces."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Blackmail," said Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini's face turned red. "Many do kiss the hand they wish to see cut off. The city has no way of knowing how much more it will have to pay Caesar Borgia. The Guilds have to provide this money to the Signoria. So you can understand why the Wool Guild is not in the mood to discuss a sculpture competition."</p>

  <p class="normal">An emotional silence filled the space between them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Hadn't you better be more receptive to the Piccolomini offer?" suggested Soderini.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo groaned. "Cardinal Piccolomini wants to choose all fifteen subjects. I cannot carve until he approves the designs. And what wages: thirty-three and a third ducats for each figure, enough to pay rent, buy supplies..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How long since you've carved marble?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"More than a year."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Or been paid?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"More than two."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's lips trembled. "You don't understand. This altar was made by Bregno. All the marbles have to be fully clothed; they must go into dark niches where they will be seen only as rigid still lifes. How can I tie up three whole years of my life filling Bregno's highly decorated altar with more decorations?"</p>

  <p class="normal">His agonized cry hung heavily in the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do today what you must do today," said Soderini in an annealing voice. "Tomorrow you will be free to do what you must do tomorrow. We bought off Caesar Borgia. For you as an artist it is the same as with us as a city-state; only one law prevails: survival."</p>

  <p class="normal">At Santo Spirito, Prior Bichiellini, sitting behind the desk in his manuscript-lined office, pushed his papers aside, his eyes blazing behind the spectacles.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Survival on what plane? To stay alive as an animal stays alive? For shame! The Michelangelo I knew six years ago could never think, 'Better mediocre work than no work at all.' This is opportunism, fit for mediocre talent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I agree, Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then don't take the commission. Do the best that is in you, or nothing at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the long run, you are right; in the short run I suppose Soderini and my father are right."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are no long and short runs," the prior cried, his voice heavy with indignation. There is only a God-given number of years in which to work and fulfill yourself. Don't squander them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo hung his head in shame.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If I sound like a moralist," said the prior quietly, "please remember that it is my job to be concerned with your character."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo went out into the bright sunlight, sat on the edge of the fountain in the Piazza Santo Spirito and splashed cold water on his face, even as he had on those nights when he had emerged from the dead room. He groaned aloud, "Three years! <i>Dio mio!"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Back in his studio, Granacci barely listened to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Without work, Michelagnolo, you are the most wretched creature alive. What does it matter if you have to carve dull statues? Your worst will be better than anybody else's best."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're maddening: you insult and flatter me in the same breath."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci grinned. "Do as many figures as you have time for. Everybody in Florence will help you outwit Siena."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Outwit a cardinal?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci grew serious. "I'm trying to face reality. You want to carve, ergo, take the Piccolomini contract and do the best you can. When something better comes along, you'll sculpture better. Come and have dinner with me and the Company."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo shook his head. "No."</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to the drawing board, to sketches of the Madonna for the Mouscrons, attempts to capture saints for the Piccolomini contract. But he could think of nothing but the Duccio column and the Giant-David. In 1 Kings 16:17, he found himself reading:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Meanwhile the Lord's spirit passed away from Saul... an evil mood came upon him that gave him no rest. When Saul said, "Find one who can play the harp well, and bring him to me," one of his servants replied, "I myself have met such a man, a skillful player indeed, a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite. He is sturdy besides and a tried warrior, well spoken and personable, and the Lord is with him..."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Some time later, when Saul questioned the wisdom of David's meeting Goliath in battle, David replied:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>"My Lord, I used to feed my father's flock; and if lion or bear came and carried off one of my rams, I would go in pursuit and get the mastery and snatch the prey from their jaws. Did they threaten me, I would catch them by the throat and strangle them. Lion or bear, my Lord, I would slay them."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">He sat staring at the lines: "lion or bear... I would catch them by the throat and strangle them." Was there any greater feat of strength or courage in the Bible? A young man, without weapons or armor, had pursued the most powerful of beasts, caught them and strangled them with his bare bands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Could any of the Davids he had seen in Florence have conceived such an act, let alone executed it? In the morning he stopped before the Castagno painting, gazing at the youthful David, with slender arms and legs, small hands and feet, a mass of hair blowing about the delicate-featured, pretty face, somehow seeming halfway between man and woman. He next went to see Antonio Pollaiuolo's David Victor, somewhat older than Castagno's, with feet solidly on the ground, but with tiny, ladylike fingers crooked as though he were about to eat a custard. There was a well-developed torso and a determination about the stance, but he was dressed in the lace-trimmed coat with matching lace undershirt of a Florentine nobleman, the most expensively, aristocratically dressed shepherd boy on earth, mused Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ran to the Palazzo della Signoria, mounted the steps to the Sala dei Gigli. Outside the door stood Verrocchio's bronze David, a wistful adolescent. Inside the Sala was Donatello's first David, carved in marble. Michelangelo never saw it but he gasped at the sensitivity and finish of the flesh. The hands were strong, the one visible leg under the long, luxuriant robe was heavier than in the paintings of Castagno and Pollaiuolo, the neck thicker. But the eyes were blank, there was a flaccid underchin, a weak mouth, a wreath of leaves and berries crowning the expressionless face.</p>

  <p class="normal">He descended the stone steps to the courtyard and stood before Donatello's bronze David, with which he had lived for two years in the courtyard of the Medici, and which had been appropriated by the city after the sack of the palace. It was a sculpture he admired passionately, the legs and feet sturdy enough to carry the body, with strong arms and neck. Yet now that he looked at it critically he saw that, like the other Florentine Davids, this one had pretty features, an almost feminine face under the decorated hat, and long curls hanging down over the shoulders. Though it had the genitals of a young boy, it also had the budding breasts of a young girl. He returned home, fragments of ideas racing through his mind. These Davids, particularly the two beloved Donatellos, were boys. They could no more have strangled lions and bears than they could have killed the Goliath whose head rested between their feet. Why had the best artists of Florence depicted David as either an adolescent or an elegantly garbed and groomed young dandy? Had no other artist read beyond the description of David as "red-cheeked, fair of face, pleasant of mien"; had they not gone on to, "Did they threaten me, I would catch them by the throat and strangle them. Lion or bear... I would slay them."</p>

  <p class="normal">David was a man! He had accomplished these feats before the Lord chose him. What he did he did alone, with his great heart and great hands. Such a man would not hesitate to face a Goliath so gigantic that he could carry a breastplate of mail weighing a thousand pounds. What was Goliath to a young man who had mixed with lions and bears and beaten them in fair battle?</p>

  <p class="normal">At dawn he walked streets still wet from their scrubbing, carrying his measuring equipment to the Duomo workyard. He computed his figures on the column, calculated to a hairs-breadth the distance between the deepest point of gouging to the point on the opposite side to see if it were possible to design a David whose thighs, the shortest distance across the body, could be fitted into the marble that was left.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No good," commented Beppe. "For fifty years I watch sculptors measure across here. Always they say, 'Too bad. No figure will fit.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a matter of invention, Beppe. Look, I'll draw <i>la sagoma, </i>the silhouette of the block, for you. This dot indicates the deepest point of gouging, halfway down the column. Now suppose we were to swivel the hips away from this narrow area, and opposite use a strongly outpushing wrist or hand to compensate...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe raked his behind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah," cried Michelangelo, "you think it might work! I can tell how pleased you are by what part of your anatomy you scratch."</p>

  <p class="normal">The weeks passed. He learned that Rustici had decided that the project was too big for him. Sansovino required an added block of marble to get anything out of the Duccio column. The half dozen other sculptors in town, including Baccio, Buglioni and Benedetto da Rovezzano, had walked away from the column, saying that since the deep gouging had been done midway down its length it must certainly break in two at that narrow point.</p>

  <p class="normal">A courier brought a packet from Rome containing the Piccolomini contract:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>...The most Reverend Cardinal of Siena commits to Michelangelo, son of Lodovico Buonarroti-Simoni, sculptor from Florence, to make fifteen statues of Carrara marble, which is to be new, clean, and white and not veined, but as perfect as it is necessary to make first-quality statues, each one of which should be two braccia high, and which should be completed in three years for the amount of five hundred large gold ducats...</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli had secured an advance of a hundred ducats by guaranteeing to return the money to Cardinal Puccolomini if Michelangelo died before he finished the last three statues. Cardinal Piccolomini approved Michelangelo's first sketches. But there was a line in the contract which carried the crowning indignity. "As a figure of St. Francis has already been sculptured by Pietro Torrigiani, who left the draperies and head unfinished, Michelangelo will complete the statue out of honor and courtesy, in Siena, so that the statue can stand among the others made by him, and anybody who sees it would say that it is the work of Michelangelo's hand."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I never knew that Torrigiani started this contract," Michelangelo cried to Granacci. "Think of the ignominy of my scavenging after him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Harsh words," said Granacci. "Let's just say that Torrigiani was incapable of finishing even one figure adequately, and so Cardinal Piccolomini had to turn to you to make it right."</p>

  <p class="normal">Galli urged that Michelangelo sign the contract and commence work at once. "Next spring, when the Mouscron brothers come from Bruges, I will get you that free-standing Madonna and Child to carve. There will be better things for the future."</p>

  <p class="normal">He gathered up an armful of new sketches for the David and went again to plead with Piero Soderini. The commission must come to him if only the Gonfaloniere could force the Wool Guild to act.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, I might force it through," agreed Soderini. "But then the Boards would have acted against their will. They would resent you. They must want this piece carved and must choose you as their sculptor. You perceive the difference?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes," replied Michelangelo sadly, "it makes sense. Only I can't wait any longer."</p>

  <p class="normal">Off the Via del Proconsolo, a few steps down from the Badia, was an archway that looked as though it led into the courtyard of a palace. Michelangelo had passed it innumerable times on his way from his house to the sculpture garden, and knew that it provided the opening to an artisans' piazza, a private world surrounded by the backs of palaces, truncated towers and two-story houses. It sheltered some twenty workshops of leather tanners, coppersmiths, carpenters, wool dyers, flax weavers, scissors makers preparing their products for the shops in the open markets and on the popular streets of the Corso and Pellicceria. Here he found a workshop for rent, one that had been occupied by a shoemaker, on the south side of the oval-shaped piazza, getting most of the day's sun. He paid three months' rent in advance, sent a letter in care of the Gesuati of Ferrara to Argiento telling him to come back to work, bought a truckle bed for the shop for him to sleep on.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the June heat the craftsmen worked at benches in front of their narrow slots, the dyers' arms stained blue, green and red, the metalworkers in their leather aprons, bare to their burly waists, the carpenters sawing, planing, filling the air with clean-smelling shavings; all making the indigenous noises of their trade, blended together compactly in the closed-in area, creating the kind of companionable background music in which Michelangelo felt at home. Surrounded by simple workmen, the workshop afforded him the same busy privacy he had enjoyed from his worktable in Rome, overlooking the bustle of the Bear Hotel.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento arrived, dust-covered and footsore, chattering straight through a morning as he scrubbed out the vestiges of the shoemaker's tenancy, unable to contain his relief at being off his brother's farm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Argiento, I don't understand. In Rome you walked into the <i>campagna</i> every Sunday to see the horses..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento raised his perspiration-streaked face from his bucket of suds. "Farms I like to visit, not to work."</p>

  <p class="normal">The carpenter across the way helped them build a drafting table just inside the door. Argiento scoured the Street of the Ironmongers to find a secondhand forge. Michelangelo bought iron rods, baskets of chestnut wood to make his chisels. He found two blocks of marble in Florence, sent specifications for three more to Carrara. Then, without clay or wax models, without looking at the designs approved by Cardinal Piccotomini, he set up the four-foot blocks and in the sheer joy of having his hands back in marble carved first the St. Paul, bearded, with fine features bespeaking the first Christian missionary's Roman citizenship and contact with Greek culture, the body, though covered by voluminous robes, muscular and tense. Without pause he went on to the St. Peter, closest of Christ's disciples, witness of Christ's resurrection, a rock on which the new Church was founded. This statue was quieter physically and mentally, reflective in spirit, with an interesting arrangement of vertical draperies accented by a softly flowing horizontal scarf over the chest and arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">The workmen of the piazza accepted him as another skilled artisan who arrived in laborer's clothes at dawn, just after an apprentice had washed down the communal square, and who quit at dark, his hair, face, nostrils, shirt, bare legs and feet covered with white marble dust, even as they were covered with wood shavings or dye or tiny strands of leather or flax. Sometimes one of them would call out in a full voice above the saws, hammers and scraping knives, while Michelangelo's chisels were singing through the white marble like plows through the spring earth:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a miracle! All Florence swelters in the heat, and in our piazza we have a snowstorm."</p>

  <p class="normal">He kept the whereabouts of his workshop a secret from everyone except Granacci, whose visit on the way home to his midday dinner brought Michelangelo news of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't believe it! You signed the contract on June 19; here it is only the middle of July, and you have two of the statues completed. They're quite good, in spite of all your moaning that you could carve nothing worth while. At this rate you'll be finished with the fifteen statues in seven months."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gazed at his St. Peter and St. Paul, replied soberly: "These first two figures are not bad, they contain my hunger to carve. But once they're shoved into those narrow niches, they'll die a quick death. The next two statues are of Pope Pius II and Gregory the Great, in their full papal crowns and long stiff robes..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why don't you go to Siena," Granacci interrupted, "and get rid of Torrigiani? You'll feel better."</p>

  <p class="normal">He left that day.</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tuscany is a state of grace. The countryside is so lovingly designed that the eye sweeps the mountains and valleys without stumbling over a single stone. The lilt of the rolling green hills, the upsurging cypresses, the terraces sculptured by generations that have handled the rocks with skillful tenderness, the fields geometrically juxtaposed as though drawn by a draftsman for beauty as well as productivity; the battlements of castles on the hills, their tall towers standing gray-blue and golden tan among the forest of trees, the air of such clarity that every sod of earth stands out in dazzling detail. Below him the fields were ripening with July barley and oats, beans and beets; on both sides of the road the grape-heavy vines were espaliered between the horizontal branches of silver-green olive trees, composing orchards of webbed design, rich in intimation of wine, olive oil and lacy-leaf poetry.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had a sense of physical delight as his horse moved along the contours of a ridge, rising ever higher into the flawless Italian sky, the air he breathed so pure that his whole being felt ennobled, meanness and pettiness falling away from him: a rapture he experienced only when he carved white marble. Tuscany untied the knots in a man's intestines, wiped out the ills of his world. God and man had combined to create this supreme work of art. Pictorially, Michelangelo thought, this might be the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve had departed, but to his sculptor's eye, scanning the undulating ranges which flowed backward in space with the lyricism of the green river winding through the valley below him, dotted with stone houses, sun-mellowed tile roofs, hayricks, Tuscany was paradise. He recited a verse from his childhood:</p>

  <p class="versi">Italy is the garden of Europe,</p>

  <p class="versi">Tuscany is the garden of Italy,</p>

  <p class="versi">Florence is the flower of Tuscany.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward sundown he reached the heights above Poggibonsi, the Apennines covered with virgin forest, rivers and lakes shining like rolled silver under the oblique sunset rays. He descended the long hill to Poggibonsi, a wine center, dropped his saddlebag in a scrubbed, bare-floored inn, then climbed the hill beyond the town to explore Giuliano da Sangallo's towering Poggio Imperiale, a fortress palace that Lorenzo had ordered built to keep invading armies from passing beyond this heavily fortified point which controlled the valley leading to Florence. But Lorenzo had died; the Poggio Imperiale had been abandoned....</p>

  <p class="normal">He scrambled down the rocky footpath. He was served supper in the yard of the inn, slept soundly, rose at cockcrow and set out on the second half of his journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">Siena was a warm reddish-brown city, made of brick from its reddish-brown earth, even as Bologna was a burnt-orange city from its native earth. He entered the gate of the encompassing city wall, made his way to the Piazza del Campo, shell-shaped, running rapidly downhill from its top line of private palaces to the Palazzo Pubblico at the other end, and piercing the skies above in the beautiful and daring Tower of Mangia, a breath-taking stone sculpture.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked to the center of the piazza around which Siena ran its mad horse race each summer, to Della Quercia's lovely fountain, then mounted a steep flight of stone steps and came to the Baptistery, with its baptismal font sculptured by Della Quercia, Donatello and Ghiberti.</p>

  <p class="normal">After circling the font to study the work of Italy's best sculptors, he left the Baptistery and climbed the mountain-steep hill to the cathedral. He stood gaping in awe at the black and white marble façade with its magnificent carved figures by Giovanni Pisano, its rose windows, black and white marble Campanile. Inside, the floor was a mine of marble slabs, inlaid with black and white marquetry depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then his heart sank. Before him stood the Bregno altar, the niches shallower than he had imagined, each of them topped by a heavily incised shell-like dome, against which the heads and faces of his figures would have to be seen, draining their expression. Some of the niches stood so high in the air that no one on the floor would know what kind of sculpture they contained.</p>

  <p class="normal">He measured the niches, revised in his mind the height of the bases on which his figures would stand, sought out the caretaker, a pleasant red-faced man of middle years who greeted him loquaciously.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, you're the Michelangelo Buonarroti we've been waiting for. The St. Francis arrived from Rome weeks ago. I set it up in a cool room off the Baptistery, forge and all. The Cardinal Piccolomini instructed me to take good care of you. Got a room all ready in our house across the square. My wife prepares the best Sienese <i>pappardelle alla lepre, </i>wide noodles with a hare sauce..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo swam into the river of words.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you take me to the St. Francis? I must see how much work there is."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course! Remember, you're Cardinal Piccolomini's guest here, and the cardinal is our great man..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo swallowed hard at the sight of Torrigiani's sculpture: wooden, lifeless, a plethora of flowing robes under which no part of a living, breathing human could be discerned; hands without veins, skin or bone; a rigid, stylized expressionless face... all these points he ticked off to himself as his eyes mercilessly tore through the unfinished block. He vowed to give this poor marred St. Francis, whom even the birds would not recognize, all of the love and skill at his command. He would have to re-enter the block, shed its artificial trappings, throw out the committed marble and redesign the whole figure, recast the concept so that St. Francis might emerge as Michelangelo thought of him, the most gentle of the saints. But he would sleep on it first, then bring drawing materials and sit in this cool room carved out of the cathedral mountain, with diffused light from an overhead window, and search his mind until St. Francis emerged in his love of the poor, the stricken, the abandoned.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next day he made his drawings. By nightfall he was putting new edges on old chisels, balancing them for his hand, getting accustomed to the heft of the hammer. The following dawn he began carving in white heat; and out of the now skinny block there emerged a travel-weary body beneath a slight robe, the emaciated shoulders down to bone, the hands touchingly expressive, the legs thin, knock-kneed, the feet that had trod the roads to give sustenance and to adore everything in nature, tired. He felt an identity with St. Francis, and with this maimed block from which he was emerging. When he came to the head and face he carved his own hair, brushed in a straight line down the forehead, his own caved-in face as he had seen it in the Medici mirror the morning after Torrigiana stove it in: the nose squashed between the eyes, snaking downward in an S, a lump over the eye, the swollen cheekbone below; a St. Francis saddened by what he saw when he looked out at God's world, yet over the painted features a forgiveness, a sweetness and acceptance.</p>

  <p class="normal">A mood of sadness pervaded him as he rode home through the Chianti hills. Wearily he dropped off his horse, made his way to his workshop, saddlebag over his shoulder. He found Argiento wiggling excitedly from one foot to the other, waiting for Michelangelo to look at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Well, Argiento, what are you bursting with?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Gonfaloniere Soderini, he wants to see you, he sends a page every hour!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Piazza della Signoria was aglow with orange light from the burning oil posts that hung from every window and from the top of the crenelated tower. Soderini detached himself from his Council associates in the raised loggia and met Michelangelo at the base of Donatello's Judith. He was dressed in a plain silk shirt against the locked-in heat of the evening, but his expression was one of being coolly pleased with himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why the oil pots? What are we celebrating?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In part." Soderini's eyes twinkled wickedly in the orange light. "The Council agreed this afternoon on a new constitution. That's the official explanation. The unofficial explanation is that the directors of the Wool Guild and the Duomo voted you the Giant..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo went rigid. It was incredible. The Duccio column was his!</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini's voice continued gaily. "When we realized that our best Florentine carver was bound by a Sienese cardinal, we asked, 'Does Siena suppose that Florence does not appreciate its own artists? Or that we can't afford to employ them?' After all, we've spent years at war with the Sienese...!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"But the Piccolomini contract..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Out of patriotic duty you must postpone the Piccolomini contract, and on September first take over the Duccio block."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt the familiar stinging behind his eyelids.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do I thank you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini slowly shook his elongated head with its yellow-streaked hair, murmured, "We are sons of <i>Il Magnifico; </i>we must observe that bond."</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">His feet carried him down the Borgo Pinti into the Via degli Artisti, then out a gate of the wall, along the Affrico River, and up the hills to Settignano. The Topolino family was in the yard enjoying the evening breeze from the hills.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Listen," he called out, "I just heard. The Duccio column. It's mine!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We should be able to trust you now with a few window frames," teased the father.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo spread his hands in front of him. "Thank you for the honor, <i>padre mio, </i>but a good <i>scalpellino </i>likes to shape building block."</p>

  <p class="normal">He remained the night, sleeping on an old straw pad under the arches between the grandfather and youngest son. At dawn he rose to join the men chipping <i>pietra serena. </i>He worked for a few hours, while the sun climbed high in the valley, then went into the house. The mother handed him a jug of cold water.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Madre mia, </span></i><span>how goes it with Contessina?" he asked.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"She is frail.... But it is more. The Signoria has forbidden anyone to help them." She made the eloquent Tuscan gesture of hopelessness, her hands circling outward and down. "The hatred of Piero still poisons."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo drank deeply of the water, went back to the workyard and asked Bruno:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can you spare a few pieces of iron?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is always to spare."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo put wood in the forge, lit it, fashioned a set of small chisels and hammers, the kind the Topolino father had made for him when he was six. Then he cut out an oblong of <i>serena, </i>carved the <i>scalpellino's </i>alphabet on it, from the herringbone to the lines of the dog's-tooth chisel.</p>

  <p class="normal">He bade the Topolinos <i>"Addio." </i>The family knew, by some mystical system of communication, that he had come to them first after learning of his good fortune. His visit here overnight, the companionable work hours on the blocks, told them of his continued love for them.</p>

  <p class="normal">The horse he had borrowed was old and tired. Halfway up the steep trail Michelangelo dismounted and led the animal. At the top of the ridge he turned west as the sun flooded the sky over the Mugnone Valley with rose and purple. It was a short haul into Fiesole, northern anchor of the Etruscan league of cities that began at Veii, just outside Rome, and that Caesar's legions had had a difficult time conquering. Caesar thought he had leveled Fiesole, but as Michelangelo started down the north slope, seeing Poliziano's Villa Diana in the distance, he passed Etruscan walls still cemented and intact, and new houses rebuilt of the original stones of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina's house was at the bottom of a steep, narrow track, halfway down the slope to the Mugnone River. It had formerly been the peasant's house for the castle on top of the hill. Michelangelo tied his horse to an olive tree, made his way through a vegetable garden and looked down at the Ridolfi family on the small stone-paved terrace in front of their cottage. Contessina was sitting on a cane-backed chair, the baby at her breast, a six-year-old playing at her feet. He called softly from the bank above:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is I, Michelangelo Buonarroti, come to visit."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina lifted her head sharply, covered her breast.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo! What a surprise. Come down, come down. The path is over to the right."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a constrained silence as Ridolfi lifted his proud, hurt face. Michelangelo took the <i>serena </i>slab and tools from the saddle bag and made his way down the path. Ridolfi was still looking upward to him, standing stiffly. He set the toy chisels, hammer and slab at Contessina's feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yesterday I received the Duccio column. I had to come to tell you. <i>Il Magnifico </i>would have wanted it. Then I realized that your oldest son must now be six. It is time he started learning; I shall be his teacher. Just as the Topolinos taught me when I was six."</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina's peals of laughter rang out over the fields of olives. Ridolfi's stern mouth twitched with amusement. He said in a low voice, "You are kind to come to us this way. You know that we are pariahs."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was the first time Ridolfi had ever addressed him; and it was the first time Michelangelo had been close to him since the day of Contessina's wedding. Ridolfi was short of thirty, but ostracism and bitterness were already ravaging his face. Though he had not been involved in the conspiracy to bring back Piero de' Medici, he was known to despise the Republic and to be ready to work for the return of an oligarchic control of Florence. His family fortune, based on world trade in wool, was now being used to help finance the city-state.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Which makes it a doubly noxious brew for me to imbibe," said Ridolfi; "but one day we shall be returned to power. Then we shall see!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He felt Contessina's eyes burning into his back. He turned to gaze at her, head on. Her attitude was one of calm acceptance of what was, even though they had just finished a plain dinner, were wearing threadbare clothes, and were housed in a peasant's cottage after having lived in the richest palaces of Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell us the news of yourself. Of the years in Rome. What have you sculptured? I heard about the Bacchus."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo reached into his shirt for a sheet of drawing paper, took charcoal from his belt and sketched the Pietà, explaining what he had tried to accomplish. It was good to be with Contessina again, to gaze into those dark eyes. Had they not loved each other, if only with the love of children? Once you have loved, should not that love last? Love was so rare, so difficult to come upon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Contessina divined his thoughts; she always had. She turned to her son.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Luigi, would you like to learn Michelangelo's alphabet?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can I help carve the new statue, Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will come and teach you, the way Bertoldo taught me in your grandfather's garden. Now, take this hammer in one hand, the chisel in the other. On the opposite side of the stone I will show you how to spell. With a hammer and chisel we can write sculptures as beautiful as Dante's poetry. Is it not so, Contessina?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is so," she replied. "Each of us has his own alphabet with which to make poetry."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was midnight by the time he had returned the Topolino horse and walked down the hill. His father was awake, waiting in the black leather chair. This was apparently his second night of sitting up, and he was thoroughly exasperated.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So! It takes you two nights to come home to your father with the news. Where have you been all this time? Where is the contract? What price are they paying?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Six florins a month."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How long will it take you to carve?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Two years."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico figured rapidly, then turned a ravaged face upward to his son.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But that adds up to only a hundred and forty-four florins."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Board agrees to pay more, when I'm finished, if they think I deserve a larger compensation."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who shall that decision be left to?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Their conscience."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Conscience! Don't you know that a Tuscan's conscience stops short of his belt?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The David will be so beautiful they will want to pay me more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even the Piccolomini contract is better: you earn three hundred and thirty-two florins in the same two years of work, more than double!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo lowered his head in despair. Lodovico did not consult his son's expression. He said in a tone of finality:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Buonarroti are not rich enough to make a charitable contribution of one hundred and eighty-eight florins to the Wool Guild and the Duomo. Tell them that the David will have to be postponed until you have earned the five hundred ducats from Siena."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo knew better than to get angry. He replied quietly, "Father, I am going to carve the David. Why do you always bring up these futile arguments?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Several hours later his brother Buonarroto commented:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not so futile. Before the argument, how many florins a month were you planning to pay Father?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Three. Half for him, half for me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And now you have agreed to give him five."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had to to quiet him down."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So, for a few hours' argument, he has earned himself two extra florins a month for twenty-four months."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sighed wearily.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What can I do? He looks so old and white. Since the Board is paying my costs, what do I need the other two florins for?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Buonarroto groaned. "You were better off as an apprentice in the Medici palace. Then, at least, I was able to put away some savings for you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gazed out the window at the figure of the night guard strolling down the Via San Proculo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're right about Father: I'm his quarry."</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci launched a celebration party built around the meeting of the Company of the Cauldron. To salute Michelangelo's good fortune, eleven members of the Company showed up, Botticelli limping painfully on crutches, and Rosselli, of the rival studio to Ghirlandaio, so ill that he had to be carried in on a litter. Rustici received him heartily, Sansovino pounded him on the back, the others offered congratulations: David Ghirlandaio, Bugiardini, Albertinelli, Filippino Lippi, <i>Il Cronaca, </i>Baccio d'Agnolo, Leonardo da Vinci. The twelfth member, Giuliano da Sangallo, was away.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci had been provisioning Rustici's studio all afternoon with chains of sausages, cold beef and suckling pig, figures carved out of pastry, demijohns of Chianti. When Granacci approached Soggi with the news, he contributed an enormous basin of pickled pigs' feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">The food and drink was all needed, for Granacci had invited the town: the entire Ghirlandaio studio, including Domenico's talented son, Ridolfo, now eighteen; all of the Medici garden apprentices; a dozen of the better-known sculptors and painters including Donate Benti, Benedetto da Rovezzano, Piero di Cosimo, Lorenzo di Credi, Franciabigio, the young Andrea del Sarto, Andrea della Robbia, the maker of glazed terra cottas, the leading Florentine craftsmen, goldsmiths, clockmakers, gem cutters, bronze casters; the mosaicist Monte di Giovanni di Miniato; the illuminator Attavanti; wood carvers; the architect Francesco Filarete who was chief herald of Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Wise in the ways of the Republic, Granacci had also sent invitations to Gonfaloniere Soderini, the members of the Signoria, the Boards of the Wool Guild and the Duomo, to the Strozzi family to whom he had sold the Hercules. Most of them came, happy to join in the fun, for the huge assemblage now spilled out of Rustici's jammed, noisy studio into the square, where Granacci's hired band of acrobats and wrestlers were entertaining, and musicians and minstrels were chanting songs for the young men and girls dancing in the square. Everyone wrung Michelangelo's hand, pounded him on the back and insisted upon drinking a toast with him, friend, casual acquaintance and stranger alike.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini shook Michelangelo's hand, said, "This is the first major commission agreed upon by all of the city Boards since the coming of Savonarola. Perhaps a new era will start for us, and we can wipe out our deep-lying sense of guilt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Which guilt are you referring to, Gonfaloniere?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The mass guilt, the individual guilt. We have suffered bad times since the death of <i>Il Magnifico; </i>we have destroyed much that made Florence the first city of the world. The bribing of Caesar Borgia was only the latest in nine years of indignities. But tonight we like ourselves. Later, perhaps, we will be proud of you, when the marble is finished. But now it is ourselves we are proud of. We believe that great commissions for frescoes, for mosaics, for bronzes and marbles will be forthcoming for all our artists. We are seeing a rebirth." He laid a hand on Michelangelo's shoulder. "You happen to be the midwife. Handle the baby well!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The party lasted until dawn; but before that, two incidents occurred which would affect the pattern of his days.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first filled him with joy. The ill and aged Rosselli gathered the ten members of the Company about him, announced:</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is not meat and drink, if you will forgive a pun, for a member of this Company of the Cauldron to be carried to these orgies on a litter. Therefore, much as I dislike promoting anyone from the Ghirlandaio studio, I herewith resign from the Company and nominate Michelangelo Buonarroti to succeed me."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was accepted. He had been no part of any group since the Medici sculpture garden. He remembered again his lonely childhood, how difficult it had been for him to make friends, to be gay. He had been skinny, unsociable, unwanted. Now all these artists of Florence, even those who had long waited to be invited into the Company, were applauding his election.</p>

  <p class="normal">The second incident was to cause him considerable anguish. It was begun, though unwittingly, by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was already angry at Leonardo by the first time he had seen him crossing the Piazza della Signoria, accompanied by his inseparable and beloved apprentice-companion, Salai, a boy with features straight off a Greek statue, a mass of curly hair waving around his head, with a small round mouth and soft round chin, dressed by Leonardo in an expensive linen shirt, a cloak rich in silver brocade. Yet compared to Leonardo, Salai was dull in appearance; for Leonardo's was the most perfect face to appear in Florence since the golden beauty of Pico della Mirandola. He carried his big sculptural head thrown back aristocratically, the magnificently broad forehead topped by a haze of reddish hair, softly curled and worn down to his shoulders; a chin carved out of the heroic Carrara statuary marble he despised; a flawlessly designed broad nose, rounded, full-blooded lips, the face dominated by cool blue eyes of a piercing penetration and intelligence; and the fair complexion of a country girl.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo's figure, as Michelangelo watched him cross the square followed by his usual retinue of servants and hangers-on, matched the flawless face: tall, graceful, with the broad shoulders and narrow hips of a wrestler, with the agility and strength as well, dressed in regal splendor and a disdain for convention: a rose-colored cloak barely covering his shoulders, and falling short at the knees, wearing his shirt and <i>calze </i>tight to the point of bursting.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had made Michelangelo feel ugly and malformed, conscious that his clothes were inexpensive, ill fitting and worn. Leonardo's coiffured golden hair and scent of perfume, the lace about his neck and wrists, the jewels, the ineffable exquisiteness of the man's presence made him feel tattered and dirty by comparison.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he had spoken of this to Rustici, who was Leonardo's friend, Rustici had reproved him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't be fooled by an elegant exterior. Leonardo has a magnificent brain. His studies of geometry are extending the work of Euclid. He has been dissecting animals for years, and keeping meticulous notebooks of his anatomical drawings. In his pursuit of geology he has discovered fish-shell fossils on top of the mountains of the upper Arao, proving that they were once under water. He is also an engineer and inventor of unbelievable machines: a multiple-barrel gun, cranes for lifting heavy loads, suction pumps, wind and water gauges. Even now he is completing experiments for a machine that will fly through the air as the birds do. The dazzling performance of imitating a rich nobleman is his effort to persuade the world to forget that he is the illegitimate son of a Vinci innkeeper's daughter. Actually he is the only man in Florence who works as hard and long as you do: twenty hours a day. Look for the real Leonardo beneath that defensive elegance."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the face of this brilliant recital, Michelangelo could not bring himself to mention his anger at the man's outspoken deprecation of sculpture. Leonardo's hearty welcoming of him into the Company of the Cauldron this evening had also assuaged his uneasiness. Then he heard Leonardo's high-pitched voice behind him, declaring:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I refused to compete for the Duccio block because sculpture is a mechanical art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Surely you would not call Donatello a mechanic?" asked a deeper voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">"In some ways, yes," answered Leonardo. "Sculpture is so much less intellectual than painting; it lacks so many of its natural aspects. I spent years at it, and I tell you from experience that painting is far more difficult, and reaches the greater perfection."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Still, for a commission as important as that...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, no, I would never carve marble. It causes a man to sweat and wearies his body all over. The marble carver comes out of a day's work as filthy as a plasterer or baker, his nostrils clogged with dust, his hair and face and legs covered with powder and chips, his clothes stinking. When I paint I work in my finest clothes. I emerge at the end of a day immaculately clean and refreshed. Friends come in to read poetry to me, and play music while I draw. I am a fastidious man. Sculpture is for laborers."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt his spine stiffen. He glanced over his shoulder. Leonardo's back was to him. Again a rage rose in his bowels. He yearned to spin Leonardo around, smash him in his beautiful face with the sculptor's fist he held in such contempt. Then quickly he moved to the other end of the room, hurt not only for himself but for all marble carvers. One day he would make Leonardo eat those words.</p>

  <p class="normal">The following morning he awoke late. The Arno was down to a trickle. He had to go miles upstream to find a deep pool. Here he bathed and swam, then walked back, stopping at Santo Spirito. He found Prior Bichiellini in the library. The prior heard his news without expression.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And the Cardinal Piccolomini contract?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"When the two Boards sign this commission, I will be free of the other."</p>

  <p class="normal">"By what right? What you have begun, finish!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"But the Giant is my great opportunity. I can create something glorious..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"After you fulfill your obligation," interrupted Bichiellini. "This is a worse variety of opportunism than led you to sign a contract you detested." His voice became more friendly. "I understand that you do not want to give your energies to figures which are unsatisfying to you. But you knew that to begin with. You may also be surrendering your integrity for no gain. Cardinal Piccolomini may be our next Pope, and then the Signoria will order you back to the Siena pieces just as they obeyed Alexander VI and put Savonarola on the rack."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everyone has the next Pope!" said Michelangelo caustically. "Giuliano da Sangallo says it will be his Cardinal Rovere. Leo Baglioni says it will be his Cardinal Riario. Now you say it will be Cardinal Piccolomini..."</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior rose, abruptly left Michelangelo's side, made his way to the open archway overlooking the piazza. Michelangelo hurried after him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Forgive me, Father, but I've got to carve my David now."</p>

  <p class="normal">The prior made his way across the corner of the piazza, leaving Michelangelo standing flat-footed in the merciless glare of the August sun.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe gave him a raucous welcome. "So you own the Duccio block for free!" He grinned, scratching his bald scalp.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Beppe, like it or not, you've got me under your wing for two full years."</p>

  <p class="normal">The foreman groaned. "As though I don't have troubles enough keeping the cathedral from falling down. But the Board of Works say give him everything he wants: marble, chisels, pretty girls..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo laughed aloud, bringing the artisans running. They welcomed him to the yard.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Duomo workyard ran the full width of the block behind the Duomo Works buildings from the Via dei Servi on the north side to the Street of the Clock on the south, bound in by an eight-foot brick wall. The front half, where the Duccio column had lain, was the quarters for the artisans maintaining the cathedral; the rear half was used for storage of lumber, brick, paving stone. Michelangelo wanted to be close to the workmen so he could hear the sound of their tools and voices, yet not be involved. In the center of the rear yard there was an oak tree, and behind it, in the wall admitting to a nameless passage, an iron gate, locked, rusted. The gate was exactly two blocks from his house. He could work nights when he wished, and holidays when the main yard would be locked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Beppe, is it permitted to use this gate?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nobody forbids. I locked it myself, ten, twelve years ago, when tools and material were missing."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would it be all right if I used it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What's wrong with the front entrance?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing. But if we could build my workshop around this gate, I could come and go without bothering anybody."</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe chewed toothlessly on this idea to make sure Michelangelo was not repudiating him or his crew. Then he said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do it. Draw me plans."</p>

  <p class="normal">He needed thirty feet along the back wall to be paved for his forge and tools, and for keeping his wood dry; the brick wall would have to be raised another nine feet so that no one could see the column or watch him working on it when he mounted his scaffold. On each side, for a distance of about twenty feet, he wanted low plank walls, but the work area would be open to the sky for the nine dry months of the year, and at the front as well. The Giant would be bathed in the full sunlight of the southern arc as the brilliant Tuscan sun made its daily transit across the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">He decided to keep the workshop in the piazza; it would be a place to go to when he wanted to get away from the large marble. Argiento would sleep there, and work with him here during the day.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Duccio block was so seriously gouged in the center of its seventeen-foot length that any attempt to move it in its present state could prove fatal; a jarring motion or lurching impact would split the column in two. He bought several of the largest pieces of paper he could find, pasted them over the face of the horizontal column and cut out a <i>sagoma, </i>a silhouette, taking care to measure the deep cut accurately. He then took the sheets to the workshop in the piazza and had Argiento nail them up on the wall. He moved his workbench around to face the paper silhouette, began fitting together a second series of sheets on which to draw a design of the David, indicating which parts of the existing block would be discarded, which parts used. Back at the yard, he chipped out marble from the top and bottom corners, balancing the weight so that the column would no longer be in danger of cracking.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe's workmen established a smooth path to the new work area. They used a block and tackle to raise the two-thousand-pound column and get rollers under it. The column was moved slowly; as each rounded beam fell out the back end, a workman ran ahead to reinsert it under the front end. By nightfall the column, though still in a horizontal position, was inside Michelangelo's enclosure. He and his Giant-David block were alone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, for the first time, he realized that the drawings that had satisfied the Boards were no longer of any use to him. He had outgrown these elementary stages of his thinking. All he knew for sure was that his was to be the David he had rediscovered, that he would use the opportunity to create all of the poetry, the beauty, the mystery and the inherent drama of the male body, the archetype and essence of correlated forms.</p>

  <p class="normal">He burned his earlier drawings, settled down to the simplest beginning, probing within himself.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Greeks had carved bodies from their white marble of such perfect proportion and strength that they could never be surpassed; but the figures had been without mind or spirit. His David would be the incarnation of everything Lorenzo de' Medici had been fighting for, that the Plato Academy had believed was the rightful heritage of man: not a sinful little creature living only for salvation in the next life, but a glorious creation capable of beauty, strength, courage, wisdom, faith in his own kind, with a brain and will and inner power to fashion a world filled with the fruit of man's creative intellect. His David would be Apollo, but considerably more; Hercules, but considerably more; Adam, but considerably more; the most fully realized man the world had yet seen, functioning in a rational and humane world.</p>

  <p class="normal">How to draw these convictions on paper?</p>

  <p class="normal">During the early weeks of autumn he achieved only fragmentary answers. The more he was frustrated the more complicated he made his drawings. The marble lay silent and inert.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Maybe nobody can bring it to life?" suggested Beppe, when Michelangelo seemed depressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fine time to tell me! Like asking a girl does she want to be a mother after she's in the family way. Beppe, I'm going to have to model in marble instead of clay. Could you buy me a piece, about a third as large as this one?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I dunno. They said give workmen, material. But a five-foot block, that's money."</p>

  <p class="normal">He delivered, as always, a fair enough block. Michelangelo plunged into the marble, trying to rough his way through his problem with hammer and chisel. What emerged was a strongly built, primitive young man, the face idealized and indeterminate. Granacci, seeing the marble, said with a puzzled expression:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't understand. He stands with his foot resting on Goliath's head; but at the same time he's got a rock in one hand and is reaching over his shoulder for his slingshot. You're of two minds: the upper half is about to use the slingshot, the bottom half is already resting triumphantly on its victim."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You flatter me. I have no mind at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then why not spend a couple of days with me at the villa?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked up sharply; it was the first time Granacci had acknowledged that he had a villa.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will be diverted; you'll forget your David for a couple of days."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Agreed. I can't remember smiling for weeks."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have something at the villa that will bring a smile."</p>

  <p class="normal">He did indeed: a girl by the name of Vermiglia, blond in the Florentine tradition, with her hair plucked back to give her a higher brow, her breasts propped up in a gown of green taffeta. She proved a charming mistress of the villa, presiding over their late candlelit supper on a porch overlooking the Arno as it wound its way to the sea. When she had gone inside, Granacci said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vermiglia has a wide variety of cousins. Would you like her to choose one for you? I think she's lonely here. You could have a suite overlooking the city. It would be a pleasant way of life for us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, <i>caro. </i>I have a way of life. As for casual encounters, Beppe says, 'What you put into the ladies at night, you can't put into the marble in the morning.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat by his window, sleepless, watching the towers and domes of Florence under a scimitar of moon, rising to pace through the series of three small rooms, then going back to his vigil by the window. Why had he carved two Davids into his five-foot block, one already triumphant over Goliath, the other just preparing to hurl the stone? No piece of sculpture could stand at two different moments in the realm of time, any more than it could occupy two different areas in the realm of space. He would have to take a stand, decide which of the two warriors he was going to sculpture.</p>

  <p class="normal">By dawn he had worked his way back, step by step. Sharp light flooded his mind. Goliath had to go. His head, black, dead, blood-spotted, ugly, had no place in the realm of art. It should never have been included in the first place. The full meaning of David was obscured by having that horrendous head forever chained to his ankles. What David had done became a mere physical act ending in the slaying of an opponent. Yet to him this was only a small part of the meaning of David, who could represent the daring of man in every phase of life: thinker, scholar, poet, artist, scientist, statesman, explorer: a giant of the mind, the intellect, the spirit as well as the body. Without the reminder of Goliath's head, he might stand as the symbol of man's courage and his victory over far more important enemies.</p>

  <p class="normal">David had to stand alone. Even as he had stood on the plains of the Valley of the Terebinth.</p>

  <p class="normal">This decision left him exalted... and exhausted. He climbed between Granacci's fine linen sheets, fell into a deep sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sat in his shed before the column, drawing David's head, face and eyes, asking himself:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is David feeling at this moment of conquest? Glory? Gratification? Would he feel himself to be the biggest and strongest man in the world? Would there be a touch of contempt for Goliath, of arrogance as he watched the fleeing Philistines, and then turned to accept the plaudits of the Israelites?"</p>

  <p class="normal">All unworthy emotions, none of which he could bring himself to draw. What could he find in David triumphant, he asked himself, worthy of sculpturing? Tradition portrayed him after the fact. Yet David after the battle was certainly an anticlimax, his great moment already gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">Which then was the important David? When did David become a giant? After killing Goliath? Or at the moment he decided that he must try? David as he was releasing, with brilliant and deadly accuracy, the shot from the sling? Or David before he entered the battle, when he decided that the Israelites must be freed from their vassalage to the Philistines? Was not the decision more important than the act itself, since character was more critical than action? For him, then, it was David's decision that made him a giant, not his killing of Goliath. He had been floundering because he had imprisoned himself and David at the wrong moment in time.</p>

  <p class="normal">How could he have been so stupid, so blind? David pictured after Goliath could be no one but the biblical David, a special individual. He was not content to portray one man; he was seeking universal man, Everyman, all of whom, from the beginning of time, had faced a decision to strike for freedom.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the David he had been seeking, caught at the exultant height of resolution, still reflecting the emotions of fear, hesitation, repugnance, doubt; the man who wished to follow his own ways among the hills of Jerusalem, who cared little for the clash of arms and material reward. The man who killed Goliath would be committed all his life to warfare and its consequence, power. The reluctance would still be fading from his face, this giving up of the pastoral life in which he had been happy for a life of courts and kings, of jealousy and intrigue, of control and disposition of other men's destinies. This was the dichotomy in all men: the reflective life and the active. David would know that the man who gave himself to action would have sold himself to an inexorable master who would command him all the days and years of his life; he would know intuitively that nothing gained as reward for action, no kingdom or power or wealth, could compensate a man for the loss of his privacy.</p>

  <p class="normal">To act was to join. David would not be sure he wanted to join. He had been a man alone. Once he tackled Goliath there would be no turning back, far more true if he vanquished Goliath than if he were vanquished. It was what he sensed that he would do to himself, as well as what the world would do to him, that made him doubtful and averse to changing the pattern of his days. His had been a hard choice, indeed.</p>

  <p class="normal">This concept opened wide vistas to Michelangelo. He soared, he drew with authority and power; he modeled in clay, eighteen inches high, his fingers unable to keep pace with his thoughts and emotions; and with astonishing facility he knew where the David lay. The limitations of the block began to appear as assets, forcing his mind into a simplicity of design that might never have occurred to him had it been whole and perfect. The marble came alive now.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he tired of drawing or modeling he would join his fellow members of the Cauldron for an evening of talk. Sansovino moved into the Duomo workyard to begin carving a marble St. John Baptizing Christ for over the east door of the Baptistery, setting up his workshed between Michelangelo and Beppe's stonemasons. When Rustici became bored with working alone on his drawings for a Boccaccio head and an Annunciation in marble, he would come to the yard and sketch with Michelangelo or Sansovino. Next Baccio joined them in the Duomo workyard, to design a crucifix which he hoped the church of San Lorenzo was going to commission. Bugiardini would bring in a hot dinner in pots from a nearby <i>osteria, </i>and the former apprentices would spend a companionable hour, Argiento serving the food on Michelangelo's plank worktable against the rear wall. Soggi, proud of his former associates, visited once in a while, wheeling in a cart of cooked sausages for the communal dinner.</p>

  <p class="normal">Every now and then he would climb the hill to Fiesole to give Luigi a lesson on <i>pietra serena, </i>which the six-year-old seemed to enjoy. He was a bright-faced, handsome child, resembling his uncle Giuliano, with Contessina's alert mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are wonderful with Luigi, Michelangelo," remarked Contessina. "Giuliano loved you too. Sometime you must have your own son."</p>

  <p class="normal">He shook his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Like most artists, I am a mendicant. When I finish one commission I must go in search of the next, work in whatever city it takes me to: Rome, Naples, Milan, or even Portugal, as Sansovino did. That is no life for a family."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It goes deeper than that," said Contessina in her small, sure voice. "Marble is your marriage. The Bacchus, Pietà, David are your children." They stood close, as close as they sometimes had in the Medici palace. "While you are in Florence, Luigi will be as your son. The Medici need friends. And so do artists."</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Piccolomini sent a representative to Florence who demanded to see the statues for the Bregno altar. Michelangelo showed the agent the completed St. Peter and St. Paul, and the roughed-out figures of the Popes, promising to finish them soon. The next day Baccio came into the shed, his once again mischievous face wreathed in smiles. He had received the commission for the crucifix. Since San Lorenzo had no work space for him, he asked Michelangelo if he might share the shop in the piazza.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Instead of paying rent, I could finish the two Popes from your drawings," he exclaimed. "What do you say?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He did the pieces credibly. With four figures and the St. Francis completed, Michelangelo felt he would have a respite from Cardinal Piccolomini. When Baccio began carving his crucifix, Michelangelo was glad he had taken him in; the work was honest and full of feeling.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento swept out the shop each evening when he returned from the Duomo. He too was content in Florence, working in the Duomo workshed all day, at night having the company of the other young apprentices of the piazza who also slept in their shops, each providing food for a common cookpot.</p>

  <p class="normal">Best of all, Giuliano da Sangallo returned from Savona where he had completed a palace for Cardinal Rovere at the family estate. Leaving Savona, Sangallo had been intercepted and kept a prisoner for six months by the Pisans and had had to be ransomed for three hundred ducats. Michelangelo visited with him at the family home in the Quarter of the Sun, near Santa Maria Novella. He still insisted that Cardinal Rovere would be the next Pope.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell me about your design for the Giant," he demanded. "And what have you heard of interesting architectural jobs in Florence?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are several of great urgency," said Michelangelo. "A revolving table strong enough to turn a two-thousand-pound column of marble, so I can control the light and sun. A fifteen-foot scaffold, one in which I can change the height and work all around the block."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo was amused. "You are my best client. Let's get pen and paper. What you need is a series of four towers, with open shelves that take planks from either direction, like this.... As for your turntable, that's an engineering task...."</p>

  <p class="chapter">8.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were heavy rain clouds overhead. Beppe and his crew built a wooden roof that arched upward at a sharp angle from the back wall, leaving space for the seventeen-foot column, then tiled it securely to keep out the rain.</p>

  <p class="normal">His marble was still lying flat on the ground. He made a wooden lid to fit its length, with lead-weighted strings hanging over the sides to show at what level in the block he would be seeking for the back of David's head, the arm raised to take the slingshot, the hips swiveled away from the gouge, the rock inside the huge right hand, the tree trunk supporting the right calf. He marked these depths with charcoal and then, helped by Beppe's augmented crew of fifteen, roped the column, attached a block and tackle, slowly raised it to stand upright on Sangallo's turntable. He and Argiento then built the scaffold towers that had open shelves to take wide planks at any height he needed to work.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the column cried out to him, giving itself wholly. His tools tore into its flesh with a terrifying penetration, searching for elbows and thighs and chest and groin and kneecap. The white crystals that had lain dormant for half a century yielded lovingly to every touch, from the subtlest nuance to the driving "Go!" in which his hammer and chisel swept upward from the ankle through the knee and thigh without stopping, the routine count of seven for work, followed by four of rest, abandoned as he felt within himself the strength of a hundred men.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was his most glorious experience in working marble; never had he had such an expanse of figure, such a simplicity of design; never before had he been so possessed by a sense of precision, force, penetration or depth of passion. He could think of nothing else now, could not bring himself to stop for food or change of clothes. He fed his marble hunger twenty hours a day, the acrid dust coagulating in his nostrils, his hair covered as white as old Ficino's, the vibrations of the marble consistency running from the chisels and hammer up his shoulders, then down his chest into his loins and thighs and knees, throbbing and vibrating through his body and brain long after he had thrown himself across his bed in exultant exhaustion. When his right hand tired of driving the hammer he shifted it to the left, the chisel in his right moving with the same precision and probing sensitivity. He carved at night by candlelight, in absolute quiet, for Argiento retired at sundown to the other shop. To Sangallo, who sometimes walked over after supper to check the turntable and scaffold, he commented:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd like to carve for a year of days and nights, with no break at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's midnight, and freezing in this shed. Aren't you cold?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flashed his friend a mischievous grin, the amber eyes shining as a cat's do at night.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Cold? I'm burning with fever. Look how the tension of the torso is beginning to emerge. Another few days and life will break through."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had met the challenge of the deeply gouged area by tilting the figure twenty degrees inside the column, designing it diagonally, on the bias, down the thickness of the marble, so that David's left side could be fitted into the remaining marble. Now it was as an engineer that he buried in his design a strong vertical structure beginning at the right foot, continuing up through the right leg supported by the short tree trunk, through the thigh and torso and the width of the giant neck, face and head. With this shaft of solid marble his David would stand erect; there could never be an inner collapse.</p>

  <p class="normal">The key to the beauty and balance of the composition was David's right hand enclosing the stone. This was the form from which the rest of David's anatomy and feeling grew; as the key to the Bacchus had been the arm raised high to hold the wine cup, the Virgin's face the key to the Pietà. This hand with its bulging veins created a width and a bulk to compensate for the leanness with which he had had to carve the straight left hip opposite, even as the right arm and elbow would be the most delicate form in the composition.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he became increasingly absorbed, Granacci could no longer persuade him to come to the villa for supper; he went rarely to the meetings at Rustici's, and then only if the night were too wet and raw to continue work. He could hardly concentrate on what was being said, let alone contribute anything to his friends. Leonardo da Vinci was the only one who complained, claiming that Michelangelo had no right to come to them in his filthy clothes and dust-matted hair. From the pained expression on Leonardo's face, the slight sniffing of the patrician nostrils, he saw that Leonardo thought he smelled bad. He imagined that he probably did, for he did not take his clothes off for a week at a time, even to sleep; but he was too involved to care. Easier to stop going to the Company of the Cauldron.</p>

  <p class="normal">Christmas came, he accompanied his family to high mass at Santa Croce. The New Year he ignored, not even going to the celebration at Rustici's to help the Company usher in 1502. He stormed through the dark days of January, Argiento feeding coal to four braziers so that he would be warm enough to work, turning the table to catch the most light, moving the plank-platform up and down the David, forward and back as he worked the four sides simultaneously, keeping a heavy webbing between the legs and between the arms and the bulk of the body. The neck was so tremendous he could work it without fear of the head breaking off. He left considerable marble about the heroic head so that later he could carve a shock of short wavy hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini came into the yard to observe progress. He knew that Michelangelo would have no peace at home until a price was set on the finished David. Toward the middle of February, after Michelangelo had been working for five months, he asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you feel you have moved far enough along now for the Boards to see the work? I can have them meet here, and arrange a final contract..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked up at the David. His study of anatomy had strongly influenced his carving; in this early stage his chisel had roughed out the muscle movements of the calves, the thighs, the chest, pulling the inner action to the surface of the skin. He pointed out to Soderini how a muscle structure consists of fibers that run in a parallel direction; all action that took place in the David ran along these parallel fibrous lines. Then, reluctantly, he turned back to Soderini's question.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No artist likes to have his work seen in this crude state."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Boards might pay considerably more if you could wait until it is finished...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't," sighed Michelangelo. "No extra amount of money could compensate me for two more years of my father's misery."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Two more years? Even with the figure emerging as well as it is?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is the work that goes fastest."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll bring the members as soon as we meet on a sunny day."</p>

  <p class="normal">The rains vanished. The sun came out, clear and warm, to dry the stones of the city. Michelangelo and Argiento took the tiles off the roof and stacked them against the next winter, then removed the planks and let the full light bathe the shed. The David pulsated with life in every fiber of its body, beautiful bluish-gray veinings running up the legs like human veins, the considerable weight already firmly carried on the right leg.</p>

  <p class="normal">Word arrived from Soderini that he would bring the members of the Boards at noon the following day. Michelangelo exclaimed, "Argiento, start cleaning! This must be two months of marble chips I'm walking on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't blame me," cried Argiento, "you won't keep out of here long enough to let me sweep. I think you like to wade through them, ankle deep."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're right, I do. But there'll be enough distraction for the Board members."</p>

  <p class="normal">How much should he tell the men who were coming to pass judgment? If this concept of the David had taken him months of painful intellectual search, he could not expect to justify his departures from Florentine tradition in one short hour. Might not the men think of what his tongue was saying instead of what his hand had carved?</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento had everything scrubbed and orderly in the workshed. Soderini, with sixteen men, arrived just as Giotto's Campanile bells began to chime. Michelangelo greeted them warmly, remembering the names of Michelozzo, chancellor of the Wool Art Guild, Consuls Pandolfini and Giovanni di Pagno degli Albizi, Paolo de' Carnesecchi of the Board of Works, the notary of the Board, Bambelli, a number of others. The older men were still guarding against the cold by wearing full dark cloaks fastened at the neck and reaching their square-toed, thonged shoes, but the younger and more venturesome were saluting spring in particolored stockings patterned with the family blazon, and shirts with slashed sleeves.</p>

  <p class="normal">They crowded around the half-born David, gazing up ten feet in the air with awe. Chancellor Michelozzo asked if Michelangelo would demonstrate to them how he worked the marble. He picked up his hammer and chisel, showed them how the back of his chisel sank into the hammer just as it sank into the marble, creating no explosion, but rather a gentle insinuative force. He indicated that the abrupt termination of each chisel passage caused a slight chipping as the tool was lifted, therefore the longer the "Go!" the fewer chippings.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had them circle the David, pointed out its vertical structural strength, how the arms would be released from the protective webbing which ran at an angle into the torso, the tree trunk which would be the only object to support the giant nude. The figure was still tilted twenty per cent in the upright block, but he demonstrated how, as he discarded the negative marble now surrounding it, the David would stand head on.</p>

  <p class="normal">The next afternoon Soderini came into the Duomo yard with an official-looking document in his hand, clapped Michelangelo on the back.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Boards were pleased. Shall I read? The Honorable Lord Consuls of the Wool Art Guild decided that the Board of Works of the Duomo can give the sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti four hundred large golden florins in payment of the Giant called David existing in the Opera and that Michelangelo shall complete the work to perfection within two years from today.'"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now I can forget about money until I have finished. That is paradise for an artist."</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited until Lodovico brought up the subject the next time. "The reward has been fixed, Father: four hundred large gold florins."</p>

  <p class="normal">Lodovico's eyes sparkled, lighting his hollow cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Four hundred florins! Excellent! Plus six florins a month for as long as you work..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Surely they're adding the florins you've earned each month? They're not so niggardly as to take those back?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I continue to receive six florins a month for two more years...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, good." Lodovico picked up his pen. "Let's see, twenty-four times six equals one hundred and forty-four, added to four hundred, equals five hundred and forty-four florins, a much better price."</p>

  <p class="normal">Bleakly, Michelangelo replied, "No. Just four hundred florins. In toto. All the florins paid by the month are in advance. They will be deducted at the end."</p>

  <p class="normal">The pleasure went out of Lodovico's expression as he saw himself losing one hundred and forty-four florins.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's not right," he muttered, "first they give you money, then they take it away."</p>

  <p class="normal">And Michelangelo knew how it would be: Lodovico would go around with a wounded expression, as though someone had taken advantage of him. He had not earned his peace, after all. Perhaps there was no such thing as peace.</p>

  <p class="chapter">9.</p>

  <p class="normal">To mark the frontal projections, David's left foot, left knee, right wrist, the left elbow and hand at the shoulder, he affixed nailheads in the marble. With these fixed points established he was able to carve the upsurging line from the knee through the thigh and chest, delineating David's hard physical stamina; the flesh of the belly in which David was feeling quiverings of anxiety; the left hand holding the slingshot, the great right hand standing cocked, rock at the ready. To protect himself he had left half again as much marble at the rear as he would ultimately need, keeping in mind the fact that there were forty views of a statue as one walked around it.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had designed David as an independent man, standing clear of all space around him. The statue must never be fitted into a niche, stood against a wall, used to decorate a façade or soften the harsh corner of a building. David must always be free. The world was a battlefield, man forever under strain, precarious on his perch. David was a fighter; not a brutal, senseless ravager, but capable of achieving freedom.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the figure became aggressive, began to push out of its mass, striving to define itself in space. His own pace matched the drive of the material, so that Sangallo and Sansovino, visiting with him of a Sunday afternoon, were staggered by his passion.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've never seen anything like it," cried Sangallo. "He's knocked off more chips from this hard marble in the last quarter of an hour than any three of his stonecutter friends in the quarry could cut in four."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's not the quantity that frightens me," added Sansovino, "it's the impetuosity. I've been watching fragments get hurled four feet in the air, until I thought the whole marble would fly to pieces."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo," cried Sangallo. "You've been shaving the line so closely that if you had overpassed it by a hairs-breadth, you risked losing all!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stopped work, turned and faced his friends.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Once marble is out of its quarry, it is no longer a mountain, it is a river. It can flow, change its course. That's what I'm doing, helping this marble river change its bed."</p>

  <p class="normal">When the others had returned to their homes, Michelangelo sat at the David's feet and gazed up at him. He thought, "It takes as long for a marble column to bear, as it does a fruit tree." Yet each separate form within the sculpture was beginning to mirror the time and love he had lavished on it. Nor was he frightened by Sansovino's warning, for he identified himself with the center of gravity of the block, fitting himself into the core, feeling the balancing weight of the arms, legs, torso, head, as though they were his own. When he sliced off marble he did so with the precise knowledge of how much flesh he could safely spare.</p>

  <p class="normal">The one thorn in this flesh, his own and the David's, was Leonardo da Vinci's belittling of the sculptor's art. To Michelangelo it appeared a serious threat. Leonardo's influence in Florence was spreading; if it should convince enough people that marble carving was a second-rate craft, when his David was completed it would be received with indifference. Growing within him was a need to counterattack.</p>

  <p class="normal">The following Sunday when the Company of the Cauldron was meeting at Rustici's, and Leonardo made light of stone carving, Michelangelo said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"True, sculpture shares nothing with painting. It exists on its own premises. But primitive man carved in stone for thousands of years before he began to paint on cave walls. Sculpture is the first and original art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"By that very claim it is condemned," answered Leonardo in his high-pitched voice. "It satisfied only until the fine art of painting was developed. It is now becoming extinct."</p>

  <p class="normal">Infuriated, Michelangelo struck back with a personal attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Isn't it true, Leonardo," he demanded, "that your equestrian statue in Milan is so colossal that it can never be cast? And hence will never come into existence as bronze sculpture? And that your huge clay model is disintegrating so fast that it's becoming the joke of Milan? No wonder you talk against sculpture, you're not capable of bringing a piece to completion!"</p>

  <p class="normal">There was an uncomfortable silence in the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few days later Florence learned that, despite its payments to Caesar Borgia, he was marching on Urbino and helping to incite a rebellion in Arezzo against Florentine rule. Leonardo da Vinci joined Caesar Borgia's army as an engineer, to work alongside Torrigiani and Piero de' Medici. Michelangelo was outraged.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He's a traitor," he cried angrily to Rustici, who was taking care of Leonardo's possessions while he was gone. "Caesar Borgia offers him a big salary, and so he will help conquer Florence. After we gave him hospitality, commissions to paint important pictures..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It really isn't that bad," said Rustici placatingly. "Leonardo is at loose ends, he can't seem to finish his painting of Monna Lisa del Giocondo. He's more interested in his new war machines than in art. He saw in Caesar Borgia's offer a chance to test out a lot of his inventions. He doesn't understand politics, you know."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell that to the Florentines," replied Michelangelo acidly, "if his new machines batter down the walls."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're justified in feeling as you do, Michelangelo, but try to remember that he is amoral. He is not interested in right and wrong as it applies to people; only in the true and false in science and knowledge."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I suppose I ought to be glad to be rid of him. He fled once before, for eighteen years. I hope we can count on as long this time."</p>

  <p class="normal">Rustici shook his head wistfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You two stand like the Apennines above the rest of us, yet you hate each other. It doesn't make sense. Or does it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The cycle of the seasons brought gloriously hot weather. Occasional showers did nothing to the David but wash the marble dust off him. Michelangelo worked stripped to his drawers and sandals, letting the sun beat down on his body and pour its strength into him. He scampered up and down the ladder as lightly as a cat, working the stout neck, heroic head and mass of curls from the top of the scaffold, carving the spine with great care to indicate that it carried and directed the whole body and was the mainspring of all movement. There could be no part of the David that was not palpable, and perfect. He had never understood why the erogenous zone had been represented as unbeautiful. If God made man as the Bible said he had made Adam, would he have made the area of procreation something to hide, something vile? Perhaps man had perverted the uses thereof, as he had managed to pervert so much else on earth; but what did that have to do with his statue? That which had been despised, he would make godlike.</p>

  <p class="normal">He kept no track of time. He carved all day. Late of a stifling evening he might sit on the cool marble steps of the Duomo, where the young artists of Florence still gathered, to listen to improvised songs on guitars, exchange news of coming commissions throughout Tuscany, and listen to Jacopo discuss which of the passing girls were mattressable... even as he had fourteen years before. In June, Piero Soderini was elected to another two months as Gonfaloniere. People were beginning to ask why, since he was the best man in Tuscany for the job, he could not be allowed to govern longer.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo learned that Contessina was going to have another baby, he went to Soderini's office overlooking the Piazza della Signoria, to plead her cause.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why can she not return to her home for the birth of her child? She has committed no crime against the Republic. She was <i>Il Magnifico's </i>daughter before she was Ridolfi's wife. Her life is being endangered by this isolation in a cottage where there are no facilities..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The country people have managed to have their babies in those houses for a thousand years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Contessina is not country people. She's frail. She wasn't raised this way. Couldn't you plead to the Council of Seventy for justice?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is impossible." Soderini's voice was flat, expressionless. "The kindest thing you can do is not bring up the Ridolfi name."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was in the middle of Soderini's two-month term, with Arezzo and Pisa again in revolt, Piero de' Medici welcomed in Arezzo and promised help in conquering Florence, Caesar Borgia kept from attacking only through fear of French retaliation, and the city's gates kept locked during the day, with "all who lived along the river forbidden to lower ladders, to prevent anyone entering the town," that Michelangelo received a message to have supper with the Gonfaloniere at the Palazzo della Signoria. There was good work light until seven, after which he returned home to put on a linen shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini was sitting before a low table, his long yellow-white hair still wet from washing. They exchanged news on the state of the David, Soderini told that the Council of Seventy was about to change the constitution. The next man elected Gonfaloniere would have a lifetime position. Then he leaned across the table in a relaxed, confiding manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, you have heard of Pierre de Rohan, the Maréchal de Gié? He was here in the 1494 invasion with Charles VIII, as one of his closest advisers. You may also recall that in the Medici courtyard Donatello's bronze David had the place of honor."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The day the palace was sacked I was knocked into it so hard I had a lump on the back of my head."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you know it well. Now, our ambassador to the French court has written that the Maréchal fell in love with the David while staying at the Medici palace, and would like to have one. For years we have been buying France's protection with money. Isn't it gratifying that for once we can pay for it with a work of art?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked at this man who had become such a good friend to him. It would be impossible to deny him. Instead he asked, "I am not to copy the Donatello?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let's say that it would be safe to create minor variations, but not enough to disappoint the Maréchal's memory."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo put a slice of cheese on a quartered pear.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've never had a chance to do anything for Florence. It gives me a good feeling. If only I had not been an idiot, and refused to learn casting from Bertoldo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have good casters in Florence: Bonaccorso Ghiberti, the cannon maker, and Lodovico Lotti, the bell caster."</p>

  <p class="normal">The sensation of being a patriot faded when he again stood in front of Donatello's David in the courtyard of the Signoria. He had come so far from this conception in his own figure! If he could not bring himself to copy it, and at the same time could not change it... ?</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to the courtyard in the morning, carrying a box to sit on, and sheets of old drawing paper. His David emerged several years older than Donatello's, more male and muscular, drawn with the inner tensions that can be transplanted to marble, few of which were present in the smooth-surfaced bronze youth before him. He set up an armature on the back bench in the workshed, used his occasional rest hours to transpose his drawings into a rough clay structure, slowly building up a nude with a turban binding up the hair. He was amused to think that, in the interests of Florence, he had to model a head of Goliath, on which David rested his foot in triumph. The Maréchal would never be happy without that head.</p>

  <p class="normal">The perfect weather lasted through November first, when Soderini was installed as Gonfaloniere for life in a colorful pageant on the Signoria steps, with all of Florence in the piazza, and Michelangelo up front, feeling proud and secure. Then freezing winter clamped down. Michelangelo and Argiento put up the roof, reset the tiles. The four braziers could not cut the intense cold. He wore his cap with the earmuffs. Beppe hung a canvas over the side opening, but there was little light from the overcast skies and the canvas cut out that little. Now he suffered from darkness as well as cold. He worked by candlelight and lamp. Nor was spring much help; heavy rains began in early March and lasted for months.</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward the end of April he received an invitation to dinner in the new apartment of the Signoria, presided over by Monna Argentina Soderini, the first woman ever permitted to live in the palace. The suite had been decorated by Giuliano de Sangallo and young Baccio d'Agnolo, the living, dining and bed rooms converted from first- and second-floor offices formerly used by the city notary and chancellor. The dining room was frescoed, the ceiling done in gilt, the cupboards and buffet of inlaid woods. The dinner table was laid before a fire, warm and cheerful. Michelangelo took off his green cloak, pleased with his appearance in his smocked woolen shirt. Soderini showed off his wife's flower pots in the windows.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know some people are complaining about the expense of the window boxes," he said shyly; "but actually I think it's their way of saying that women shouldn't live in the Palazzo della Signoria."</p>

  <p class="normal">After dinner Soderini asked Michelangelo to accompany him to the Duomo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"For years Florence has been talking of having the Twelve Apostles in marble for the cathedral. Larger than life size. Of perfect Seravezza marble. That would fill the cavernous space, would it not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"With the light of a thousand candles."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini stopped at the back of the central altar, facing the Donatello and Della Robbia marble choirs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been speaking to the members of the Boards. They think it a magnificent idea."</p>

  <p class="normal">Numbly, Michelangelo murmured, "It's a lifetime of work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So were Ghiberti's doors."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's what Bertoldo wanted for me: a body of work."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini linked his arm through Michelangelo's, walked him down the long nave toward the open door.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It would make you the official sculptor of Florence. The contract I have been discussing with the Boards includes a house we will build for you, and a studio of your own design."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A home of my own! And a studio."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought that would please you. You could do one Apostle a year. As each was delivered, you would own another twelfth of your house and studio."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stopped in the doorway. He turned about to look at the enormous and empty cathedral. Assuredly it could use the Twelve Apostles.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tomorrow is the monthly meeting of the joint Boards. They have asked you to appear."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's smile was sickly. He made his way, cold and shivering, through the streets toward the hills, glad that he had worn a warm cloak. When he began to climb to Settignano he perspired as heavily as though he had a fever. He could not concentrate his thoughts on any one aspect of Soderini's proposed commission. Then, as he reached the Settignano farmhouse, pride took precedence: he was only twenty-eight, and he was going to have a home of his own, and a sculpture studio adequate to carve heroic pieces. He stood on the terrace in the midst of the five Topolino men, began slicing <i>pietra serena </i>blocks into long slabs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Better tell us," said the father, "before you burst."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am now a man of substance."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What kind of substance?" asked Bruno.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall have a house."</p>

  <p class="normal">He told them about the Twelve Apostles. The father brought out a bottle of old wine, reserved for marriages and births of sons. They drank a glass to his good fortune.</p>

  <p class="normal">His anxieties rushed upward to drown out the pride. He descended the hill, jumped stones to cross the creek, climbed the opposite side to stand for a moment gazing at the house and rooms in which he remembered his mother. How proud she would be, how happy for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then why was he not happy for himself? Was it because he did not want to carve the Twelve Apostles? Because he hesitated to lock himself into a commission that would consume the next twelve years of his life? Once again be obliged to handle fully clothed and draped figures? He did not know whether he could endure it, after the glorious freedom of the David. Even Donatello had done only one or two apostles in marble. How was he going to create something fresh and different for each of the twelve?</p>

  <p class="normal">His feet carried him to Giuliano da Sangallo, where he found his friend at his drafting table. Sangallo already knew about the proposal; Soderini had asked him and <i>Il Cronaca </i>to appear at the meeting the following afternoon to witness the signing of the contract. <i>Il Cronaca </i>was to design the house.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sangallo, this project isn't anything I conceived for myself. Should a sculptor undertake a twelve-year task unless he's passionately eager to do it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo replied noncommittally, "It's a lot of years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As long as a sculptor lives from one commission to another he remains someone who is hired."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Painting and sculpture have always been commissioned. Is there an alternative?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To create art works independently, sell them to whoever will buy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Unheard of."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But not impossible?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...perhaps not. But can you turn down the Gonfaloniere and the Boards? They are offering you the biggest commission since Ghiberti's doors. The members would be offended. That would put you in a difficult position."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat with his head in his hands, glum.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know. I can't take it, and I can't turn it down."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo brought a hand down sharply on Michelangelo's shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Take the contract, build your house and studio, carve as many Apostles as you can do well. When you're through, you're through; you'll pay off the rest of the house in cash."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Another Piccolomini contract," said Michelangelo mournfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">He signed the contract. The news spread through the city with the speed of a fresh scandal. Strangers bowed to him respectfully in the Via de' Gori. He nodded back, wondering what they would think if they could know how miserable he was. He reached home to find the Buonarroti in the family room, excitedly planning their new house. Uncle Francesco and Aunt Cassandra decided they wanted a third floor to themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Get it built quickly," said his father. "The faster we move in, the sooner we stop paying rent here."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned away to gaze sightlessly into the street. He spoke without emotion.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This is to be my home. And my workshop. It is not to be the family residence."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a stunned silence. Then his father, uncle and aunt all began talking at once, so that he could not disentangle the voices.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can you say such a thing? Your home is our home. We can save rent. Who will cook and clean..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He knew better than to say, "I am now twenty-eight, and it is time I had my own house. I have earned it." Instead he replied, "The land is provided, but I am allowed only six hundred florins for building purposes. I need a huge studio to handle these marbles, with a thirty-foot roof, and a large outdoor paved court. There will be enough left for a small house, one bedroom, two at the most..."</p>

  <p class="normal">The storm lasted the rest of the day, until everyone was worn out. Michelangelo was adamant; the least he could get out of the contract was private work quarters, a secluded island to live in. But he had to agree to pay the rent for this apartment out of his monthly advances.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he had a clay model of the Marshal's David he sent Argiento to Lodovico Lotti, the bell caster, and Bonaccorso Ghiberti, the cannon caster. The two artisans came from their foundries in clothes streaked with grime. The Gonfaloniere had requested them to help Michelangelo get the bronze ready. When they saw Michelangelo's model they looked at each other, Lotti wiping black soot from the back of his hand across his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It won't cast," he declared.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because you got to make a plaster mold," said Ghiberti.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I know nothing of this confounded art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We can only cast what another man makes," replied Lotti.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sought help from Rustici, Sansovino, Bugiardini, to see if they had listened more closely to Bertoldo about bronze. From them he learned that he would have to make his clay statue full size and exact, then build over it with plaster, piece by piece, marking on every piece a numerical key for identification, oil the pieces where the edges had to be connected, set the plaster cast aside...</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Basta!" </span></i><span>groaned Michelangelo. "No wonder I never learned."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The casters brought him back his David. He gazed dully at the ugly red bronze figure, streaked, bumpy, ridged, with protuberances of metal where it was not wanted. He was going to need punches, files, chasing tools to make it look human; then burnishers, metal chisels, polishers, pumice and oil to make it presentable. Even then, would the Maréchal's memory so fail him as to imagine this David resembled Donatello's? He doubted it.</p>

  <p class="chapter">10.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first fruit of his contract for the Twelve Apostles was a visit from a neighbor he had known in the Piazza Santa Croce, Agnolo Doni, his own age, whose father had made a beginning competence in the wool trade and bought a neglected palace near the Albertini palace in the Santa Croce quarter. Agnolo Doni had taken over his father's business and palace, earned the reputation of being the sharpest bargainer in Tuscany, made a fortune and remodeled the palace. He had come so high in the financial and social worlds of Florence that he was now engaged to Maddalena Strozzi.</p>

  <p class="normal">Beppe brought Doni into the workshed with an apologetic expression. Michelangelo was high on the scaffold carving on the sling over David's left shoulder. He laid down his tools, climbed down the ladder. Doni was wearing an expensive doublet, from which a shirt puffed out at the shoulders, fastened at the breast and waist with golden clasps.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll come straight to the point, Buonarroti," he said as Michelangelo reached the ground. "I want you to do a Holy Family as a wedding present for my bride-to-be, Maddalena Strozzi."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flushed with pleasure; Maddalena had been brought up with his Hercules.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Strozzi have good taste in the arts," he murmured. "A Holy Family in white marble..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni's small mouth, framed between the vertical creases on either side, fell visibly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, no, it is I who have the good taste! I thought of commissioning you, not Maddalena. And who said anything about marble? That would cost a lot of money. All I want is a painting, to be used as an inset in a round table."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo picked up his hammer and chisel.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why should you come to me for a painting? I haven't put color on a brush for fifteen years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pure loyalty. We are of the same quarter. Remember how we used to play football in the Piazza Santa Croce?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo smiled ironically. Doni pressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you say? A Holy Family. Thirty florins. Ten for each figure. That's a generous sum, isn't it? Shall we call it a bargain?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know how much the painters will charge you, Doni, but you can have your choice of half a dozen of the best in Italy: Granacci, Filippino Lippi. What about Ghirlandaio's son, Ridolfo? He's going to be a fine craftsman, and he'll do it cheap."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Look, Buonarroti. I want you to paint a Holy Family. I don't want one by Lippi or young Ghirlandaio. I already have Gonfaloniere Soderini's permission."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But, Doni, it makes no sense. You don't take your wool to a scissors maker to be woven..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is well known that to carve marble is to be only a fraction of an artist."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Enough," growled Michelangelo, furious at this repetition of Leonardo's denunciation, "I'll paint your Holy Family. For one hundred gold florins."</p>

  <p class="normal">"One hundred!" screamed Doni, so that he could be heard the length of the Duomo workyard. "How can you cheat one of your oldest friends? The playmate of your youth. It's like stealing the purse off your brother's belt."</p>

  <p class="normal">They compromised on seventy florins; but not until Michelangelo's eardrums felt broken. By the crafty smile in Doni's shrewd eyes, Michelangelo perceived that Doni had outwitted, or at least outshouted, him and would have paid the hundred florins. From the door Doni said not unkindly, "You were the worst <i>calcio </i>player in the neighborhood. That puzzles me: how could you be so bad at football and so good at sculpture? But you certainly are the artist of the moment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's why you want me, because I'm fashionable?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What better reason could there be? When will I see the sketches?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The sketches are my business. The finished product is yours."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You agreed to let Cardinal Piccolomini see your drawings."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Get yourself appointed a cardinal."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Doni had left, Michelangelo realized that he had been an idiot to let the man goad him into taking the commission. What did he know about painting? Or care? He could design a Holy Family, the drawing would be fun. But paint and color! Young Ridolfo could handle these better than he.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet his interest was piqued. He had dozens of drawings for a Madonna and Child that he had made for the merchants from Bruges, should the Mouscrons sign Jacopo Galli's contract. They were intensely spiritual, removed from the mundane world. For a Holy Family the concept should be the opposite in spirit: earthy, a family of simple people.</p>

  <p class="normal">As always during the hot summer days when he permitted himself a rest, he tramped the roads of Tuscany, sketching the farmers in the fields, eating before their door in the cool of evening, the young country mothers nursing their young before putting them to sleep in cribs under the outdoor arches. Over the days he drew for the Doni portrait a strong-limbed, healthy young girl from one household, a plump, red-cheeked curly-haired child from another, a bald-headed bearded grandfather from a third, put them together in an affectionate grouping on the grass. The flesh tones of the arms, faces, feet, the naked <i>bambino </i>he had no trouble with, but the robes of the mother and Joseph, the blanket of the child, eluded him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci dropped by, amused at Michelangelo's bafflement.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you like me to fill in the colors? You're making such an awful mess."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why didn't Doni honor you with the commission in the first place? You are of the Santa Croce quarter. You played football with him too!"</p>

  <p class="normal">In the end he did a series of monotones, as though they were colored marble. The mother's dress he painted pale rose and blue, the child's blanket light to burnt orange, Joseph showing only a shoulder and arm of faded blue. In the foreground he painted a few simple bunches of flowers growing in the grass. The background was bare, except for the impish face of John looking upward. To amuse himself he painted a sea on one side of the family, mountains on the other; before the sea and the mountains he drew in five nude youths, sitting on a wall, glorious bronze figures with the sun on them, creating the effect of a Greek frieze.</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni's face went the color of his red tunic when he answered Michelangelo's summons to see the finished picture.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Show me one thing that is holy about the picture of peasants! One sentiment that is religious! You're mocking me!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would I be such a fool as to throw away my work on a mockery? These are fine people, tender in their love of the child."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I want a Holy Family in a palace."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness has nothing to do with surroundings. It's an inner spiritual quality."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I cannot give this picnic on the grass to my delicate bride. I would lose cast with the Strozzi family. You have put me in the worst imaginable light."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Might I remind you that you did not reserve the right of rejection?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni's eyes narrowed to slits, then flew open at the same time as his mouth as he cried in horror:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What are those five naked boys doing in my Holy Family?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why, they've just come out from a swim in the sea," replied Michelangelo calmly, "and are drying themselves in the sun."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You've been touched by the moon," screamed Doni. "Whoever heard of five naked youths forming a background for a Christian picture?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Think of them as figures on a frieze. This gives you both a Christian painting and a Greek sculpture, at no extra charge. Remember your original offer was thirty florins, ten for each figure. If I wanted to be greedy I could charge you fifty florins extra for the five youths. But I won't, because we are of the same quarter."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll take the picture to Leonardo da Vinci," growled Doni, "and have those five obscene idlers painted out!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Until now Michelangelo had been amused. Now he cried, "I'll sue you for defacing a work of art!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm paying for it, and I can deface it all I want."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Remember Savonarola! I'll haul you before the Council."</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni groaned, stormed out. The next day his servant arrived with a pouch of thirty-five florins, half the price agreed upon, and a release for Michelangelo to sign. Michelangelo sent Argiento back with the pouch. On a scrap of paper he scrawled:</p>

  <p class="block2indent">The Holy Family will now cost you one hundred and forty florins.</p>

  <p class="normal">Florence enjoyed the contest, with bets on who would win. Michelangelo found himself on the short end of the odds because no one had ever bested Doni in a deal. However, the time was growing short to Doni's wedding day, and he had bragged all over town that he was having Florence's official artist paint a wedding gift for his bride. Doni arrived at the Duomo workshed with a leather purse containing seventy florins, crying:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Here's your money, give me my painting."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Doni, that wouldn't be fair. You hate the picture, and I release you from your agreement."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't try to outwit me. I'll go to Gonfaloniere Soderini and have him force you to fulfill your contract."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't know you loved the painting that much. Now I believe that you're a great art collector. Just hand over the hundred and forty florins..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're a swindler! You agreed to paint the picture for seventy..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...an agreement you threw open to renegotiation by offering me thirty-five florins. My price is now one hundred and forty."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never," screamed Doni, "for that mediocre peasant picture. I'll see you hanged from the Bargello first."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo decided he had had his fun, was about to send the painting to Doni when a barefooted <i>contadino </i>boy brought him a note which read:</p>

  <p class="block2indent">I hear that Maddalena wants your painting. She has said no wedding present will please her more. C.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had immediately recognized the handwriting. He knew that Maddalena Strozzi had been Contessina's friend; he was happy to realize that some of her old friends had remained in touch with her. He chuckled, sat down at his workbench, and wrote a note which he sent to Doni:</p>

  <p class="block2indent">I fully appreciate how expensive my painting must seem to you. As an old and dear friend, I will release you from any financial embarrassment by giving the Holy Family to another friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni came running on Argiento's heels; flung down a pouch with a clang loud enough to be heard above all the stone chipping in the yard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I demand the painting! It is now mine by legal right."</p>

  <p class="normal">He picked up the leather bag, untied the thong and poured the hundred and forty gold pieces onto the worktable. "Count them! One hundred and forty pieces of gold! For a miserable peasant family sitting on the grass. Why I let you exploit me this way is beyond my comprehension!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo picked up the painting, handed it to Doni.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My compliments to your wife-to-be."</p>

  <p class="normal">Doni made his way to the door, grumbling, "Artists! Supposed to be impractical. Ha! You'd bankrupt the shrewdest merchant in Tuscany!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gathered up the coins. He had enjoyed the whole affair. It was as refreshing as a vacation.</p>

  <p class="chapter">11.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was considerable rejoicing in August when the Borgia Pope, Alexander VI, died. When Cardinal Piccolomini of Siena was elected to the papacy, Giuliano da Sangallo was crushed, Michelangelo was apprehensive. He had done no further work on the Piccolomini statues, not even a line of drawing. One word from the new Pope, and Gonfaloniere Soderini would be obliged to take him off the David until the remaining eleven figures were completed and delivered.</p>

  <p class="normal">He refused to allow anyone into the workshed for a month as he worked frenziedly, before the Vatican ax could fall. Most of David's body was realized, only the face and head remained. For the first time he realized the weight of the contract for the Twelve Apostles, which would also hang over his head for years. He wanted to throw himself into the Arno.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Piccolomini lasted as Pope Pius III for one month, dying suddenly in Rome. This time Giuliano da Sangallo proved to be the prognosticator: Cardinal Rovere was elected Pope Julius II. There was an uproarious celebration at the Sangallos', where Giuliano told everyone he was taking Michelangelo to Rome with him to create great marble sculptures.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo da Vinci returned from Caesar Borgia's army, was given the keys to the Great Hall of the Signoria in anticipation of being awarded a commission to create a fresco for the wall just behind the platform on which Gonfaloniere Soderini and the Signoria sat. The payment was to be ten thousand florins!</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was livid. This was the largest and most important painting commission given by Florence in decades. Ten thousand florins to Leonardo for a fresco which was to be completed in two years. Four hundred florins to him for the Giant-David! For the same amount of work! Given to a man who would have helped Caesar Borgia conquer Florence! Leonardo was to be paid twenty-five times as much as the city was paying him. By that very fact, he had again struck a mortal blow against sculpture.</p>

  <p class="normal">He ran in his rage to Soderini's office. Soderini heard him out; it was part of his talent to let his people have their say. He also allowed a few moments of silence for Michelangelo to hear his angry words echoing off the walls before answering in the quietest possible voice.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo da Vinci is a great painter. I have seen the Last Supper in Milan. It is tremendous. No one in all Italy can equal him. I am frankly covetous of Milan's fresco, and I am anxious that he paint one for Florence. If it is as fine, it will enrich us enormously."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had been reproved and dismissed, all in the same breath.</p>

  <p class="normal">There began the final months of work, so highly pleasurable to him now that the two years of labor were coming into focus. He went to David's face, carved it tenderly, with all the love and sympathy in his being: the strong, noble face of the youth who would, in one more moment, make the leap into manhood, but at this instant was still sad and uncertain over what he must do; the brows deeply knit, the eyes questioning, the full lips expectant. The set of the features had to be of a whole with the body. The expression on David's face must communicate that evil was vulnerable, even though it wore armor weighing a thousand pounds. There would always be some spot in it which was undefended; and if the good in man were dominant it would find that exposed area and evolve a way to penetrate it. The emotion must convey the idea that his conflict with Goliath was a parable of good and evil.</p>

  <p class="normal">The head was to have a feeling of illumination about it, coming not only from within but from the aura around it. To achieve this, he left volume about David's lips, jaws, nostrils. For the eyes and nostrils he used an auger; for the eyebrows a small chisel. For the deep penetration in the ear holes and between the teeth he drilled with a small-size bit, then larger bits as the openings grew larger. Between the strands of hair he made a series of penetrations, the holes following one another, orderly, controlled, using a long thin needle, holding it between both palms, rotating it, exerting only the slightest pressure of the hands. He took the most exquisite pains with the skin creases on the forehead, the tense slightly drawn-in nostrils, the slightly parted lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the last of the webbing slowly cut away, he began to polish. He did not want as high a sheen as he had achieved for the Pietà. What he wanted was the outward expression of blood, muscle, brain, vein, bone, tissue; true, convincing, lifelike, in beautiful proportion: David in the warm palpitant human flesh, with a mind and a spirit and a soul shining through; a David quivering with emotion, the cords in his neck pulled taut by the head turned hard to Goliath, yet withal knowing that to live is to act.</p>

  <p class="normal">In early January of 1504 Florence learned that Piero de' Medici had acted for the last time. Fighting with the French army, because he hoped to secure help from Louis XII against Florence, Piero had drowned in the Garigliano River when a boat in which he was saving four pieces of artillery from the Spanish army overturned. A member of the Signoria exclaimed publicly, "We Florentines are much rejoiced to hear that news!" Michelangelo had a moment of sadness, then pity for Alfonsina and her children; he remembered Lorenzo on his deathbed, telling Piero how to rule Florence. Then he was conscious that Piero's death meant that Contessina was nearer to being released from her exile.</p>

  <p class="normal">At the end of January, Soderini called a meeting of artists and artisans of Florence to decide where the Giant-David should be placed. Michelangelo was summoned to the Signoria and shown the list of people invited to the discussion. He saw that the painters included Botticelli, Rosselli, David Ghirlandaio, Leonardo da Vinci, Filippino Lippi, Piero di Cosimo, Granacci, Perugino, Lorenzo di Credi. The sculptors were Rustici, Sansovino and Betto Buglioni, the architects Giuliano and his brother Antonio da Sangallo, <i>Il Cronaca, </i>Baccio d'Agnolo. There were four goldsmiths, two jewelers, an embroiderer, a terra-cotta designer, an illuminator; two carpenters on their way to becoming architects, the cannon caster Ghiberti; the clockmaker Lorenzo della Golpaia.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Can you think of anyone left out?" asked Soderini.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't think you should be included. The others might be constrained in speaking."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd like to express my opinion."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You already have," replied Soderini dryly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The meeting was called for the following day in the upstairs library of the Duomo headquarters, before the supper hour. Michelangelo had not meant to hover, but there were windows in the library facing the workyard, and he heard the hubbub of many voices above him as the artists collected. He walked through the yard, climbed a back stair to a small adjoining vestibule. Someone rapped for order, silence fell. Michelangelo recognized the voice of Francesco Filarete, herald of the Signoria.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have turned over in my mind those suggestions which my judgment could afford me. You have two places where the statue might be set up: the first, where the Donatello Judith stands; the second, in the middle of the courtyard where the bronze David is. The first might be selected because the Judith is an omen of evil and no fit object where it stands; besides, it is not proper that the woman should kill the male; and above all, this statue was erected under an evil constellation, since we have gone continually from bad to worse since then. The David is imperfect in the right leg; and so I should counsel you to put the Giant in one of these places, but I give the preference myself to that of the Judith."</p>

  <p class="normal">That suited Michelangelo fine. Another voice started speaking, one he did not recognize. He peeked into the library, saw that the speaker was Monciatto, the woodcarver.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I say that the Giant was meant to be put on the pillars outside the Duomo, or spurs around the church. I do not know why it should not be put there, and it seems to me that it would look fine and as a suitable ornament to the church of Santa Maria del Fiore."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo watched Rosselli rise feebly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Both Messer Francesco Filarete and Messer Francesco Monciatto spoke all right. However, I had originally thought that the Giant should be placed on the stairs of the Duomo, to the right side, and, according to my opinion, this would be the best place."</p>

  <p class="normal">Other opinions came fast. Gallieno, the embroiderer, thought it should be placed where the Marzocco, the Lion, stood, in the piazza, with which David Ghirlandaio agreed; several, including Leonardo da Vinci, chose the loggia because the marble would be protected. <i>Il Cronaca </i>suggested the Great Hall, where Leonardo's fresco was to be painted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo muttered, "Isn't there one artist here who will say I should have the right to select the spot myself?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Then Filippino Lippi said, "I think that everyone said wise things, but I am sure that the sculptor will propose the best place, as he certainly has considered longer and with more authority the spot where the Giant should be placed."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a murmur of agreement. Angelo Manfidi concluded:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Before your magnificent lords decide where the statue ought to be placed, I suggest that you ask the advice of the Signori among whom there are some high intellects."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo closed the door noiselessly and went down the back stairs to the yard. Gonfaloniere Soderini would now be able to guide the Giant-David to the spot Michelangelo wanted: in front of the Palazzo Signoria where the Judith now stood.</p>

  <p class="normal">Crusty Pollaiuolo, <i>Il Cronaca, </i>as supervising architect of the Duomo, was in charge of moving the David; but he appeared grateful for the offer of Antonio da Sangallo, as well as Giuliano, to design a carrier. Baccio d'Agnolo, the architect, volunteered his services, as did Chimente del Tasso and Bernardo della Cecca, the two young carpenter-architects, since they were interested in the problem of moving the largest marble sculpture ever to be carried through the streets of Florence. The statue must be anchored securely so that it would not topple, yet not so rigidly that a jolt, jar or sudden movement could damage it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The David will have to be carried upright," said Giuliano. "The framework in which it is being transported must be moved so that the marble feels no motion."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The solution?" replied Antonio. "A carrier within a carrier. We won't fasten him down; we'll put him in a sling, inside a big wooden frame; then he'll sway gently back and forth with the movement."</p>

  <p class="normal">The two carpenter-architects built a twenty-foot cage of wood to the Sangallos' specifications, open at the top. Antonio devised a series of slip knots which ran easily on the ropes, becoming tighter under weight, loosening as the pressure slacked. The David was encased in a net of enormous ropes, lifted by grapples, moved inside the open cage, suspended and held in its web. The wall behind the workshed was ripped out, the cage raised onto round rollers, the road-bed made smooth. The statue was ready for its mile-long journey through the Florentine streets.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>Il Cronaca </span></i><span>hired forty men to drag the huge crate on its round logs, using windlasses turned by a bar. As the heavy frame inched its way forward the rear log was released, picked up by a workman who ran forward to put it under the front of the framework. David, secured at the crotch and upward along Michelangelo's columnar structure over the strong chest, swayed only along the distance of the slip knots.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">In spite of the forty workmen, the statue was moved but a few feet an hour. By nightfall they had gotten it out of the wall, down the Street of the Clock to the corner, maneuvered the sharp turn into the Via del Proconsolo, with hundreds of people watching the procession, and then only half a block down the street before darkness settled.</p>

  <p class="normal">Everyone cried their "Good night. Until tomorrow." Michelangelo went home. He paced the bedroom, trying to pass the hours. At midnight, uneasy, he left the house to return to the David. There it stood, gleaming white in the moonlight, unfettered in its roped-in security, still facing toward Goliath, the hand reaching for the sling, the profile chiseled and polished to flawless beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">He threw a blanket inside the cage, in the space behind the David where the right calf joined the tree trunk. There was room for him to lie on the wooden floor. He had fallen into a state halfway from wakefulness when he heard running feet, the sound of voices, then stones hitting the side wall of the frame. He sprang up, cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Guards!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He heard the running feet go down the Proconsolo, gave chase, calling at the top of his lungs:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stop! Night guards! Stop them!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The half dozen fleeing forms seemed to be young boys. His heart pounding wildly, he returned to the David, found two guards standing there with lanterns.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What's all the noise?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The statue was being stoned."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Stoned? By whom?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Did they hit it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't think so. I heard only the sound on wood."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're sure you weren't having a bad dream?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I tell you I saw them. And heard them. If I hadn't been here..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He circled the David, peering through the darkness, wondering who would want to injure it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vandals," said Soderini, arriving early to watch the moving process resume. "But I'll put a guard out tonight."</p>

  <p class="normal">The vandals came back, a dozen strong, after midnight. He heard them while they were still sneaking up the Street of St. Proculus, shouted a warning which made them unload their barrage of stones too soon. The next morning all of Florence knew that there was a movement to damage the David. Soderini summoned him to a meeting of the Signoria to ask who the attackers might be.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you have enemies?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"None that I know of."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We should rather ask, 'Does Florence have enemies?'" said Herald Filarete. "Just let them try it tonight."</p>

  <p class="normal">They did, at the bottom corner of the Piazza della Signoria, where Piazza San Firenze joined the big square. But Soderini had concealed armed guards in doorways and yards surrounding the David. Eight of the gang were captured and taken to the Bargello. Michelangelo, half dead from lack of sleep, scanned the list of names. There was not one he recognized.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning the upper hall of the Bargello was jammed with Florentines. Michelangelo gazed at the culprits. Five were young, perhaps fifteen years old; they testified that they had merely joined in the adventure proposed by their older friends, and did not know what they were stoning. Their families were fined, the boys released.</p>

  <p class="normal">The other three were older, resentful and vindictive in mood. The first said he had stoned the David because it was obscenely naked, that Savonarola would have wanted it destroyed. The second said that it was bad art, and he wanted to show that some people knew better. The third claimed that he was acting for a friend who wanted the David broken; but he would not mention the friend's name.</p>

  <p class="normal">All three were sentenced to the Stinche by the judge, who quoted a Tuscan adage, "Art has an enemy called ignorance."</p>

  <p class="normal">That evening, the fourth day of its journey, the David arrived at its destination. D'Agnolo and the young carpenters knocked down the cage. The Sangallos unslipped the knots, removed the rope mantle. The Judith was carried away, David installed in her place at the foot of the palace steps facing the open piazza.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo drew in his breath sharply as he came into the piazza. He had not seen the David at such a distance. There it stood in all its majestic grace, lighting up the Signoria with pure white light. He stood below the figure, feeling insignificant, weak and homely, powerless now that the statue was out of his hands, asking himself, "How much of what I wanted to say have I managed to convey?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He had stood guard for four nights, was only half conscious from exhaustion. Should he keep guard again tonight? Now that the David was completely exposed, at anyone's mercy? A few large stones, well directed, could tear off its arm, even the head. Granacci said firmly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Things happen while something is in transit that stop when it takes its permanent place."</p>

  <p class="normal">He guided Michelangelo home, took off his boots, helped him into bed and put a blanket over him. To Lodovico who was watching from the door, he said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let him sleep. Even if the sun goes twice around."</p>

  <p class="normal">He woke feeling refreshed, and ravishingly hungry. Though it was not time for dinner he ate his way through pots of soup, <i>lasagne </i>and boiled fish that were supposed to feed the family. His stomach was so full he could hardly crowd himself into the wooden tub for a bath. He enjoyed the fresh white linen shirt, stockings and sandals, the first he could remember in weeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned off the Piazza San Firenze into the lower end of the Signoria. A crowd was standing below the David in silence. Fluttering from the statue were pieces of paper stuck to the marble during the night. He had seen this sight in Rome, when people had pasted up verses derogatory to the Borgia on the library door of the Vatican, or affixed their smoldering complaints to the marble torso of the Pasquino statue near the Piazza Navona.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked across the square, through the crowd. It fell back to let him pass. He tried to read their expressions, to see what was in the wind. They seemed big-eyed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He came to the David, climbed up on the base, began taking off the papers, reading them one by one. By the end of the third, his eyes began to mist: for they were messages of love and acceptance:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>You have given us back our self-respect.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>We are proud to be Florentines.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>How magnificent is man!</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Never can they tell me man is vile; he</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>is the proudest creature on earth.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>You have made a thing of beauty.</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>&#160;</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Bravo!</i></p>

  <p class="normal">His eye caught a familiar paper, of a kind he had held in his hands before. He reached for it, read:</p>

  <p class="versi"><i>Everything my father hoped to accomplish</i></p>

  <p class="versi"><i>for Florence is expressed in your David.</i></p>

  <p class="block2"><i>Contessina Ridolfi de' Medici</i></p>

  <p class="normal">She had made her way into the city at night, past the guards. She had taken the risk to come and see his David, had joined her voice to that of Florence's.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned, stood above the crowd gazing up at him. There was silence in the square. And yet he had never felt such complete communication. It was as though they read each other's thoughts, as though they were one and the same: they were a part of him, every Florentine standing below, eyes turned up to him, and he was a part of them.</p>

  <p class="chapter">12.</p>

  <p class="normal">A letter arrived from Jacopo Galli enclosing a contract signed by the Mouscron brothers, who agreed to pay him four thousand guldens, and saying, "You are free to do any Madonna and Child you can conceive. Now, after sweet meat, comes sour sauce. The Piccolomini heirs insist that you carve the balance of their statues. I prevailed upon them to extend the contract for another two years; that was the best I could do."</p>

  <p class="normal">A two-year extension! He quickly dispatched the pieces to the back of his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">An immediate repercussion of the David was a call at the Buonarroti apartment by Bartolommeo Pitti, from the secondary branch of the wealthy Pitti who lived in a stone palace on the opposite side of the Arno. Bartolommeo was a shy and retiring man whose modest house on the Piazza Santo Spirito had a draper's shop on the ground floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am just beginning an art collection. So far I have three small paintings on wood, lovely, but not important. My wife and I would give anything if we could help a work of art to be born."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was taken by the man's simple manner, the mild brown eyes shining beneath the bald crown.</p>

  <p class="normal">"In what way would you like to participate, <i>messere?"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"We wondered if there were some small piece of marble you might have had in mind, or would take pleasure in thinking about, for us...."</p>

  <p class="normal">He took his very first sculpture off the wall, the Madonna and Child relief he had carved under Bertoldo's guidance. "For a long time, Messer Pitti, I have perceived how much I failed in this first bas-relief, and why. I should like to try again, but in the circular, tondo shape. I think I could bring whole figures out of bas-relief, create the impression of sculpture in the round. Would you like me to try this for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Pitti wet his dry, ridged lips with his tongue. "I cannot convey how much happiness that would bring us."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo escorted Bartolommeo Pitti down the stairs to the street.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Something good will emerge for you, I feel it in my bones."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Signoria passed a resolution urging <i>Il Cronaca </i>to get Michelangelo's house and studio built. Pollaiuolo had allowed the drawings to become lost under a pile of bric-a-brac on his cluttered desk that always contained a couple of dozen hard-boiled eggs, the only food he ate.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Suppose I set up the structure and the room space?" he asked Michelangelo. "I imagine you will want to design the stone blocks?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I should like that. Could I make a few stipulations?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What client doesn't?" growled <i>Il Cronaca.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd like the kitchen upstairs, between the family room and my bedroom. A fireplace with the chimney built into the wall. A pillared loggia outside my bedroom, overlooking the back yard. Brick floors, good windows, a second-story latrine. A front door with a cornice over it of thin hewn stone. All ulterior walls plastered. I'll paint them myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't see what you need me for," grumbled <i>Il Cronaca. </i>"Let's go over to the land and place the studio for light and sun."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo asked if the Topolinos could do the stonework.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Providing you guarantee the work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will get the most beautifully carved blocks ever hewed in Settignano."</p>

  <p class="normal">The open lot was on the corner of the Borgo Pinti and the Via della Colonna, forty-six feet on the Borgo adjoining the Cestello monastery, the Via della Colonna side considerably longer, ending at the shop of a blacksmith and carpenter. They bought some pegs from him, paced off the land and drove in the boundary stakes.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>Il Cronaca </span></i><span>returned in a couple of weeks with the plans for the house and adjoining studio, uncompromisingly square on the outside but designed for comfort within. There was an open loggia off the second-story bedroom where Michelangelo would eat and rest in warm weather.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">The Topolinos were soon cutting <i>pietra serena </i>according to his specifications, the stones emerging a luminous blue-gray, with marvelous grainings. They cut the blocks for his fireplace, using the strings he brought them for length, the thin hewn stones for the cornice; and when the building blocks were ready the entire family built the house. <i>Il Cronaca </i>brought in the plasterers for the interior walls, the tilemakers to put on the roof, but at night Michelangelo could not resist going to the house to quench the lime with water from the well that had been dug in the yard, to temper the loggia, and to paint the interior walls the warm blues, rose and orange colors he had evolved for the clothes of the Doni Holy Family. The entire south wall of the studio admitted to the courtyard.</p>

  <p class="normal">The furniture money had to come out of his own purse. He could buy only modestly: a wide bed, chest, single chair for his bedroom, for the loggia chairs and table which could be moved inside in wet or cold weather; a leather chair and bench for the family room, pots, bowls, frying pans, boxes for salt and sugar and flour for the kitchen. Argiento moved his bed from the workshop in the piazza, putting it in the small downstairs bedroom near the front door.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You should put pictures of sacred objects in your house," his aunt Cassandra told him; "to look at them will be good for your soul."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo hung his earliest Madonna and Child opposite his bed, put the Centaurs in the family room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Pure narcissism," commented Granacci; "your aunt tells you to put up sacred objects, so you hang your own work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They're sacred to me, Granacci."</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked joyfully in the late summer sun flooding the open studio, his head and hands rich with ideas that came tumbling over each other in profusion: the wax figure of the Bruges Madonna, the sketches for the Pitti tondo, exploratory figures for the Apostle St. Matthew for the Duomo; filing the bronze David for the French Maréchal. When the five-foot block arrived from Carrara for the Madonna, Argiento helped him set it up on a turntable in the middle of the studio. Within the hour he was massing around the edges, feeling the figures stir inside the marble, baptizing the brick floor of the studio with its first snowstorm.</p>

  <p class="normal">His personal fulfillment did not lead him to evolve a cheerful Madonna; on the contrary this Madonna was sad; she had already, through his sculptures, known the Descent. The tranquillity of his early bas-belief, when Mary still had her decision to make, could never be recaptured. This young mother was committed; she knew the end of her boy's life. That was why she was reluctant to let him go, this beautiful, husky, healthy boy, his hand clasped for protection in hers. That was why she sheltered him with the side of her cloak.</p>

  <p class="normal">The child, sensitive to his mother's mood, had a touch of melancholy about the eyes. He was strong, he had courage, he would step forth from the safe harbor of his mother's lap; but just now he gripped her hand with the fingers of one hand, and with the other held securely to her side. Or was it his own mother he was thinking about, sad because she must leave her son alone in the world? Himself, who clung to her?</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked as though he were on a holiday, the chips of marble flying, these smaller, compact figures coming almost without effort after the overpowering male massiveness of the David. His hammer and chisels had the weight of feathers as he evolved the Madonna's simple draperies, her long fingers, the rich braids over the long-nosed face, the heavy-lidded eyes, the boy's head of curls, powerfully shaped body, the plump cheeks and chin: an aura of compassion permeating the marble. He did not idealize the Madonna's face as he had before; he hoped to make her noble through her sentiment.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci commented, "They will be the most alive beings in any chapel they may be put into."</p>

  <p class="normal">Prior Bichiellini, who had made no comment on the David, came to give Michelangelo's new house the traditional blessing. He bent on his knee, spoke a prayer to the Madonna. Then he rose, put both hands on Michelangelo's shoulder.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This Madonna and Child could not have evolved in such tender purity if you did not feel tenderly and were not pure in heart. Bless you and this workshop."</p>

  <p class="normal">He celebrated the completion of the Bruges Madonna and Child by setting up a square block, rounding off its corners to give him the roughly circular tondo form, beginning work on the piece for the Pitti. The wax model on the armature took shape quickly, for it was an idyllic period for him, working in his own studio, wanted. This was the first circular sculpture he had attempted; by tilting the marble saucerlike, he was able to achieve planes-in-depth in which the Madonna, seated on a solid block, as the most important figure, emerged full-bodied; the child, though leaning on an open book in his mother's lap, receded to a secondary plane; John, peeking over Mary's shoulder, was buried deep in the saucer.</p>

  <p class="normal">He used half a dozen different textures in his finish, almost the whole alphabet of the chisel; only Mary's face was polished in the high flesh tones of the Pietà, enriching the emotional tactility. He felt this Mary to be the strongest of his Madonnas, mature; the child embodied the sweetness and charm of a happy youngster; the fingers moved freely within their circle.</p>

  <p class="normal">Argiento wrapped the tondo carefully in blankets and, borrowing a barrow from the carpenter next door, wheeled the marble through the streets to the Pitti house. Michelangelo walked beside him. They carried it up the stairs above the draper's, set it on a high narrow buffet. The Pitti were speechless, then the parents and children began to talk and laugh all at once, to run about the room to see the piece from different angles.</p>

  <p class="normal">The months that followed were the happiest he had known. The David, still called the Giant by most Florentines, was accepted by the city as its new symbol, mentor and protector. Things took a sharp turn for the better: Caesar Borgia, seriously ill, ceased to be a menace; Arezzo and Pisa seemed subdued; Pope Julius II, friendly to Florence, made Cardinal Giovanni de Medici important at the Vatican. There was a spirit of confidence and energy in the air. Trade was booming; there was work for all, a market for every man's product. The government, with Soderini as its permanent head, was stable and secure, the last of the internecine Florentine feuds forgotten.</p>

  <p class="normal">Much of this the city-state attributed to the Giant-David. The date of its installation marked a new era in the minds of the Florentines. Contracts and agreements were dated, "One month after the unveiling of the Giant." In conversation, time was divided by saying: "This was before the Giant," or, "I remember it well because it happened in the second week following the Giant."</p>

  <p class="normal">From Soderini Michelangelo extracted the promise that Contessina, her husband and children would be permitted to go to the protection of Cardinal Giovanni in Rome, just as quickly as he could persuade the members of the Council of Seventy. He was friendly and companionable at the dinners of the Company, stopped attacking Leonardo, helped other sculptors with their designs when they were seeking commissions. He obliged Argiento to spend more time in training with him. He climbed the hills to Settignano to watch the pile of thin decorative strips for his front cornice grow, each carved as though it were a gem. From there he walked to Contessina's to give Luigi a lesson and play with the growing Niccolò. He was patient with his own family, listened quietly as Lodovico told of searching for more houses and farms to buy in order to build an estate for his sons.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pitti family sent him Taddeo Taddei, a Florentine intellectual who loved the arts. Taddei wondered if Maestro Buonarroti might be willing to carve him a tondo. Michelangelo already had a point of departure, born while working the Pitti piece. He sketched the fresh idea for Taddei, who was enchanted. Now he had still another delightful commission from a sensitive man who appreciated what he was going to sculpture for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">A few months short of thirty, he seemed to have reached the full expression and acceptance for which he had yearned.</p>

  <p class="chapter">13.</p>

  <p class="normal">His period of grace was short-lived.</p>

  <p class="normal">Every few weeks since Sangallo had been summoned to Rome by Julius II, he had sent encouraging word to Michelangelo: he had told the Pope about the David; he had urged His Holiness to look at the Pietà in St. Peter's; he had persuaded the pontiff that there was no equal master in all Europe. The Pope had begun to think about marble sculptures; soon he would decide what he wanted carved, then he would summon Michelangelo to Rome....</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo passed several of these notes around at the Company of the Cauldron meetings, so that when Julius II summoned Sansovino to Rome to erect two tombs, one for the Cardinal of Recanati, the other for Cardinal Sforza in Santa Maria del Popolo, it stunned him. The Company gave Sansovino a noisy farewell party, in which Michelangelo joined, pleased over his old comrade's good fortune, hiding his own humiliation. He had suffered a severe blow to his prestige. Many in Florence asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"If it is true that Michelangelo is the first sculptor of Florence, why did the Pope not send for him instead of Sansovino?"</p>

  <p class="normal">During the early months of 1504 Leonardo da Vinci had spent his time in a series of mechanical inventions, suction pumps, turbines, conduits for the rerouting of the Arno away from Pisa, an observatory under his skylight with a magnifying glass for studying the moon. Rebuked by the Signoria for neglecting his fresco, he had started in May to work on it in earnest. The cartoon became the talk of Florence: artists flocked to Leonardo's workroom in Santa Maria Novella to study, admire, copy, change their styles. Word went around the city that something startling and wondrous was in the making.</p>

  <p class="normal">With the passing months the city became caught up in admiration of Leonardo and his cartoon, crying out about its marvels. It became the chief topic of conversation. The David was taken for granted now, as were the good times it had brought. Michelangelo began to perceive that he was being superseded. Admiring acquaintances and strangers who had stopped him on the street to pay their respects now nodded casually. He had had his day; it had passed. Leonardo da Vinci was the figure of the moment. Florence proudly proclaimed him "the first artist of Tuscany."</p>

  <p class="normal">This was bitter medicine to Michelangelo. How fickle were his Florentines! Relegating him to second place so quickly! Knowing Santa Maria Novella from the months he had spent there with Ghirlandaio, he managed to see the Leonardo cartoon without anyone knowing he was there. The Battle of Anghiari was tremendous! Leonardo, who loved horses as dearly as did Rustici, had created a masterpiece of the horse at war, in violent combat, ridden by men in ancient Roman armor, savagely trying to destroy each other, striking, biting, slaying as though they were the furies, men and horses alike caught up in violent, bloodthirsty conflict, many individual groups designed to fit into the brilliantly integrated pattern.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo was a great painter, he could not dispute that; perhaps the greatest the world had yet seen. Instead of reconciling him, this inflamed him the more. At sunset, as he was passing Santa Trinita, he saw a group of men talking on the benches in front of the Spina banking house. They were discussing a passage from Dante, of which Michelangelo recognized the lines as coming from Canto XI of the <i>Inferno.</i></p>

  <p class="versi">"Philosophy," my master answered me,</p>

  <p class="versi">"To him who understands it, demonstrates</p>

  <p class="versi">How nature takes her course, not only from</p>

  <p class="versi">Wisdom divine, but from its art as well.</p>

  <p class="versi">And if you read with care your book of physics,</p>

  <p class="versi">After the first few pages, you will find</p>

  <p class="versi">That art, as best it can, doth follow nature,</p>

  <p class="versi">As pupil follows master."</p>

  <p class="normal">The man in the center of the group looked up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Here is Michelangelo," said Leonardo da Vinci; "he will interpret the verses."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked so much like a laborer returning home from his day-long tasks that some of the younger admirers around Leonardo laughed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Explain them yourself," cried Michelangelo, blaming Leonardo for the laughter. "You who made a model of a horse to be cast in bronze, and to your shame had to leave it unfinished!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo's face turned a flaming red.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was not mocking you, I asked in earnest. It is not my fault if these others laughed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo's ears were plugged with the bubbling hot wax of anger. He turned away without hearing, struck out for the hills. He walked all night, trying to put down his anger, humiliation, sense of frustration and shame. He could not reconcile himself to having been passed by, treated cavalierly by the city that now turned its eyes elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had walked a long way in the night, up the river to Pontassieve. At dawn he stood at the confluence of the Sieve and the Arno, on the road that led to Arezzo and Rome. He knew that there was only one answer to his problem: he could never surpass Leonardo in handsomeness, in regality of figure, in superiority of manner. But he was the best draftsman in all Italy. No one would believe him, merely saying so; he would have to prove it. And no proof would serve except a fresco, of the same proportions as Leonardo's.</p>

  <p class="normal">Leonardo's fresco was going to occupy the right half of the long eastern wall of the Great Hall. He would ask Soderini for the left half. He would put his work up side by side with Leonardo's, prove that he could outpaint him, figure for figure! All the world could see and judge. Then Florence could say who was the first artist of the time!</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci tried to cool him down.</p>

  <p class="normal">This is a sickness, a fever. We must find some way to physic you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're not funny."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Dio mio, </span></i><span>I wasn't trying to be. What you can't stand is Leonardo's proximity."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"The smell of his perfume, you mean."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't be nasty. Leonardo doesn't use perfume, only scent."</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci looked at his friend's sweat-caked arms and legs, the shirt dirty from the smoke of his forge.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are times when a bath wouldn't kill you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo picked up a heavy beam, brandished it at Granacci and screamed, "Get out of my studio, you... you traitor!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't bring up the subject of scents, you did. Why disturb yourself over his painting, when you have years of sculpture at hand? Forget him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He's a thorn in my foot."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Suppose you come out second best, with a wall full of bandaged toes?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo grinned. "Trust me, Granacci, I'll come out first. I've got to."</p>

  <p class="normal">Late that afternoon he presented himself at Gonfaloniere Soderini's office, bathed, bartered, wearing his clean blue shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Phew," said the Gonfaloniere, leaning as far away as he could, "what did the barber put on your hair?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flushed. "...a scented oil..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini sent a groom for a towel. When it arrived he handed it to Michelangelo, saying, "Rub that stuff out. Stick to your own smells. At least they're indigenous."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo told Soderini why he had come. Soderini was flabbergasted; it was the first time Michelangelo had ever seen him lose his presence.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But that is unreasonable!" he cried, walking around his broad desk and staring at Michelangelo. "You've told me yourself that you never liked the fresco work at Ghirlandaio's."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was wrong." His head was down, his voice dogged. "I can paint fresco. Better than Leonardo da Vinci."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll put my hand in fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even supposing you can, why would you want to take the years away from marble? Your Madonna for the Bruges merchants is divine. So is the Pitti tondo. Your talent is a gift from God. Why should you throw it away for an art of which you want no part?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You were so thrilled, Gonfaloniere, to have Leonardo paint one half your wall. You said the world would come to see it. Why would not twice as many visitors come to two panels, one by Leonardo, the other by me? It would be a great <i>palio, </i>race, that would excite people."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And you think you can surpass him?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll put my hand in fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini walked back to the gold-emblazoned chair, dropped into it hard, shaking his head in disbelief.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Signoria would never approve. You already have a contract with the Wool Guild and Duomo to carve the Twelve Apostles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll carve them. But the other half of the wall must be mine. I don't need two years, the way Leonardo does, I'll do it in one year, ten months, eight..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, <i>caro. </i>You are wrong. I won't let you get yourself into bad trouble."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because you don't believe I can do it. You're right not to believe, since I come here with only words in my hands. Next time I come back it will be with drawings, and then you will see what I can do."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please," said Soderini wearily, "come back with a marble Apostle instead. That's why we built you that house and studio, so you would carve Apostles."</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini looked up at the lilies on the ceiling.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why wasn't I content with two months as Gonfaloniere? Why did I have to take this job for life?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because you are a wise and persuasive Gonfaloniere who is going to get the city to appropriate another ten thousand florins for the painting of the other half of the wall."</p>

  <p class="normal">To excite the Signoria sufficiently to spend an additional sum, to delight the Wool and Duomo Boards enough to release him from his contract for a year, he would have to paint a scene of glory and pride for the Florentines. He did not want to paint horses covered with protective trappings, soldiers in their breastplate armor and helmets, sword and spear in hand, with the confusion of rearing animals, wounded and dying men. This was not for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">But what was?</p>

  <p class="normal">He went to the Santo Spirito library, asked the Augustinian monk in charge to recommend a history of Florence. The librarian gave him Filippo Villani's <i>Cronaca. </i>He read about the wars between the Guelfs and Ghibellines, the wars with Pisa and other city-states. His fresco did not necessarily have to be a battle, but it did have to be a triumph of some sort to puff the national honor. Where in Florentine history was he to find such a scene, of the kind that he could paint; and which would stand in dramatic contrast to Leonardo's battle spectacle? One from which he could emerge the victor?</p>

  <p class="normal">It was not until he had read for several days that he came upon a story that quickened his pulse. The scene was laid at Cascina, near Pisa, where the Florentine forces had made camp on the bank of the Arno on a hot summer day. Feeling themselves safe from attack, a number of the soldiers had gone bathing in the river, others were coming out to dry themselves, while still a third group, having shed their heavy armor, was sun-bathing on the grass. Suddenly a guard burst into the group, crying, "We are lost! The Pisans are about to attack!" The Florentines scrambled out of the river, those on the bank hastily buckled on their armor, others went rushing for weapons... in time to beat back three Pisan attacks and to rout the enemy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Here was a chance to paint a large group of men, young and old, with the water and the sun on them, galvanized into action, all of them at a moment of danger, of tension, of pressure, recorded not only on their faces but in the bending, reaching, straining to prepare for the attack and save their lives. Here was a chance to create something exciting. They would all be Davids; a complete portrait of mankind, startled out of its momentary Garden of Eden.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went to the Street of the Stationers, bought the largest squares of paper he could find, colored inks, chalks, black, white, red and brown crayons, took them back to his workbench. Drawing swiftly, he organized the scene on the Arno at Cascina, in the center Donati crying to Captain Malatesta, "We are lost!" some of the soldiers still in the water, others trying to climb the steep bank, others throwing on a garment while reaching for a weapon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Three days later he stood in Soderini's office. The two men stared at each other, wide-eyed. Michelangelo fitted together on the floor beside the desk the dozen large sheets with twenty male figures, some crosshatched with the pen, others outlined in charcoal or drawn with long bold slashing lines heightened with white lead, still others glowing with flesh colors.</p>

  <p class="normal">He dropped into one of a row of tall leather chairs against the side wall, feeling tired and let down. Soderini studied the drawings in silence. When he looked up, Michelangelo recognized the affectionate regard in which Soderini held him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was wrong to discourage you. To be an artist one must sculpture and paint and create architecture with equal authority. This fresco can be as revolutionary as the David, and bring us the same joy. I'm going to get you this commission, even if I have to fight every member of the Council."</p>

  <p class="normal">And so he did, for a sum of three thousand florins, less than a third of Leonardo da Vinci's pay. It was Michelangelo's largest commission, though he felt disgruntled that the Signoria thought his work worth so much less than Leonardo's. They would change their minds when they saw the finished fresco.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now people stopped to tell him they heard he was going to paint a forest of Davids.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And so you have been repatriated," said Granacci, a touch caustically. "You are once again our first artist, providing the fresco comes out brilliantly. I only hope you're not paying too high a price."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A man pays what he must."</p>

  <p class="chapter">14.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was given a long narrow room at the Hospital of the Dyers, a charitable hospital that had been founded by the Art Guild of the Dyers in 1359. It fronted on the Street of the Dyers, just a couple of blocks from his early home near Santa Croce; he remembered it because as a boy he used to walk in the gutters which ran blue, green, red and crimson. His room faced the Arno, south, so that he had sun all day; the back wall was larger than his half of the Hall of the Great Council. He would be able to mount his cartoon sheet by sheet, and see it whole before painting the fresco. He ordered Argiento to keep the street door locked.</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked in an absolute fury, determined to show the city that he was a sure and swift master who did not need to be rebuked by the Signoria for dawdling over drawings of canal pumps and other mechanical engines. When the weather turned cold he sent Argiento out for wax and turpentine in which to steep the paper the Dyers used for windows. He drew his over-all design on an oblong strip of paper, cut to scale, then divided it into the number of squares be would need to assemble to fill the twenty-two by fifty-eight-foot wall. In contrast to his early Battle of the Centaurs, the key figures would stand ten feet high; yet this scene would have a similar sense of a group of nude warriors crowded into a limited area, all of the arms, legs, torsos, heads intertwined organically, as though integral parts of a whole, engaged in a melodramatic melee to get out of the water, into their clothes, their armor and ranks before the enemy fell upon them.</p>

  <p class="normal">He drew one young warrior, his back turned, wearing a cuirass and shield, a sword under his feet; naked youths who had picked up their spears and swords, ignoring their clothes; hardened warriors with powerful legs and shoulders, ready to spring at the oncoming enemy barehanded; three young soldiers just scrambling out of the river; a central group around Donati caught between consternation and the beginnings of preparation; a warrior shoving an arm powerfully through a shirt; an old soldier wearing an ivy wreath on his head, trying to draw his hose over wet legs, "so that all the muscles and sinews of his body are seen in strain," Michelangelo explained to Granacci, "the contortions of his mouth show his agony of haste, and how his whole frame labors to his toetips."</p>

  <p class="normal">Worked carefully, the Cascina cartoon, which he called the Bathers, would have taken a full year; done at the height of a young man's power and talent, it might conceivably have been done in six months. By New Year's Day of 1505, three months after he had started, driven by a force he could not contain, Michelangelo's cartoon was completed. Salvadore, the bookbinder, had spent the two previous days gluing the separate sheets together; now Argiento, Granacci, Antonio da Sangallo and Michelangelo stretched and tacked the cartoon to a light frame against the rear wall. It filled the room with fifty to sixty desperately challenged men. In the panel were contained fear, terror, hopelessness; and at the same time all the manly emotions surging upward to overcome surprise and disaster by swift purposeful action.</p>

  <p class="normal">Granacci stood gazing at the overpowering force of this body of men caught between life and death, each reacting according to his individual character and resolution. He was stunned by the authority of the draftsmanship.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How strange," he murmured, "that poor motivation can create rich art." When Michelangelo did not answer, he continued. "You must open these doors and let everyone see what you have accomplished."</p>

  <p class="normal">"There has been grumbling over your closed doors," added Antonio; "even members of the Company have asked me why you should lock everybody out. Now that they can see the miracle you have wrought in three short months, they will understand."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'd like to wait another three months," grumbled Michelangelo. "Until I have the fresco completed in the Great Hall. But if you both say I must, then I must."</p>

  <p class="normal">Rustici arrived first. Being Leonardo's close friend, what Rustici said would carry weight. He weighed his words carefully.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leonardo painted his panel for the horses, you for the men. Nothing as superb as Leonardo's has ever been done of a battle scene. Nothing as magnificently shocking as yours has ever been painted of human beings. The Signoria is going to have one hell of a wall!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Twenty-two-year-old Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, who was studying at Rosselli's studio, asked if he might sketch. Andrea del Sarto, nineteen-year-old Florentine who had transferred from a goldsmith's shop to the painters' <i>bottega </i>of Piero di Cosimo, also arrived with drawing materials. Antonio Sangallo brought his twenty-four-year-old nephew, who was apprenticed to Perugino. Twenty-one-year-old Raphael Sanzio, a former apprentice of Perugino's, was brought by Taddeo Taddei, who had commissioned Michelangelo's second tondo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo liked Raphael Sanzio immediately. He had a sensitive, patrician face, with wide, gentle, perceptive eyes, a full-lipped but disciplined mouth; long, luxuriant hair, fastidiously kept: as exquisite a face as Leonardo da Vinci's, yet in spite of a creamy skin, altogether manly. He carried himself with an expression of gracious warmth. His strong face was imbued with confidence, but there was not the slightest trace of haughtiness. His clothes, too, were as fine as Leonardo's, with a white shirt and lace collar, richly colored cloak with tight-fitting cap to match; but he wore no jewels or scent. The beauty of the soft-spoken young man's face, figure and clothes did not make Michelangelo feel ugly, awkward or shabby, as Leonardo's inevitably did.</p>

  <p class="normal">Raphael turned to the cartoon, spoke no word for the rest of the afternoon. When dark fell, he came to Michelangelo and said in a voice which lacked the slightest shred of flattery:</p>

  <p class="normal">"This makes painting a wholly different art. I shall have to start back at the beginning. Even what I have learned from Leonardo is no longer sufficient."</p>

  <p class="normal">The eyes he turned on Michelangelo were not so much admiring as incredulous; his expression conveyed the thought that it was not really Michelangelo who had done all this, but some outside force.</p>

  <p class="normal">Raphael asked if he might move his materials from Perugino's studio and work before the cartoon. Sebastiano da Sangallo terminated his apprenticeship to Perugino to study the shape and movement of the muscles in the figures in the cartoon, while at the same time painstakingly writing down his theories of what had impelled Michelangelo to draw the figures in such difficult positions. Without willing it, or even wanting it, Michelangelo found himself at the head of a school of talented young apprentices.</p>

  <p class="normal">A surprise visitor was Agnolo Doni, who had been spreading the word that it was he who was responsible for having started Michelangelo on his career as a painter. Had not Michelangelo protested that he was not a painter? Had not he, Doni, perceived that all he had needed to start him on this glorious career was Doni's confidence in him? The story was plausible. Because some people believed it, Doni was becoming one of the more important art connoisseurs in Florence.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he arrived at the Dyers' to commission Michelangelo to paint portraits of himself and his wife. He said loftily, "This commission could be the making of you as a portrait painter."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was amused. In his basic tenet, Doni was right. He had badgered him into painting the Holy Family. And if he had not got the feel of brush and paint, he might still have thought himself a world removed, unwilling and unable to touch the medium. But he was still beyond portraits!</p>

  <p class="normal">At that moment Raphael entered the hall. Michelangelo turned to Doni.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Raphael will paint your pictures, with charm and likeness. Since he's just beginning you can get him cheap."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are sure he can measure up to the high level of my art collection?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I guarantee it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Toward the end of January, Perugino came to the Dyers' Hall, having been moved to do so by Raphael's enthusiasm. He was twenty-five years older than Michelangelo, with the lurching gait of a countryman, a face scarred with gullies from years of privation when he had had to go without food for lack of the meanest coin. Perugino had been trained in Verrocchio's studio and had carried forward the immeasurably difficult technique of perspective begun by Paolo Uccello, Michelangelo welcomed him warmly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Perugino stood near the windows of the oblong hall in silence. After a time Michelangelo felt him advancing slowly toward the large cartoon. His face had turned charcoal, his eyes seemed glazed, his lips were fluttering as though in an effort to force out words. Michelangelo picked up a stool, put it behind Perugino.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please... sit down... I'll get some water."</p>

  <p class="normal">Perugino knocked the stool out from behind him with a savage backward kick.</p>

  <p class="normal">"...beastly..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Dumfounded, Michelangelo stared. Perugino thrust his left hand across his chest, fingers stiff as he swept away the cartoon before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Give a wild animal a brush, and he would do the same. You will destroy us... all we have spent a lifetime to create!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sick at heart, Michelangelo could only murmur, "Perugino, why do you attack me? I admire your work..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My work! How dare you speak of my work in the presence of this... this filthiness! In my work I have manners, taste, respectability! If my work is painting, then yours is not. It is a debauchery, every square inch of it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Ice-cold now, Michelangelo asked, "You mean the technique is bad, the drawing, the design...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know nothing of such matters," cried Perugino. "You should be thrown into the Stinche and kept from destroying the art that decent men have created."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why am I not a decent man? Is it that I have painted nudes? That this is... new?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't talk to me of originality! I have done as much as any one man in Italy to revolutionize painting."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have done much. But painting does not come to an end with you. Every true artist re-creates the art."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You go backward, before civilization, before God."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You sound like Savonarola."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will never get one figure of this immorality up on the Signoria wall. I shall organize the artists of Florence..."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stormed out of the Dyers' Hall, walking stiff-legged, his head held stiffly on his neck. Michelangelo righted the stool and sat down, trembling. Argiento, who had been hiding in a far corner, came forward with a cup of water. Michelangelo dipped his fingers, touched them to his feverish face.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could not understand what had happened. That Perugino might not have liked his cartoon was understandable. But to launch so bitter a personal attack, to talk of putting him in the Stinche... of having his cartoon destroyed... Surely he would not be so foolish as to go to the Signoria? He rose, turned his back on the cartoon, shut the door of the room, walked quietly with eyes on the cobblestones, through the streets of Florence to his house. He let himself into the studio. Slowly he became normal, the nausea passed. He picked up a hammer and chisel, worked the gleaming marble of the Taddei tondo. He turned his thinking upside down from the Pitti concept, creating everything in reverse: this would be a playful, joyous mother and child. He carved Mary on a secondary plane of depth in order that the son might dominate the scene, sprawled diagonally across her lap to avoid the goldfinch that John was mischievously thrusting toward him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had chosen a deep, resourceful block. With a heavy point he gouged out a background to give a sense of the deserts of Jerusalem, the white chips flying about his head as he happily stripped out marble with a claw-tool <i>gradina </i>to achieve the saucerlike effect, the bodies of Mary and John forming the circular rim, Jesus cutting across but connecting them, none affixed to the background, moving freely with every change of light. The smoky-smelling marble dust tasted as sweet in his nostrils as sugar on the tongue. He had been a fool. He should never have left sculpturing. The door opened. Raphael came in, quietly stood by his side. This was Perugino's countryman. Why had he come? "I came to apologize for my friend and teacher. He's had a shock, and is now ill..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gazed into Raphael's eloquent eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why did he attack me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perhaps it is because for a number of years now Perugino has been... imitating himself. Why should he think he should change, when he is one of Italy's most famous painters, beloved for his work here in Florence, at home in Perugia, and even in Rome?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I admired his work in the Sistine Chapel."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then can't you see? When he saw the Bathers he felt exactly as I had: that this was a different world of painting, that one had to start over. For me, this was a challenge; it opened my eyes to how much more exciting an art I had entered than I had suspected. But I am not yet twenty-two. I have life before me. Perugino is fifty-five; he can never start over. This work of yours will make his art old-fashioned." He paused, thought hard. "It can make one ill..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I appreciate your coming here, Raphael."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then be generous. Have the goodness to ignore him. It won't be easy. He has already gone to the Signoria to protest, and he has called a special meeting of the Company for tonight, leaving you out..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was aghast.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if he is organizing a campaign against me, I must defend myself."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Surely you need no defense? Here in Florence, where the young painters look to you? Let him talk himself out; in a few days he will tire, it will blow away..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All right, Raphael, I'll hold my tongue."</p>

  <p class="normal">It grew increasingly difficult to keep his promise. Perugino had begun what amounted to a crusade. His fury and energy were rising with the passing of time rather than abating. He had lodged complaints not only with the Signoria but with the Boards of the Duomo and Wool Guild.</p>

  <p class="normal">By February, Michelangelo discovered that Perugino had not been ineffective; he had gained a small group of adherents, the most vociferous of them seventeen-year-old Baccio Bandinelli, son of Florence's most important goldsmith, an aspiring sculptor; and several friends of Leonardo.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sought out Granacci. Granacci tried to preserve his usual calm.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They are joining Perugino for various reasons. There was some murmuring when you, a sculptor, got a painter's commission. But for others, the cartoon is a point of departure. If it were conventional, or mediocre, I think they would not care...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then it is... jealousy?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Envy, perhaps. Of the kind you feel for Leonardo. Surely you should be able to understand that."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo flinched. No one but Granacci would have dared say such a thing to him; or have known how true it was.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I promised Raphael I would say nothing against Perugino. But now I'm going to strike back."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must. He's talking to people everywhere he goes: in the streets, the churches..."</p>

  <p class="normal">As a start in his own campaign, Michelangelo went to see the Perugino paintings around town, a Pietà which he remembered from his home church of Santa Croce, a triptych in the convent of the Gesuati, a panel in San Domenico in Fiesole. He saved for last the Servile altarpiece in Santissima Annunziata for which Perugino had painted the Assumption. There was no question that his earlier work had line, brilliance in the use of clear, light color, that his landscapes were attractive; his later work seemed to Michelangelo to be flat, decorative, lacking vigor or perception.</p>

  <p class="normal">That Sunday he went to the dinner meeting of the Company. The moment he entered Rustici's studio the laughing banter fell away; a feeling of restraint came over the room.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You don't have to turn your eyes away and fall silent," he cried with a tinge of bitterness. "I didn't start this; I didn't want it."</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"È vero," </span></i><span>several voices answered. "It is true."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Nor did I invite Perugino to the Dyers'. He came by himself, then launched into the worst attack I ever heard. You are my judges that I have not answered back."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are not blaming you, Michelangelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">At that moment Perugino entered the studio. Michelangelo gazed at him for a moment, then said, "When one's work is in danger, one must protect himself. I have just studied Perugino's paintings here in Florence. Now I understand why he wishes to destroy me. It is to protect himself." There was a deadly silence in the room. "This I can prove to you," he continued, "canvas by canvas, figure by figure..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not in my home," broke in Rustici. "A truce is herewith declared. Either party breaking it will be forcibly ejected."</p>

  <p class="normal">The truce lasted until the following morning, when Michelangelo learned that Perugino had been so incensed by his statement before the Company that he was going before the Signoria to demand a public hearing on the decency of the Bathers. An adverse vote could mean the cancellation of the contract. His counterattack was harsh, but he could see no alternative. Perugino, he told Florence, had exhausted his talent. His present works were antiquated, still-life figures without anatomy, feeble rearrangements of earlier pictures.</p>

  <p class="normal">A messenger summoned him to the Signoria: Perugino had accused him of slander. He was suing for damage done to his reputation and earning power. Michelangelo presented himself at Soderini's office at the appointed hour. Perugino was already there, seeming old and tired.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soderini, pale and constrained behind his broad desk, with his fellow members of the Signoria ranged on either side of him, did not look at Michelangelo when he entered the room. He spoke to Perugino first, determined that Perugino had opened the attack, without provocation other than the sight of the cartoon. He asked Michelangelo if he had made certain charges against Perugino. Michelangelo admitted that he had, but claimed they were made to defend himself. The other members asked questions, then nodded to Soderini. Soderini spoke with considerable sadness.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Perugino, you did wrong. You attacked Michelangelo without provocation. You attempted to do him and his work personal damage. Michelangelo, you did wrong to belittle Perugino's talent in public, even though you acted in defense of your interests. You have hurt each other. But your Signoria is less concerned with this than it is with the harm you have done Florence. We are famous all over the world as the capital of the arts. So long as I am Gonfaloniere we shall continue to deserve that reputation. We cannot allow our artists to indulge in quarrels that hurt us.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Signoria therefore orders that you both apologize; that you shall desist from attacking each other; and that you shall both return to the work from which Florence draws its fame. The case of slander against Michelangelo Buonarroti is dismissed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo walked back to the Dyers' Hall alone, sick with revulsion. He had been vindicated, but he felt hollow inside.</p>

  <p class="chapter">15.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this moment that the summons arrived from Giuliano da Sangallo: Pope Julius II wanted Michelangelo to come to Rome at once, and was providing him with a hundred florins travel allowance.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a bad time for him to leave, for it was important that he transfer the cartoon to the Signoria wall while the painting was fresh and glowing in his mind, before there could be other outside threats to the project. After that, he had to carve the Apostle Matthew, for he had been living in his home for a considerable time and must start to pay for it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet he wanted desperately to go, to learn what Julius II had in mind, to receive one of those magnificent commissions that only Popes could grant. The aura of good will in which he had lived and worked these past five years had been broken by the Perugino quarrel.</p>

  <p class="normal">He reported the summons to Gonfaloniere Soderini. Soderini studied Michelangelo's face carefully for what seemed a long time before be spoke.</p>

  <p class="normal">"One cannot refuse the Pope. If Julius says 'Come!' you must go. His friendship is important to us in Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And my house... the two contracts... ?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We will hold these things in abeyance until you learn what the Holy Father wants. But remember that the contracts must be honored!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I understand, Gonfaloniere."</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked up to Fiesole to see Contessina, whose baby had died in childbirth, and to ask permission to speak to Cardinal Giovanni in her behalf.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I am not a Medici any longer, I am a Ridolfi."</p>

  <p class="normal">"He is still your brother..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Her eyes, as they rested affectionately on him, still seemed larger than her face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are kind, <i>caro."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"Have you a message to send to Giovanni?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Her expression altered only a trifle.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><span lang="EN-AU">"</span><span>Tell His Grace that I trust he is enjoying Rome."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had only to enter the Porta del Popolo to see and smell the startling changes. The streets had been washed. Several of the stinking forums had been covered with crushed rock. Gaping walls and abandoned houses had been torn down so that the streets could be widened. The Via Ripetta had been repaved; the swine market cleaned out of the Roman forum. A number of new buildings were under construction.</p>

  <p class="normal">He found the Sangallos living off the Piazza Scossacavalli, in one of many such palaces belonging to Pope Julius II, rather severely designed on the outside but with a spacious inner court surrounded by octagonal columns. When he was admitted by a liveried footman he found the interior richly hung with Flemish tapestries, the rooms decorated with costly vessels of gold and silver, paintings and antique sculptures.</p>

  <p class="normal">The palace was teeming with people. A big music room overlooking the courtyard had been converted to a draftsmen's workshop. Here half a dozen young architects who had apprenticed themselves to Sangallo were working on plans for broadening the piazzas, building bridges over the Tiber, constructing new academies, hospitals, churches: the plans originally conceived by Sixtus IV, who had built the Sistine Chapel, neglected by Alexander VI, now revived and expanded by Julius, nephew of Sixtus.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo appeared twenty years younger than when Michelangelo had last seen him. His oriental mustaches had been trimmed to European length, his hair was immaculately dressed, his clothes of expensive cloth; he exuded the air of a man who was fulfilling himself. Sangallo led him up a broad marble staircase to the family apartment, where he was embraced by Signora Sangallo and their son Francesco.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have waited these many months to welcome you to Rome. Now that we have the commission formulated, the Holy Father is eager to see you. I shall go to the Papal palace at once and ask for an appointment for tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sat down on a fragile antique chair that creaked beneath him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not so fast," he cried. "I still don't know what it is the Pope wants me to carve!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo drew up a second fragile chair, sat facing Michelangelo, their knees touching, overcome with excitement.</p>

  <p class="normal">"...a tomb. Not a tomb, the Tomb. The Tomb of the World."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...a tomb," groaned Michelangelo. "Oh no!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You don't understand. This tomb will be more important than the tomb of Mausolus or Asinius Pollio's Memorial, or the mausoleums of Augustus or Hadrian..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Augustus... Hadrian... Those are gigantic!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"So will yours be. Not in architectural size but in sculpture. The Holy Father wants you to carve as many heroic marbles as you can conceive: ten, twenty, thirty! You'll be the first sculptor to have that many sculptured marbles in one place since Phidias did the frieze on the Parthenon. Think of it, Michelangelo, thirty Davids on one tomb! Never has there been such an opportunity for a marble master. This commission makes you the first <i>statuario </i>of the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Unable to assimilate the words, he said stupidly, "Thirty Davids! What would the Pope want with thirty Davids?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo laughed. "I don't blame you for being dumfounded. So was I, as I watched the project grow in the Holy Father's mind. Statues as great as the David, I meant."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Whose idea was this tomb?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo hesitated for a moment before answering. "Whose inception? We evolved it together. The Pope was speaking of ancient tombs, and so I seized the opportunity to suggest that his should be the greatest the world had ever known. He thought that tombs ought to be built after a Pope's death, but I convinced him that such crucial affairs should not be left to the negligent hands of posterity; that only by utilizing his own fine judgment could he be sure to have the monument he deserved. The Holy Father grasped my reasoning at once.... And now I must run to the Vatican."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo made his way down the Borgo Vecchio to the Sant'Angelo bridge, crossed and went along the familiar Via Canale to the Via Florida. Every step brought memories of his earlier stay, some of them pleasant, some painful. He pulled up short in front of the Jacopo Galli home; the house seemed strangely shut up. As he knocked on the door he felt uneasy, realizing suddenly that he had not heard from Galli for many months.</p>

  <p class="normal">He waited a long time in the drawing room, airless, unused, without any of the disarray of books and manuscripts that Galli always left strewn behind him. When Signora Galli entered he saw that she looked bad, with a sallow paleness draining the last of her beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What has happened, Signora?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Jacopo is desperately ill. He has been confined to his bed."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But what...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"This past winter he caught cold. Now his lungs are affected. Dr. Lippi has brought his colleagues, but they do nothing for him."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned away, gulped. "Could I see him? I bring good news..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That will help. But I must warn you: do not show sympathy or mention his sickness. Talk only about sculpture."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli lay beneath warm blankets, his body making only the slightest bulge. The flesh of his face was wasted away, the eyes sunken. They lighted with joy when Michelangelo entered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, Michelangelo," he cried, "how good to see you. I have heard wonderful things of your David."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo ducked his head deprecatingly, flushed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Plenty brings pride," said Galli. "I am happy to see you are still humble, as humble as you can ever be."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Put not an embroidered crupper on an ass," Michelangelo quoted with a crooked grin.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you are in Rome, it can only mean that you have a commission. From the Pope?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. Giuliano da Sangallo arranged it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What will you carve for His Holiness?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A monumental tomb, rich with marbles."</p>

  <p class="normal">Galli's eyes were amused.</p>

  <p class="normal">"After the concept of the David, which created a whole new world for sculpture! A tomb! From the greatest tomb hater in Italy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But this is to be different: a tomb to hold all the sculptures I can conceive."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That should be quite a few!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Was there a touch of twitting in Galli's voice? Michelangelo could not be sure. He asked, "Is His Holiness good to work for? It was he who commissioned the murals in the Sistine..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, good to work for, providing you don't overemphasize the spiritual, or get him angry. He has an uncontrollable temper. He is a militant Pope, honest, decent: he issued a new constitution a few months ago which will do away with simony. There will be none of the scandals of the Borgias. But there will be more wars. Julius wants an army, which he will command himself, to recapture all of Italy that once belonged to the Church..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must conserve your strength, <i>caro," </i>said the <i>signora, </i>"Michelangelo will learn these things soon enough."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli fell back on his pillow.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So he will. But remember, Michelangelo, I am still your manager in Rome. You must let me draw your contract with the Pope, so it will be right..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would not move without you."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night there was a gathering at Sangallo's: high churchmen, wealthy bankers and traders, some of whom Michelangelo knew from Galli's garden, many of the Florentine colony. Balducci embraced Michelangelo with a shout of joy, arranged for them to meet for dinner at the Trattoria Toscana. The palace was aglow with hundreds of candles in high candelabra. Uniformed servants circulated among the guests with food and wine and sweets. The Sangallos were surrounded by admirers; it was the success for which Giuliano had waited for fifteen years. Even Bramante was there. He had not aged in the five years that had passed; he had the same curls at the base of his bald head, the pale green eyes still danced with laughter, the bull-like neck, muscular shoulders and chest had lost none of their wrestler's power. He seemed to have forgotten their argument in the courtyard of Cardinal Riario's palace. If Bramante were disappointed at the turn of fate that had made Sangallo the architect of Rome, he showed none of it in his manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the last guest left, Sangallo explained, "It wasn't a party. Just our friends coming in. This happens every night. Times have changed, eh?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Though Julius II hated the very mention of the Borgia name, he was obliged to occupy Alexander VI's rooms because his own quarters were not yet ready. As Sangallo led Michelangelo through the great hall of the Appartamento Borgia, he had time to take in the gold ceilings, silken hangings and oriental carpets, Pinturicchio's colorful murals of landscaped gardens, the enormous throne surrounded by stools and velvet cushions. Beyond was the smaller of the two reception halls, with its large windows framing green gardens and stretches of orange and pine trees as far as Monte Mario.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sitting on a high, purple-backed throne was Pope Julius II, about him his private secretary, Sigismondo de' Conti, two masters of ceremonies, Paris de Grassis and Johannes Burchard, several cardinals and bishops in full regalia, several men who appeared to be ambassadors, all waiting their turn for a private word with the Pope, who was pouring out an uninterrupted flow of observations, condemnations and detailed instructions.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo studied the sixty-two-year-old former Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere who, when deprived of the papacy twelve years before by the Borgia's purchase of the office, had had the courage to issue a proclamation for a council to depose "this false pontiff, betrayer of the Church." The act had forced him into exile in France for ten years; and had set Sangallo to mending church ceilings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo saw before him the first pontiff to wear a beard, a spare figure, lean from abstemious living, once handsome in a strong-featured fashion, but now with deep lines in his face, his beard showing streaks of white. What Michelangelo felt most was the enormous energy, what Sangallo had described on their walk to the Papal palace as Julius' "fiery impetuosity," echoing off the walk and ceiling. "Here is a man," Michelangelo thought, "who has been planning to be Pope for so many years, he will try to accomplish as much in a day as his predecessors have been content to do in a month."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Julius II looked up, saw them standing in the doorway, waved them in. Sangallo knelt, kissed the Pope's ring, introduced Michelangelo, who also knelt and kissed the ring.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who is your father?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Lodovico Buonarroti-Simoni."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is an old Florentine family," Sangallo proffered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have seen your Pietà in St. Peter's. That is where I wish my tomb to be erected."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Could Your Holiness stipulate where in St. Peter's?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the center," replied Julius coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo guessed that he had asked something wrong. The Pope was obviously a blunt man. Michelangelo liked his manner.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I shall study the basilica. Would you speak, Holy Father, about your wishes for the tomb?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is your task, to give me what I wish."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And so I shall. But I must build on the foundation of Your Holiness' desires."</p>

  <p class="normal">This answer pleased Julius. He began speaking in his rough-timbred voice, pouring out plans, ideas, bits of historical data, ambitions for the Church. Michelangelo listened as concentratedly as he could. Then Julius struck terror into him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I desire you to design a frieze of bronzes to go around all four sides of the tomb. Bronze is the best medium for storytelling; through it you can relate the most important episodes of my life."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo locked his back teeth, bowing low to conceal the expression on his face, wanting to exclaim, "To tell stories is for those who sing ballads."</p>

  <p class="chapter">16.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the last of the apprentices had left, Michelangelo sat on a stool before a drafting table in Sangallo's converted music room. The house was quiet. Sangallo set before him tablets of the size they had used to sketch Rome, seven years before.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell me if I am correct," said Michelangelo. "First the Pope wants a walk-in tomb. Second, he wants the tomb to suggest that he will have glorified and solidified the Church..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...brought art, poetry, scholarship back to Rome. Here are my notebooks on ancient and classical tombs. Here is one of the first, for Mausolus, in 360 B.C., in Asia Minor; here are my drawings of Augustus' and Hadrian's tombs, as described by the historians."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo studied the drawings closely.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sangallo, in these drawings sculpture is used to decorate the architecture, to ornament a façade. My tomb will use the architectural structure merely to hold my sculptures."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo stroked his mustaches, seemed surprised to find them so short.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Design a solid structure first, or your marbles will fall off."</p>

  <p class="normal">He excused himself. Michelangelo was left alone to pore over the drawings of gods and goddesses, allegorical figures, all overwhelmed by the structural mass. He would keep his tomb smaller, design the sculptures larger, so that they would dwarf the architecture.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was dawn by the time he put aside his pencils and charcoal. The sunless March morning sifted color into the room as though it were thin gray smoke. He made his way to the bed in the room next to Sangallo's son Francesco, climbed between the icy sheets.</p>

  <p class="normal">He slept a couple of hours, awoke refreshed and walked to St. Peter's, overjoyed to see that it had been securely counterpropped. He went into the Chapel of the Kings of France to see his Pietà. Strong morning light was coming in from the high windows in the opposite wall, suffusing the faces of Mary and Jesus. The marble was alive with poignancy. Fragments of memory stabbed through him as he ran his finger tips over the two figures, the exquisitely polished marble warm and alive to his touch. How he had worked to achieve this!</p>

  <p class="normal">He entered the main basilica, gazed at the altar in the center of the transept, under which was the tomb of St. Peter. This was where the Pope wanted his tomb to be. He then walked about the ancient brick building, with its hundred columns of marble and granite forming the five naves, wondering where in this central nave, which was three times as broad as the others and rose to a timbered ceiling, there could be a place for Julius' tomb, to join the other ninety-two Popes buried there.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped in to visit with Leo Baglioni and learned that, although Cardinal Riario had missed the papacy, he was as powerful as ever because Julius was his cousin; then he went on to the palace of Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, near the Pantheon.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giovanni, plumper than ever, the cast in his eye more pronounced, had had good times with Cardinal Rovere while they were both in exile. Now Rovere was Pope Julius II and Giovanni enjoyed his friendship. He was genuinely glad to see Michelangelo, to hear about the David. Giuliano entered the room, a full-grown man now, as handsome as the portraits Michelangelo had seen of Lorenzo's brother, after whom he had been named. And, for the first time that Michelangelo could remember, Cousin Giulio greeted him without hostility. He too was changed; with Piero dead, and Cardinal Giovanni head of the house of Medici, Giulio no longer feared that he would be repudiated.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do I have Your Grace's permission to speak of a delicate matter?" Michelangelo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giovanni still did not like delicate matters; they were usually painful. But he granted Michelangelo permission to speak.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is about Contessina. She suffers from the poorness of that little house. And almost no one dares visit or help her."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are getting money to her."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If it would be possible, Excellency, to bring her to Rome... to her proper place."</p>

  <p class="normal">A flush rose slowly on Giovanni's cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am touched by your loyalty to our house. You may be sure I have thought of this."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Florentine Council must not be offended," added Cousin Giulio. "We are only now becoming friends with Florence again. If we hope to regain the palace, all of the Medici holdings..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Giovanni waved a hand at him, lightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"All these things will be effected in good time. Thank you for calling, Michelangelo. Come as often as you can."</p>

  <p class="normal">Giuliano took him to the door. Out of eyeshot of his brother and cousin, he seized his arm affectionately.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is good to see you, Michelangelo. And good to hear you plead for my sister. I hope we can all be together again."</p>

  <p class="normal">He stopped at the Bear Inn, opposite his old rooms, rented an apartment at the rear overlooking the Tiber and the Castel Sant'Angelo, where he could have quiet and privacy, neither being available in the Sangallo palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he went on to meet Balducci at the Trattoria Toscana. Almost automatically he had slipped into his old routine. He had had a magnificent fulfillment in the David, a public acceptance. He had a house and studio of his own. Yet somehow as he walked the streets, their rough cobblestones not yet reset, he had the strange feeling that nothing had happened. Nothing had changed.</p>

  <p class="normal">What kind of memorial could he design for Pope Julius II? With nothing to disturb his gaze but the muddy waters of the Tiber, he asked himself, "What do I want to carve? How many large figures can I use? How many smaller? What about the allegories?" The tomb itself did not take him long: thirty-six feet long, twenty-three feet wide, thirty feet high, the ground floor thirteen feet, the first story, which would carry his giant figures, nine feet, the recessed third story, seven feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reading in the Bible he had borrowed from Sangallo, he found a figure vastly different from the David, but a figure that also emerged as a summit of human achievement and represented a model for man to seek in his own life: Moses, symbolizing the maturity of man, even as David represented man's youth. Moses, the leader of his people, the lawgiver, the bringer of order out of chaos, of discipline out of anarchy; yet himself imperfect, capable of anger, of weakness. Here was Lorenzo's half-man, half-god, who had triumphed for humanity, codified for the ages the concept of a single God, helped to create a civilization. He was a loving kind of figure, not a saint, but a loving kind of figure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Moses would occupy one corner of the first story. For the opposite corner he thought of the Apostle Paul, about whom he had read when carving the saint for the Piccolomini altar. Paul, born a Jew, a well-educated, well-bred Roman citizen and student of the Greek culture, was also a lover of the law. He had heard a voice that said, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest," and had devoted his life to carrying the message of Christianity to Greece and Asia Minor, laying the foundations of a Church as widespread as the Roman Empire. These two would dominate the tomb. For other corners he would find equally interesting figures to carve; eight in all, massive in volume, eight feet high though seated.</p>

  <p class="normal">Since these would be draped figures, he now gave himself the freedom to carve many nudes on the main level: four male Captives on each side of the tomb, with shoulders and heads towering over the columns to which they were bound: sixteen figures of all ages, build, spirit, caught in the anguish of the captured, the enslaved, the crushed, the dying. His excitement rose. There would be figures of Victors too, the uncrushables, the struggling, hoping, fighting, conquering. The tomb would have the scope of the Bathers in the three-dimensional, heroic character of marble.</p>

  <p class="normal">Julius had asked for a bronze frieze, and Michelangelo would give it to him, but it would be a narrow band, the least part of the structure. The true frieze would be this band of magnificent nudes extending around the four sides of the tomb.</p>

  <p class="normal">He worked in a fever of exultation for several weeks, nourished by the unending flow of sketches that were born in his brain and brought to life in India ink. He took his portfolio to Sangallo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"His Holiness won't want a totally naked male tomb," said Sangallo, his smile somewhat forced.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was planning to make four allegories. They will be feminine, figures from the Bible, such as Rachel, Ruth, Leah..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo was studying the architectural plan.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're going to have to have a few niches, you know..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Oh, Sangallo, not niches!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. The Holy Father keeps asking what you are going to put in the niches. If, when you submit the design, he doesn't find a single niche on the entire tomb... His Holiness is a stubborn man; he gets what he wants, or you get nothing."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Very well, I'll design niches... between each group of bound captives. But I'll make them high, eight or nine feet, and keep the figures well out in front of them: Victories, for example, and female figures. Then we can put angels up on this third level..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good, now you're beginning to think the way the Pope does."</p>

  <p class="normal">But if Sangallo grew more excited with the mounting pile of sketches, Jacopo Galli grew increasingly quiet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How many figures will there be in all? Do you intend to set up a studio, with helpers? Who is to carve these cherubs at the feet of the Victories? I remember you told me you couldn't design convincing <i>putti, </i>yet I see a good many of them indicated...." He searched Michelangelo's face with sunken, burning eyes. "...these angels holding up the Pope's sarcophagus? Do you recall your lamentations about carving angels?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"These are only rough sketches, to please the Pope, to gain his consent."</p>

  <p class="normal">He brought Sangallo his latest drawing. The Captives and Victories on the ground level rested on a platform of marble blocks, each richly decorated. Starting from the second story, between the Moses and Paul, was a short pyramid form, an arched temple containing the sarcophagus, and hovering over it, two angels. He had designed the front in detail, indicating that the other three sides would carry out the Pope's concept of having the captured provinces represented as well as his homage to the arts.</p>

  <p class="normal">By now he had between thirty and forty large sculptures indicated for the tomb, which left relatively little architecture to intrude upon his carvings.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo was enthralled by the magnitude of his concept.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a colossal mausoleuml Exactly what the Pope envisaged for himself. I'll go immediately to make our appointment with the Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli was furious. Over Signora Galli's protests he called for a servant to get him up, wrap him in warm blankets and help him into the library to study Michelangelo's drawings on the same antique desk where Michelangelo had written his sonnet to Alexander VI. His ill-suppressed anger lent him strength, he again seemed seven feet tall. His voice, grown hoarse during his sickness, was burned clear.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even Bregno wouldn't have been this obvious!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why is it obvious?" Michelangelo demanded hotly. "It will give me the chance to carve magnificent nudes, the like of which you've never seen."</p>

  <p class="normal">Galli cried, "I would be the last to dispute that. But the good figures will be surrounded by so much mediocrity they will be lost. These endless chains of decorative sausages, for instance..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"They're rows of garlands."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are going to carve them yourself?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...well, no, I'll be too busy...."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you going to sculpture these angels?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I could make the clay models."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And this figure of the Pope on top? You're going to carve that monstrosity?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo cried, "You're being disloyal."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The best mirror is an old friend. Why are you intruding a bronze frieze on an all-marble tomb?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pope wanted it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"And if the Pope wants you to stand on your head in the Piazza Navona on Shrove Thursday with your buttocks painted purple, you'll do that too?" Galli's manner softened. He said quietly, <i>"Caro mio, </i>you will carve a glorious tomb, but not this one! How many actual statues do you have indicated here?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"About forty."</p>

  <p class="normal">Then you are dedicating the rest of your life to this tomb?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why must I?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"How long did you carve on the Bacchus?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"One year."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Pietà?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Two."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The David?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Three."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then by the simplest arithmetic, these forty figures on the tombs will take you between forty and a hundred years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No." Stubbornly. "I've learned my craft now. I can work fast. Like lightning."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fast, or good?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Both. Please don't exhaust yourself, my dear friend, I'll be all right."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo Galli shot him a piercing look.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Will you? Let's make sure."</p>

  <p class="normal">He opened a cabinet of the desk, took out a batch of papers tied with a thin leather cord, the name Michelangelo Buonarroti scrawled across the top.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Here are the three contracts I drew for the Pietà, Piccolomini altar, and the Bruges Madonna. Pick up that pen, we'll write the best clauses from each."</p>

  <p class="normal">Signora Galli came to his side. "The doctor ordered you not to get out of bed. You must conserve your strength."</p>

  <p class="normal">Jacopo looked up at his wife with a shy smile, asked, "For what? This may be the last service I can render our young friend, and I cannot in all conscience let him go without it." He turned back to the contracts. "Now, if I know the Pope, he will want the tomb completed immediately. Hold out for ten years, more if you can. As for price, he drives a hard bargain because he wants his money to finance an army. Don't take a scudo less than twenty thousand ducats...."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo wrote as Galli dictated from the three earlier contracts. Suddenly Jacopo went deathly pale, began to cough, put the blanket to his mouth. Two servants half carried him back to his bed. He gave Michelangelo a fleeting "Farewell," tried to hide the bloodstained towel, turned his face to the wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he again entered the Appartamento Borgia, Michelangelo was taken aback to find Bramante engaged in animated conversation with the Pope. He felt uneasy; why was Bramante present at this hour appointed for the examination of the tomb drawings? Was he to have a voice in the decision?</p>

  <p class="normal">He and Sangallo knelt, were graciously received. A chamberlain set a table before Julius, who took the folio of sketches from Michelangelo's hand, spread them eagerly before him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, if I may presume to explain..."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope listened attentively, then brought his hand down sharply on the table.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is even more imposing than I had dreamed. You have caught my spirit exactly. Bramante, what do you say? Will it not be the most beautiful mausoleum in Rome?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In all Christendom, Holy Father," replied Bramante, his green eyes boring into Michelangelo's.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Buonarroti, Sangallo informs me that you wish to choose the marbles yourself in Carrara."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Only in the quarries can I be certain of getting perfect blocks, Holy Father."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then set out immediately. One thousand ducats will be provided to you by Alamanno Salviati for the purchase of the stones."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a moment of silence. Michelangelo asked respectfully, "And for the sculpturing, Your Holiness?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Bramante raised his eyebrows, threw a glance at Julius which to Michelangelo insinuated, "This stone carver does not consider it a sufficient honor to work in the service of Pope Julius II. He is grasping at this work for profit." The Pope thought for an instant, decreed:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Papal Treasurer shall be instructed to pay you ten thousand ducats when the tomb is satisfactorily completed."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo gulped, heard Galli's voice crying, "Do not take a scudo less than twenty thousand ducats. Even that will be short pay for a task that will take ten to twenty years."</p>

  <p class="normal">But how could he bargain with the Holy Father? Demand double what the Pope had offered? Particularly with Bramante standing by, a mocking expression on his face. The thousand ducats the Pope was advancing would barely pay for the major marble blocks and get them transported to Rome. But he wanted to carve these marbles! His need to sculpture had to come first. He shot a swift look at Bramante.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are generous, Holy Father. And now may I speak of the time for completion? If I could have a minimum of ten years..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Impossible!" thundered Julius. "It is my dearest wish to see the tomb completed. I will grant you five years."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt his heart plummet, the way it did when he had accidentally knocked off a piece of marble. Forty marble carvings in five years! Eight a year! His Moses could not be less than a year's work all by itself. Each of the Captives and Victors should have half a year to a year for full realization, the Apostle Paul...</p>

  <p class="normal">His jaw stiffened with the same obstinacy he had shown to Galli. One could no more bargain with the pontiff over time than over money. He would manage.... It was not humanly possible to create the entire tomb with its forty marble figures in five years, Jacopo Galli had been right about that. Then he would simply have to achieve the superhuman. He had inside himself the power of ten ordinary sculptors, of a hundred, if necessary. He would complete the tomb in five years, even if it killed him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He bowed his head in resignation. "All will be done, Holy Father, as you say. And now that it is arranged, could I presume to ask that the contract be drawn?"</p>

  <p class="normal">What he heard in response was a peculiar silence. Bramante lowered his head into his bull-like shoulders. Sangallo was stony-faced. The Pope glared. After what seemed to Michelangelo a tortured time, Julius replied:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now that everything is arranged, I should like you and Sangallo to visit St. Peter's to determine the proper place for the tomb."</p>

  <p class="normal">Not a word about the contract. Michelangelo put his left hand across his chest, feeling in his shirt the paper Jacopo Galli had dictated to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He kissed the Pope's ring, started for the door. The Pope called, "One moment." He turned, his hopes flaring. "I wish Bramante to accompany you, to give you the benefit of his advice."</p>

  <p class="normal">There simply was no room in the basilica, and no proper place for so imposing a marble tomb. It was obvious that his sculptures would be crowded in by pillars, without space around them in which to move or breathe. There would be no proper light from the small windows. At best it would be a bulking obstacle, a hindrance to all movement in the basilica.</p>

  <p class="normal">He went outside, circled toward the rear where he remembered a half-completed structure outside the west apse. Sangallo and Bramante joined him before the six-foot-high brick wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is this, Sangallo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"According to my studies there was an ancient Templum Probi here. Pope Nicholas V had it torn down, and started a Tribune to house a platform for the bishop's throne. He died when the building had reached this height, and it has been left this way ever since."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo jumped the wall, paced off the width and length.</p>

  <p class="normal">"This could be a solution," he exclaimed. There would be space around the tomb on all sides. We could build the roof at the height we needed, plaster the ulterior walls to set off the white marble, put in windows for light, break through the wall of the basilica for a square arch..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It has the prerequisites," Bramante commented.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No," decreed Sangallo. "It would never be better than a makeshift. The roof would be too high for the width, and the walls would slant inward as they do in the Sistine."</p>

  <p class="normal">Disappointed, Michelangelo cried, "But, Sangallo, we can't use the basilica!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Come with me."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the surrounding area were a number of ill-assorted buildings, built over the centuries since St. Peter's had first been erected by Constantine in 319; chapels, choirs, altars, a miscellany thrown up in total confusion of whatever material happened to be available: black tufa, cream-colored travertine, dull red brick, <i>peperino </i>speckled with dark lava and white limestone.</p>

  <p class="normal">"For a tomb as original as the one you are going to create," said Sangallo, "we must have a completely new building. The architecture of the building must be born of the tomb itself."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hope revived in Michelangelo's bosom.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will design it," Sangallo continued. "I can convince His Holiness. Here on this eminence, for example, there is sufficient space if we clear out these wooden structures and a couple of those decaying shrines. It would be visible from the city below."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo felt Bramante's eyes boring holes in his back. He spun around. To his surprise, Bramante's eyes were sparkling with approval.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you like the idea, Bramante?" Michelangelo asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sangallo is completely right. What is needed here is a beautiful new chapel, with all these surrounding impairments swept away."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo beamed with pleasure. But when Michelangelo turned to Bramante to thank him, he found that the architect's eyes had gone opaque, there was a twitchmg at one corner of his mouth.</p>
