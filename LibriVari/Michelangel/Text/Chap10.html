  <h1>BOOK TEN:<br/>Love</h1>

  <p class="normal">He rode his horse through the Porta del Popolo. Rome, after its latest warfare, seemed in a worse state of ruin than when he had first seen it in 1496. He walked through his own dilapidated premises on the Macello dei Corvi. Most of the furniture had been stolen, along with the mattresses and kitchen utensils, and some of the base blocks for Julius' tomb. The Moses and the two Captives had not been injured. He surveyed the rooms, looked around the overgrown garden. He would have to plaster and paint the walls, put in new flooring, refurnish the entire house. Of the five thousand ducats he had earned over the past ten years for the Medici chapel he had managed to save and bring to Rome only a few hundred.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We must put our house in order, Urbino."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can handle the repairs myself, <i>messere."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Two days after Michelangelo reached Rome, Pope Clement VII died in the Vatican. The city poured into the streets in a paroxysm of joy. The hatred of Clement, which continued to manifest itself during the elaborate funeral ceremonies, was based on his responsibility for the sack of Rome. Only the day before Michelangelo and Benvenuto Cellini had visited with Clement. He had been in good spirits, discussing with Cellini a new medal he was to strike, and with Michelangelo the design for the Last Judgment. Although Cousin Giulio had sometimes caused him suffering, he felt a considerable sense of loss for this last of his childhood friends from the Medici palace.</p>

  <p class="normal">During the two weeks it took for the College of Cardinals to assemble and elect a new Pope, Rome stood still. But not the Florentine colony. When Michelangelo reached the Medici palace he found that only the outside was draped in mourning cloth. Inside, the <i>fuorusciti, </i>exiles, were jubilant. With Clement dead there would be no one to protect his son Alessandro; he could be replaced by Ippolito, son of the beloved Giuliano.</p>

  <p class="normal">Twenty-five-year-old Cardinal Ippolito stood at the head of the Medici steps to receive Michelangelo, an affectionate smile lighting his pale countenance with its patrician features and jet-black hair. He was wearing a dark red velvet coat and cap, a band of bold gold buttons across his chest. An arm was placed about Michelangelo's shoulder; he turned to find Contessina's son, Cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi, with his mother's slight figure and flashing brown eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must stay with us here in the palace," said Ippolito, "until your house is repaired."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My mother would have wanted it," added Niccolò.</p>

  <p class="normal">A dozen of his old friends thronged to greet him: the Cavalcanti, Rucellai, Acciajuoli, Olivieri, Pazd, Baccio Valori, Clement's Commissary of Florence, Filippo Strozzi and his son Roberto, Cardinal Salviati the elder, Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, son of Jacopo, Bindo Altoviti. The Florentine colony in Rome had been swollen by those families from whom Alessandro had stripped all property and power.</p>

  <p class="normal">With Clement dead there was no further need to be discreet. What had formerly been an underground plot to get rid of Alessandro was now an open movement.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll help us, Michelangelo?" asked Cardinal Giovanni Salviati.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Most certainly. Alessandro is a wild beast."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a sharp murmur of approval. Niccolò said, "There is only one further obstacle: Charles V. With the Emperor on our side, we could march on Florence and overwhelm Alessandro. The citizens would rise and join us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can I help?"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was Florence's historian, Jacopo Nardi, who replied:</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Emperor cares little about art. However, we have heard reports that he has expressed interest in your work. Would you carve or paint something for him, if it would help our cause?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo assured them that he would. After dinner Ippolito said, "The stables that Leonardo da Vinci designed for my father are completed. Would you like to see them?"</p>

  <p class="normal">In the first stall, under the high-ceilinged beams, was a white Arabian steed. Michelangelo stroked the animal's long neck, warm under his hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He's a beauty. I've never seen so perfect a piece of horseflesh."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Please accept him as a gift."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, no," said Michelangelo quickly. "Only this morning Urbino tore down the last of our old barn. We would have no place to keep him."</p>

  <p class="normal">But when he reached home he found Urbino standing in the garden gingerly holding the animal by the reins. Michelangelo again patted the horse's elegant white neck, asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you think we should keep him?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My father taught me never to accept a gift that eats."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But how can I turn back such a beautiful animal? We must buy some lumber and build a new barn."</p>

  <p class="normal">He asked himself over and over again whether he was relieved to have the crushing burden of the Last Judgment off his shoulders. The altar wall of the Sistine would have required a minimum of five years to paint, for it would be the largest wall in Italy ever essayed in a single fresco. Yet as his ducats poured out for the repairs and refurbishing of his house he saw that he would soon be in need of money.</p>

  <p class="normal">Balducci, as wide as he was tall, but of hard flesh and red cheeks, now raising grandchildren in profusion, exploded:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Of course you're in trouble! Spending all those years in Florence without my financial wizardry. But you're in safe hands now. Turn over to me the money you earn, and I'll invest it so that you'll be independently wealthy."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Balducci, there is something about me that seems to alienate money. Ducats say to themselves, 'This man will not give us a secure home in which we can multiply. Let us go elsewhere.' Who is going to be the next Pope?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You guess."</p>

  <p class="normal">From Balducci's he went on to Leo Baglioni, in his same house on the Campo dei Fiori. Leo, with a leonine mane and unwrinkled face, had flourished as confidential agent to Popes Leo and Clement, a job Michelangelo had helped secure for him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm ready to retire now," Leo confided to Michelangelo over a dinner in the exquisitely furnished dining room. "I have had nearly all the money, women and adventure any man could ask. I think I will let the next Pope run his own errands."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Who is that Pope going to be?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nobody knows."</p>

  <p class="normal">Early the next morning the Duke of Urbino came to call, followed by a servant with a box containing the four contracts for Julius' tomb. The duke was a ferocious-looking man, with a trench-lined battlefield for a face. He carried a lethal dagger at his side. It was the first time since Leo's coronation twenty-one years before that the two antagonists had met. The duke informed Michelangelo that the wall had been prepared for Julius' tomb in San Pietro in Vincoli, which had been Julius' church when he was Cardinal Rovere. He then took from the top of the leather box the latest agreement, that of 1532, which "freed, liberated and absolved Michelangelo from all contracts made previously," and flung it at Michelangelo's feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There will be no more Medici to protect you. If you do not complete this last contract by May of next year, as specified in the agreement, I shall force you to fulfill the 1516 contract: twenty-five statues, larger than life. The twenty-five we have paid for."</p>

  <p class="normal">The duke stormed out, right hand clasped on the handle of his dagger.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had not arranged for the four unfinished Giants or the Victory to be brought from Florence. He had welcomed the release afforded by the change from the original walk-in monument to a single-wall tomb; nevertheless he had been disturbed because these enormous statues would now be out of proportion on the marble façade. For the additional three carvings he owed the Roveres, he decided to sculpture a Virgin, Prophet and Sibyl, the blocks for which were stored in the garden. These figures would be neither large nor difficult. He was certain the Roveres would be as well pleased; in any event his own sense of design demanded the change. By next May, as specified in the contract, he would be finished with the three smaller figures and his workmen could assemble the wall in San Pietro in Vincoli.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the matter of completing the Rovere tomb the fates were as much against the Duke of Urbino as against Michelangelo. On October 11, 1534, the College of Cardinals elected Alessandro Farnese to the papacy. Farnese had been educated by Lorenzo, but he had already left the palace for Rome before Michelangelo's time. From <i>Il Magnifico </i>he had acquired a lifelong love of art and learning. When his ravishingly beautiful sister Giulia had been taken by Pope Alexander VI as his mistress, Farnese had been made a cardinal, and entered into the dissolute life of the Borgia court, siring four illegitimate children by two mistresses. Rome had satirically called him "petticoat cardinal" because he had received his appointment through his sister's position. However, in 1519, when he was ordained a priest he renounced the pleasures of the flesh and began to live an exemplary life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul III sent a courier to the house on the Marcello dei Corvi: would Michelangelo Buonarroti come to the Vatican palace that afternoon? The Holy Father had something of importance to communicate. Michelangelo went to the baths in the Via de' Pastini, where a barber trimmed his beard, washed and brushed his hair forward over his brow. Gazing at himself in the mirror of his bedroom as Urbino helped him into a mustard-colored shirt and cloak, he noted with surprise that the amber flecks in his eyes were beginning to fade, and that the crushed declivity at the bridge of his nose no longer seemed so deep.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's odd," he groused, "now that it no longer matters to me, I'm not as plain as I used to be."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you're not careful," said Urbino, observing the self-appraisal with a grin, "you'll grow to look like a Michelangelo sculpture."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo entered the small throne room of the Vatican he found Pope Paul III talking vivaciously to Ercole Gonzaga, Cardinal of Mantua, son of the cultivated Isabella d'Este, and a man of superb taste. Michelangelo knelt, kissed the Pope's ring, his eyes quickly sketching the new Pope's face: the narrow head, eyes incisively shrewd, the long thin nose jutted over the snowy white mustache; the hollow cheeks and thin-lipped mouth speaking of the voluptuary turned aesthete. It was a strong face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My son, I consider it a good omen that you will be working in Rome during my pontificate."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your Holiness is kind."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is a matter of self-interest. Several of my predecessors will be remembered largely because of the art works they commissioned you to create."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo bowed humbly before the compliment. The Pope added warmly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wish you to enter our service."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo paused for the stonemason's rest count of one two three four.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can I serve Your Holiness?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"By continuing your work on the Last Judgment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, I cannot take so large a commission."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am bound by contract to the Duke of Urbino to complete Pope Julius' tomb. He has threatened me with disaster if I do not labor exclusively to that end."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is the Holy See to be intimidated by a war lord? Put the tomb out of your mind. I wish you to complete the Sistine Chapel for the glory of our pontificate."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, for thirty years now I have been tortured for the sin of signing that contract."</p>

  <p class="normal">Paul rose on his throne, his slight body trembling under the bright red velvet, ermine-trimmed cape.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is thirty years for me, also, that I have desired to have you in my service! Now that I am Pope, am I not to be allowed to satisfy that desire?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, it is your thirty years against mine."</p>

  <p class="normal">With a fiery gesture Paul pushed the red velvet skullcap back off his eyebrows and cried:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am determined to have you serve me, come what may."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo kissed the Pope's ring, backed out of the small throne room. Returning to his house, he sank into an old leather chair. A sharp knock on the door straightened him up from his collapsed position. Urbino admitted two Swiss guards, tall blond giants in identical yellow and green costumes, who announced that Michelangelo Buonarroti would receive, the following midmorning, a visit from His Holiness Paul III.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will find charwomen, <i>messere," </i>announced the imperturbable Urbino. "What refreshment does one serve the Holy Father and his train? I have never seen a Pope before, except in procession."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wish that that was the only place I had ever seen one," grumbled Michelangelo. "Buy <i>passito </i>and <i>biscotti, </i>raisin wine and cookies. Use our best Florentine tablecloth."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Pope arrived with his cardinals and attendants, causing considerable excitement in the Piazza del Foro Traiano. Paul smiled benignly on Michelangelo, went quickly to the Moses. The cardinals surrounded the figure in a field of red cassocks. It was obvious from the glance Pope Paul stole at Ercole Gonzaga that the Cardinal of Mantua was the acknowledged art authority of the Vatican. Gonzaga drew back from the Moses with his head cocked forward, eyes blazing with excitement. He declared in a voice compounded of awe, pride and gratification:</p>

  <p class="normal">"This Moses alone is sufficient to do honor to Pope Julius. No man could want a more glorious monument."</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul said wistfully, "Ercole, I wish I had said that."</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, turning to Michelangelo, he added, "You see, my son, I was not being unreasonable. Paint the Last Judgment for me. I will arrange for the Duke of Urbino to accept the Moses and these two Captives from your hand."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo had not lived through four pontificates without learning when he was outmaneuvered.</p>

  <p class="chapter">2.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he was young his mind had leaped to herculean projects. Once in Carrara he had wanted to carve a whole marble peak to guide the sailors on the Tyrrhenian Sea. But as he twisted restlessly in his bed that night he demanded of himself, "Where am I to get the strength to cover a wall larger than the Sistine panels of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Rosselli and Perugino put together?" He would not have to lie on his back and paint above him on the ceiling; but the wall would take as long, and drain him as utterly. How to summon at sixty the cyclonic powers he had enjoyed at thirty-three?</p>

  <p class="normal">Haggard from sleeplessness, he rose and went to early mass at San Lorenzo in Damaso. He bumped into Leo Baglioni, en route to his house on the corner. After each had confessed his sins and taken communion, they left the church and stood in the Campo dei Fiori with the pale November dawn on their faces.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Leo, you've been out carousing, and I've been wrestling with my immortal soul; yet it took you less time to confess than it did me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My dear Michelagnolo, to me anything that gives pleasure is good, while anything that brings pain is sinful. Ergo, my conscience is clear. From your wan look I would say you had put yourself through much suffering last night; ergo, you had much transgression to be forgiven. Come inside for a cup of hot milk, we'll toast Cardinal Gonzaga's tribute to your Moses. Rome is talking of little else."</p>

  <p class="normal">The hour of comradeship was relaxing. He left Baglioni's, walked slowly through the empty streets to the Pantheon, circled its majestic dome, then along the Via Recta to the Tiber and up the Via Alessandrina to St. Peter's. Antonio da Sangallo, nephew of Giuliano da Sangallo, and Bramante's assistant, had inherited the title of Architect of St. Peter's. As far as Michelangelo could tell, little had been accomplished in the eighteen years since he had left Rome except the repair of the giant piers and the building of the lowest foundation walls. Two hundred thousand ducats from all over Christendom had been poured into the concrete; but mostly, Michelangelo had learned, into the pockets of a ring of contractors who were erecting St. Peter's as slowly as was humanly possible. At the present rate, Michelangelo mused, St. Peter's would have trouble getting itself completed by Judgment Day.</p>

  <p class="normal">The tiny chapel of Mary of the Fever had not yet been removed to make way for the transept. He entered, stood before his own Pietà. How beautiful Mary was. How exquisite and tender. And the son on the mother's lap, how sensitive the face.</p>

  <p class="normal">He fell to his knees. For a moment he wondered if it were wrong to pray before his own creation: but he had carved these figures so long ago, when he was only twenty-four. Though there flooded over him waves of emotion from those distant days when he had first become a marble sculptor, he could not remember any of the actual detail of carving the block. It was as though someone he had known ages ago had done the work.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rome was in the streets in holiday clothes, for today was a feast day in which twelve triumphal carts would start from the Capitoline hill and be driven ceremoniously to the Piazza Navona. This year it was to be a race between buffalo and horses, then twenty bulls would be attached to carts at the top of Mount Testaccio and driven down the steep slope to where they would be slaughtered as a spectacle, even as had the little pigs he had watched with Balducci.</p>

  <p class="normal">Without knowing that he had so directed his steps, he found himself before the residence of the Cavalieri family. The palace was in the Rione di Sant'Eustachio, facing its own piazza and surrounded by extensive gardens. Square-cut, battlemented, the Cavalieri mansion had served for several hundreds of years as the center of continuous generations of Cavalieri "Conservators," Roman citizens who volunteered to conserve the Roman antiquities, old Christian churches, the fountains and statuary of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">It had taken him three weeks to achieve what could have been a ten-minute walk from his house in the Macello dei Corvi, along the narrow Via di San Marco and Via delle Botteghe Oscure, to the Cavalieri palace. As he dropped the heavy clapper against its metal base on the ponderous front door he wondered why it had taken him so long to call on Tommaso de' Cavalieri when in the back of his mind, during that last exhausting year in Florence, he had known that one of the reasons he looked forward to returning to Rome was the presence there of this charming young friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">A servant opened the door, led Michelangelo into the high-ceilinged salon on the left which contained one of the best private collections of antique marble sculptures in Rome. As Michelangelo walked from a faun with a bunch of grapes to a child sleeping on a rock with some poppies in his hand, to a sea horse in half relief with a woman sitting on it surrounded by dolphins, he recalled the affectionate letters that had passed between himself and Tommaso, and the drawings of Ganymede and Tityos which he had made for Tommaso to study.</p>

  <p class="normal">He heard footsteps behind him, turned... and gasped aloud. In the two years since he had seen Tommaso, he had made the transition from an attractive youth to the most magnificent male figure Michelangelo had ever laid eyes on: more beautiful even than the ancient marble Greek discus thrower that stood between himself and Tommaso: with broad, muscular shoulders, slim waist, straight slender legs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You've come at last," said Tommaso in a quiet voice, so surprisingly grave and courtly for a twenty-four-year-old.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had not wished to bring you my troubles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Friends can share troubles."</p>

  <p class="normal">They met halfway across the salon, gripped each other's arms in a tense welcoming salute. Tommaso's eyes had deepened to a cobalt blue, his features slimmed to a finer mold.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now I know where I've seen you before," cried Michelangelo. "On the ceiling of the Sistine!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And just how did I get up onto the ceiling of the Sistine?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I put you up there myself. Adam, about to receive the spark of life from God. Even to the way your light chestnut hair tumbles back onto your neck."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You painted Adam a long time ago."</p>

  <p class="normal">"About twenty-four years. Just as you were being born. You have made my portrait come true."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you see to what extent I will go for my friends?" said Tommaso with a chuckle. "I will even believe in miracles."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Miracles may not be impossible. I came through your front door heavy-footed and heavy-hearted. I spend ten minutes with you, and ten years drop off my life."</p>

  <p class="normal">"As your drawings have added ten years to my maturity as a craftsman."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How wonderful that an old man and a young one can exchange years, as though they were gifts on Befana's Day."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do not call yourself old," cried Tommaso. When he grew angry his eyes became dark as ink. "I am shocked to find you thinking so conventionally. A man is as old as the creative force within him."</p>

  <p class="normal">A warm smile spread over Michelangelo's features. The knots in his head and chest came untied.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know I am to do the Last Judgment for Pope Paul."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I heard at mass this morning. It will be a grand completion for the Sistine, to match the vault."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned his back on Tommaso to conceal the upsurge of emotion, stood running his hands over the exquisite posterior cheeks of an undraped marble Venus. A wave of happiness swept over him. He turned back to his friend.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tommaso, up to this moment I had not thought I could summon the courage to create a Last Judgment. Now I know I can."</p>

  <p class="normal">They climbed a broad flight of stairs. On the balustrade the Cavalieri had mounted some of their smaller and more subtle carvings: the head of a woman with a basket on it, a Roman sculpture of the Emperor Augustus, an open sea shell inside of which was a nude figure. Tommaso de' Cavalieri spent half of his day working for the tax commission and as curator of public works, and the other half drawing. His workshop was at the back of the palace, overlooking the Torre Argentina, a room stripped bare except for long planks on wooden horses. On the wall above the table were the drawings Michelangelo had made two years before, as well as those he had sent from Florence. Spread out over the planks were dozens of sketches. Michelangelo studied them, exclaimed:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have a fine talent. And you work hard."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso's face clouded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the past year I have fallen into bad company. Rome is full of temptations, as you know. I have drunk and whored too much, worked too little..."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was amused at the somber seriousness of his friend's self-reproach.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Even St. Francis was wild as a young man, Tomao," he said, using the diminutive to cause a smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">"May I work with you, if only for two hours a day?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My studio is yours. What could bring me greater happiness? See what your faith and affection have done for me already. I am now eager to start drawing for the Last Judgment. I shall serve not only as your friend but as your master. In return you shall help me blow up the drawings, share my models. We will develop you into a great artist."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso went pale, his eyes fading to the luminous powder-gray. He replied stiffly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are the personification of art. The affection you show me is that which you would show to those who love art and wish to devote themselves to it. I can tell you this: never have I loved a man more than you, never have I desired a friendship more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is an infinite sorrow to me not to be able to give you my past as well as my future."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have so little to give in return."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah," said Michelangelo softly, "there you are wrong. As I stand opposite you at this worktable I feel neither age nor the fear of death. Do you know anything more precious that one man can bring another?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They became inseparable. They walked arm in arm around the Piazza Navona for a breath of air, sketched on the Capitoline or in the Forum on Sundays, had supper in each other's homes after the day's work, then spent the evenings in stimulating hours of drawing and conversation. Their joy in each other gave off a radiance that made others happy in their presence; and now that they were acknowledged companions, they were invited everywhere together.</p>

  <p class="normal">How did he define his feeling for Tommaso? Assuredly, it was an adoration of beauty. Tommaso's physical being had a strong impact on him, gave him a hollow feeling at the pit of his stomach. He realized that what he felt for Tommaso could only be described as love; yet he was hard-pressed to identify it. Of the loves of his life, where did this one fit? To which did it compare? It was different from his dependent love for his family, from the reverence and awe he felt for <i>Il Magnifico, </i>his respect for Bertoldo; his enduring though tenuous love for Contessina; the unforgotten passion for Clarissa; his friendly love for Granacci, the fatherly love he felt for Urbino. Perhaps this love, coming so late in his life, was undefinable.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is your lost youth you revere in me," said Tommaso.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not even in my dreams did I look anything like you," replied Michelangelo scoffingly. They were sketching at a table before a log fire. He was blocking out his first plan for the Sistine wall: using counterbalancing figures for the side portions, some floating upward toward heaven, others falling downward toward hell.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You speak of your outer shell," retorted Tommaso. "My inner visage is plain. I would gladly exchange my features for your genius."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You would be foolish, Tommaso; physical beauty is one of the rarest of God's gifts."</p>

  <p class="normal">The color faded from Tommaso's face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And one of the most useless," he added in something of anguish.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, no," cried Michelangelo. "It brings joy to all people. Why do you think I have given my life to creating a race of glorious creatures in marble and paint? Because I worship human beauty as God's most divine attribute."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your people are beautiful because you have imbued them with souls. Your Pietà and Moses and Sistine characters, they feel and think, they know compassion.... That is why they live and have meaning for us."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was humbled by the passionate outburst.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You have spoken with the wisdom of a man of sixty, while I have uttered the foolishness of a youth of twenty-four."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was up at first light, eager to get to his drawing board. By the time the sun hit the top of Trajan's Column, Tommaso had come with a packet of freshly baked rolls for his midmorning refreshment. Each day a different model arrived, hired by Urbino in his search for the types designated by Michelangelo: laborers, mechanics, scholars, noblemen, peoples of all races and all sizes. Since there would be many women in the Last Judgment they had female models, the women from the baths, the bordellos, some of the more expensive hetaerae who posed in the nude for the adventure.</p>

  <p class="normal">He did a portrait of Tommaso, the only time he had paid anyone such a compliment: in black chalk, with his smooth cheeks, the finely modeled bone structure, dressed in ancient costume and holding a medallion in one hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you recognize yourself, Tommaso?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The drawing is superb. But it is not me."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is you, as I see you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It discourages me... it proves what I have suspected from the beginning: I have taste, I can recognize good work from bad, but I do not have the creative fire."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo stood above Tommaso, who was sitting hunched over a bench. His love for Tommaso made him feel fifteen feet tall.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tomao, did I not make Sebastiano a fine painter, and secure him important commissions? You have a thousand times his talent."</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso set his jaw squarely. He had his own convictions.</p>

  <p class="normal">"From your teaching I gain a deeper understanding of what is involved in this art; but no greater power to produce it myself. You waste your time thinking about me. I should not come here any more."</p>

  <p class="normal">After supper Michelangelo sat at his long table and began writing. By morning he had completed two sonnets:</p>

  <p class="txtIndent3">Love the Light-Giver</p>

  <p class="versi">With your fair eyes a charming light I see,</p>

  <p class="versi">For which my own blind eyes would peer in vain;</p>

  <p class="versi">Stayed by your feet, the burden I sustain</p>

  <p class="versi">Which my lame feet find all too strong for me;</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Wingless upon your pinions forth I fly;</p>

  <p class="versi">Heavenward your spirit stirreth me to strain;</p>

  <p class="versi">E'en as you will, I blush and blanch again,</p>

  <p class="versi">Freeze in the sun, burn 'neath a frosty sky.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Your will includes and is lord of mine;</p>

  <p class="versi">Life to my thoughts within your heart is given;</p>

  <p class="versi">My words begin to breathe upon your breath:</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Like to the moon am I, that cannot shine</p>

  <p class="versi">Alone; for lo! our eyes see nought in heaven</p>

  <p class="versi">Save what the living sun illumineth.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Tommaso arrived at the studio Michelangelo handed him the first sonnet. As Tommaso read, his face flushed. Michelangelo took the second sheet from his workbench, said, "This is the second poem I wrote."</p>

  <p class="versi">I saw no mortal beauty with these eyes</p>

  <p class="versi">When perfect peace in thy fair eyes I found;</p>

  <p class="versi">But far within, where all is holy ground,</p>

  <p class="versi">My soul felt Love, her comrade of the skies....</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso stood with his head bowed, remaining that way for a long moment. Then he raised eyes that were clear and radiant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I am unworthy of such a love; but I shall do everything possible to deserve it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let us not get our just deserts," said Michelangelo with a gentle smile, "or Judgment Day will be unbearable."</p>

  <p class="chapter">3.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood alone in the Sistine Chapel, the tumultuous array from Genesis overhead, making a detailed survey of the altar wall. Jonah, presiding at the end of the ceiling on a marble throne, would sit as an Old Testament prophet over the judgments of the New Testament Christ.</p>

  <p class="normal">The fifty-five-foot-high wall, forty feet wide, was busy and chopped up; in the bottom zone were painted tapestries similar to the ones on the long side walls; above the table-altar were two Perugino frescoes, the Finding of Moses and Birth of Christ; in the next area were the two tall windows corresponding to those on the side walls, with portraits of the first two Popes, St. Linus and St. Cletus; and then, in the topmost, or fourth compartment, his own two lunettes in which he had painted the early ancestors of Christ.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wall was fire-blackened at the bottom, pitted and broken at the second height; above, there was spoilage from damp, and an over-all soiling of dust, grime and smoke from the candles burned on the altar. He disliked destroying the Perugino frescoes, but since he was also obliterating two of his own lunette paintings no one could think him vengeful. He would seal up the two diverting windows, build a new baked-brick wall which he would engineer to slant outward a foot from ceiling to floor so that dust, dirt and smoke would no longer adhere.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul readily gave his consent to Michelangelo's building plans. Michelangelo found himself liking the Farnese Pope more and more, developing a feeling of friendship for him. Having lived through the excesses of youth, Paul had become a Latin and Greek scholar, a fine speaker and writer. He intended to avoid the wars of Julius, the orgies of Leo, the international blunders and intrigues of Clement. He also was blessed with an astute sense of humor, as Michelangelo learned when he called at the Vatican. Noting the pontiffs good color and bright gleam of the eyes, he remarked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your Holiness is looking well today."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No so loud," said Paul with mock whisper, "you'll disappoint the College of Cardinals. They only elected me because they thought I was on my deathbed. But the papacy agrees with me, and I shall outlive them all."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was happy during these months of steady drawing in the studio that Urbino had redone with a touch of color in the walls. Drawing, like food, drink and sleep, puts strength back into a man. Through the medium of his drawing hand he was beginning to catch the tail of some germinal ideas. The Last Day had been promised by the Christian faith to coincide with the end of the world. Could that be? Could God have created the world in order to abandon it? The decision to create man had been God's alone. Then was not God powerful enough to sustain the world forever; in spite of wickedness and evil? Would He not want to? Since every man judged himself before death, either in confessing his sins or dying unrepentant, could not the Last Judgment be a concept of a millennium which God held forever in reserve, with Christ just arriving among the nations of men, about to begin judgment? He did not believe he could paint the Last Judgment as something that had already happened, but only at the moment of inception. Then he might portray man's agonizing appraisal of himself. There could be no evasions, deceits. He believed that each individual was responsible for his conduct on earth, that there was a judge within. Could even a blazingly angry Christ inflict greater retribution? Could Dante's Charon in his rowboat on the river Acheron whip the miscreants into a deeper, more everlasting hell than man's unvarnished verdict on himself?</p>

  <p class="normal">From the moment his pen touched the paper he sought the contour of the human form, a single line for each figure, nervous in quality to denote the desperate urgency behind its movements. Repeatedly he dipped the quill in the ink, impatient to have to interrupt the continuity of his linear passage, wanting to achieve a simultaneity of form and space. Inside the contour lines he used a system of parallel blocking and crosshatching to describe the play of muscles in their various states of stress as affected by the nervous tensions of the contours. What he sought was a sharp delineation of the human body from the crisp air about the figure; this he achieved by probing into the bare nerves of space. Every man, woman and child was to stand out in stark clarity, to achieve his full human dignity; for each was an individual and had worth. This was the key to the rebirth of human learning and freedom that had been sired in Florence, after the darkness of a thousand years. Never would he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, a Tuscan, be responsible for reducing man to an indistinguishable part of an inchoate mass, not even en route to heaven or hell!</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he would not have admitted it, his arms were weary after the ten years of continuous carving on the Medici chapel. The more he studied his vault in the Sistine, the more he came to think that painting might become a noble and permanent art, after all.</p>

  <p class="normal">He found himself the center of a group of young Florentines who met in the refurbished studio of the Macello dei Corvi house each afternoon to implement their plans for the conquest of Alessandro. The leaders were the brilliant, vital Cardinal Ippolito, who was sharing with Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga the leadership of Rome's high society of artists and scholars; the gentle and lovable Cardinal Niccolò; Roberto Strozzi, whose father had helped Michelangelo put Giovansimone and Sigismondo in the wool business, and whose grandfather had bought Michelangelo's first sculpture; the sons and grandsons of the long-established Florentine colony into whose homes he had been invited on his first visit to Rome, while Cardinal Riario was keeping him dangling. When he went visiting of a Sunday evening he found himself the focus of an attentive and excited group of young people: Pierantonio, the sculptor; Pierino del Vaga, most popular stuccoworker and decorator in Rome, and his disciple, Marcello Mantovano; Jacopino del Conte, a young Florentine pupil of Andrea del Sarto, who had followed Michelangelo to Rome; Lorenzetto Lotti, an architect of St. Peter's and son of the bell caster who had worked for Michelangelo in Bologna. The young people believed him a man of courage who had stood up to Popes; a worthy son of Lorenzo the Magnificent. At a time when Florence had descended to the depths, when its children despaired, they took comfort from the idea that Michelangelo towered above Europe like a Monte Altissimo. He made them proud to be Tuscans; singlehanded he had created more works of pure genius than all other artists combined. If Florence could create a Michelangelo it could survive an Alessandro.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo realized with a pang that he had never enjoyed this kind of acceptance before; nor, for that matter, would he have been receptive if it had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My nature is changing," he commented to Tommaso. "While I was painting the vault I talked to no one but Michi."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Was it a period of unhappiness for you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"An artist working at the top of his powers exists in a realm beyond human happiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">He knew that this change in his nature had been brought about, in part, by his feeling for Tommaso. He admired Tommaso's handsomeness and nobility of spirit as though he were a young man falling in love with his first girl. He had all the symptoms: an overwhelming joy when Tommaso came into the room, a sense of forlornness when he left, pain-fraught hours until he could see him again. He gazed over at Tommaso, who was drawing concentratedly with charcoal. He dared not tell him how he felt, and so late at night he wrote sonnets instead:</p>

  <p class="versi">Love is not always harsh and deadly sin:</p>

  <p class="versi">If it be love of loveliness divine,</p>

  <p class="versi">If it leaves the heart all soft and infantine</p>

  <p class="versi">For rays of God's own grace to enter in....</p>

  <p class="normal">News reached Rome that Charles V planned to marry his illegitimate daughter Margaret to Alessandro; that would mean an alliance between the Emperor and Alessandro, which would keep Alessandro in power. The hopes of the Florentine colony were dashed. A more personal disappointment for Michelangelo was Friar Sebastiano, round as a butterball, just returned after a journey.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My dear <i>compare, </i>how wonderful to see you again! You must come to San Pietro in Montorio to see how well I transformed your drawings to oils."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Oils? You were supposed to work in fresco."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sebastiano's blush flooded downward through a large quantity of jowl.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Fresco is for you, dear master, who never make a mistake. Oil is better for my temperament: if I make a dozen mistakes, I can wipe them off and start over."</p>

  <p class="normal">They mounted to San Pietro in Montorio, which overlooked Rome. The air was pellucid, the waters of the Tiber as it wove through the tile roofs a clear blue under the whiter sky. In the courtyard they passed Bramante's Tempietto, a jewel of architecture which always wrung an exclamation of praise from Michelangelo. Inside the church, Sebastiano proudly led Michelangelo to the first chapel on the right. He saw that Sebastiano had done a masterly job of blowing up his, Michelangelo's, drawings; that the colors had remained fresh and unchanged. Former artists who had painted with oil on walls, even such masters as Andrea del Castagno, Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo, frequently had had their figures fade or turn black.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a new method I invented," explained Sebastiano proudly. "I use a rough cast of lime mixed with mastic and resin, melt them together over a fire, then smooth them on the wall with a white-hot trowel. Aren't you proud of me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"What else have you painted since this chapel?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"...not much..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if you were so proud of perfecting a new method?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"When Pope Clement appointed me Keeper of the Seals no longer needed to work. I had all the money I wanted."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That was the only reason you painted?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sebastiano turned on Michelangelo and stared, as though his benefactor had suddenly been bereft of his senses.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What other reason could there be?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo started to grow angry, then realized that he was dealing with an amiable child.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sebastiano, you're entirely right. Sing, play your lute, amuse yourself. Art should be practiced only by those poor wretches who can't help themselves."</p>

  <p class="normal">The halting of St. Peter's was a more bitter potion. Though hundreds of men had been employed and tons of cement mixed during the months since his arrival in Rome, his experienced eye told him that no progress had been made in the body of the construction, or fabric of the church. The Florentine colony knew about the waste of money and time; but not even his three young cardinal friends could tell him whether Pope Paul suspected. Antonio da Sangallo had become so firmly entrenched during his twenty years as architect of St. Peter's that no one dared attack him. Michelangelo realized that it was the better part of discretion to keep still. Yet he burned inwardly, for he had never gotten over the feeling that St. Peter's was his own project because he had been part of the cause of its inception. When he could be silent no longer he found a moment to tell the Pope what was going on.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul listened patiently, smoothing down his long white beard.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Did you not make the same charge against Bramante? The court will say that you are jealous of Antonio da Sangallo. It puts you in a bad light."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been in a bad light most of my life."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Paint the Last Judgment, Michelangelo, and let Antonio da Sangallo build St. Peter's."</p>

  <p class="normal">When he reached home, frustrated, he found Tommaso waiting for him with Cardinals Ippolito and Niccolò. Each was pacing his own orbit of floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You look like a delegation."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We are," replied Ippolito. "Charles V is coming through Rome. He will visit with only one private person, Vittoria Colonna, the Marchesa di Pescara. He is a long-time friend of her husband's family in Naples."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do not know the marchesa."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I do," replied Tommaso. I have asked her to invite you to her gathering this Sunday afternoon. You'll go, of course?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Before Michelangelo could ask, "But how do I fit in?" Niccolò, with Contessina's somber brown eyes, said, "It would mean a great deal to Florence if you became friends with the marchesa and could be introduced by her to the Emperor when he comes to Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">When the two cardinals had gone Tommaso said, "Actually I have wanted you to meet Vittoria Colonna. In the years since you last lived here she has become the first lady of Rome. She is a rare poet, one of the finest minds in Rome. She is beautiful. She is also a saint."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Are you in love with the lady?" asked Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso laughed good-naturedly. "Oh no, she is a woman of forty-six, has had a wonderful romance and marriage, and has been widowed for the past ten years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is she a Colonna from the palace on the Quirinal, above me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, a sister of Ascanio Colonna, though she rarely uses the palace. Most of the time she stays at a convent where they have the head of St. John the Baptist. She prefers the austere life of the mothers and sisters."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria Colonna, daughter of one of the most powerful families in Italy, had been engaged to Ferrante Francesco d'Avalos of Naples, the Marchese di Pescara, when each had been four years old. They were married in a lavish wedding in Ischia when they were nineteen. The honeymoon was short-lived, for the marchese was a general in the service of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian, and had had to leave for the wars. In the sixteen years of their marriage Vittoria had seldom seen her husband. In 1512 he had been wounded in the Battle of Ravenna. Vittoria had nursed him back to life, but he had returned to his command, and thirteen years later was killed at the Battle of Pavia in Lombardy after heroic action on the field. The lonely Vittoria had spent the long years of separation in a disciplined study of Greek and Latin, and had become one of the best scholars of Italy. At her husband's death she had attempted to take the veil, but Pope Clement had forbidden it. She had spent the last ten years giving her service and fortune to the poor, and to the building of convents, thereby enabling the innumerable young girls who were without dowries, and hence could not find husbands, to enter the nunnery. Her poems were considered to be among the most important literary events of the time.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've seen only one saint walking around in shoe leather," commented Michelangelo; "that was Prior Bichiellini. I shall be interested to see what the female version looks like."</p>

  <p class="normal">That was the last he thought about Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa di Pescara, until late Sunday afternoon when Tommaso called for him and they walked up the Via de' Cavalli past the Colonna gardens on one side and the Baths of Constantine on the other, to the top of Monte Cavallo, named after the two marble Horse Tamers which Leo Baglioni had taken him to see on his first day in Rome. The gardens of the convent of San Silvestro al Quirinale were filled with warm spring sunlight, there were laurels for shade, and old stone benches against walls covered with green ivy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria Colonna, sitting in the midst of half a dozen men, rose to greet him. Michelangelo found himself considerably surprised. After Tommaso's description of her deprivation and sorrow, of her saintliness, he had expected to meet an old lady in black, showing the ravages of tragedy on her face. Instead he found himself gazing into the deep green eyes of the most vitally lovely woman he had ever seen, with high color in her cheeks, warm lips parted in welcome, the expression of a young woman enormously excited by life. She had a regal bearing, though without hauteur. Beneath the lightweight cloth of her simple robe he envisaged a ripe figure to complement the large expressive eyes, the long braids of honey-gold hair looped low on her neck, the strong white teeth between full red lips, the straight Roman nose, slightly and amusingly turned up at the end, and the finely modeled chin and cheekbones which lent her face strength to match its beauty.</p>

  <p class="normal">He felt so ashamed at undressing the defenseless woman, as though she were a hired model, that there was a roaring in his ears, and he could not hear her greeting. He thought:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What a dreadful thing to do to a saint!"</p>

  <p class="normal">His repentance caused the noise in his ears to abate; but he could not take his eyes from her. Her beauty was like the noonday sun, filling the garden with its light but at the same time blinding him. With an effort he acknowledged an introduction to Lattanzio Tolomei, a learned Sienese ambassador; the poet, Sadoleto; Cardinal Morone; the papal secretary Blosio, whom Michelangelo knew from court; and a priest who was discoursing to the group on the Epistles of Paul.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria Colonna spoke in a richly melodious voice:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I welcome you as an old friend, Michelangelo Buonarroti, for your works have spoken to me for many years."</p>

  <p class="normal">"My works were more fortunate than I, Marchesa."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria's green eyes clouded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I had heard that you were a blunt man, <i>signore, </i>who knew no flattery."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You heard correctly," replied Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">His tone left little room for argument. Vittoria Colonna hesitated for a moment, then continued:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have been told that you knew Fra Savonarola."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. But I heard him preach many times. In San Marco and the Duomo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I could covet that experience."</p>

  <p class="normal">"His voice thundered through the vast spaces of the cathedral and bounded off the walls against my ears."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is too bad the words did not strike Rome. Then we would have had our reforms inside the Mother Church. We would not now be losing our children in Germany and Holland."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You admired Fra Savonarola?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He died a martyr to our cause."</p>

  <p class="normal">Listening to the intensity about him, Michelangelo realized that he was in the midst of a revolutionary group, highly critical of the practices of the Church and seeking a means to begin its own reformation of the clergy. The Inquisition in Spain and Portugal had taken thousands of lives on charges far less serious. He turned back to the marchesa, admiring her courage; her face was shining with dedication.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I do not mean to sound disrespectful, <i>signora, </i>but Fra Savonarola martyred a good deal of fine art and literature on what he called 'a bonfire of the vanities' before he himself came to grief."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have always regretted that, Signor Buonarroti. I know one does not cleanse the human heart by wiping clean the human mind."</p>

  <p class="normal">The conversation became general. They spoke of Flemish art, which was highly respected in Rome, and its sharp contrasts to Italian painting; then of the origins of the concept of the Last Judgment. Michelangelo quoted from Matthew 25:31-33:</p>

  <p class="versi">When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit down upon the throne of his glory, and all nations will be gathered in his presence, where he will divide men one from the other, as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats; he will set the sheep on his right, and the goats on his left.</p>

  <p class="normal">As they walked down Monte Cavallo watching the sunset deepen the colors of the city below them, Michelangelo asked:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tommaso, when can we see her again?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"When she invites us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have to wait until then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"We have to wait; she goes nowhere."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then I will wait," cried Michelangelo, put out, "like a silent supplicant, until the lady deigns to send for me again."</p>

  <p class="normal">An amused smile twitched the corners of Tommaso's lips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought you would be impressed."</p>

  <p class="normal">That night it was Vittoria Colonna's face that glowed in the room. It was many years since a woman's presence had so completely taken possession of him. The poet's lines that had been roaming through his skull replaced Tommaso de' Cavalieri with the Marchesa di Pescara; and at cockcrow he rose to write:</p>

  <p class="versi">Well may these eyes of mine both near and far</p>

  <p class="versi">Behold the beams that from thy beauty flow;</p>

  <p class="versi">But, lady, feet must halt where sight may go:</p>

  <p class="versi">We see, but cannot climb to clasp a star....</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Clogged with mortality and wingless, we</p>

  <p class="versi">Cannot pursue an angel in her flight:</p>

  <p class="versi">Only to gaze exhausts our utmost might.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Yet, if but heaven like earth incline to thee,</p>

  <p class="versi">Let my whole body be one eye to see,</p>

  <p class="versi">That not one part of me may miss thy sight!</p>

  <p class="chapter">4.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was two weeks before he received a second invitation. Somehow in the interval he had begun to identify the sculptural beauty of her figure, the strong but tender face, with his marble statue of Night in the Medici chapel. It was a warm May Sunday when the marchesa's servant, Foao, arrived with the message from the marchesa.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My mistress bade me tell you, <i>messere, </i>that she is in the chapel of San Silvestro al Quirinale; that the church is closed and pleasant. She asks whether you would care to come and lose a little of the day with her so that she might gain it with you."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was excited as he refreshed himself in a tub of cold water which Urbino set out on the garden porch, then dressed in a dark blue shirt and stockings he had bought against just such an invitation, and made his way up the hill.</p>

  <p class="normal">He had hoped to be alone with her, but as Vittoria Colonna came to greet him, gowned in pure white silk, with a white lace mantilla over her head, he saw that the chapel was filled. He recognized illustrious members of the Vatican court and the university faculty. A Spanish painter was complaining that there was no good art in Spain because the Spaniards considered painting and sculpture of little worth and refused to pay for it. The men began speaking of the art of their own city-states: in Venice the portraits by Tiziano; in Padua the frescoes of Giotto; the singular painting of the municipal chamber in Siena; in Ferrara the works in the castle; in Pisa, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza, Milan, Orvieto...</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo knew most of these works, and only half listened, for he was watching Vittoria, sitting motionless beneath a stained-glass window which threw a sheen of variegated color over her flawless skin. He found himself wondering about her; if her marriage to the Marchese di Pescara had been such a great love match, why had they been together only a few months out of the sixteen years? Why had the marchese remained in the north of Italy during the long rainy winters when no war could be waged? And why had an old friend looked away when he had asked under what heroic circumstances the marchese had been killed?</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly he became aware of a silence in the chapel. All eyes were turned on him. Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga politely repeated the question: would Michelangelo tell them of his favorite works of art in Florence? With his face slightly flushed, and his voice a little off key, Michelangelo spoke of the beauties of the sculptures of Ghiberti, Orcagna, Donatello, Mino da Fiesole; of the painting of Masaccio, Ghirlandaio, Botticelli. When he had finished, Vittoria Colonna said:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Knowing Michelangelo to be a modest man, we have all refrained from speaking of the art of Rome. In the Sistine he has done the work of twenty great painters. Surely all of mankind will one day see and understand the Creation through his painting?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Her enormous green eyes engulfed him completely. Now when she spoke, it was directly to him; quietly, chastely, yet her voice had a peculiarly throaty quality, her lips seemed only a few inches from his.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, do not think that I overpraise you. In point of fact, it is not you I praise at all, except as a faithful servant. For I have long thought that you have a divine gift and were chosen by God for your great tasks."</p>

  <p class="normal">He searched his mind for an answer but no words formulated themselves. He wanted to speak only of how he felt about her.</p>

  <p class="normal">"His Holiness has done me the favor of allowing me to build a nunnery for young girls at the foot of Monte Cavallo," continued Vittoria. "The site I have chosen is by the broken portico of the Tower of Maecenas, where it is said that Nero watched Rome burning. I would like to see the footprints of such a wicked man wiped out by those of holy women. I do not know, Michelangelo, what shape or proportion to give the house, whether some of the old work may be adapted to the new."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you would care to descend to the site, <i>signora, </i>we could study the ruins."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are indeed kind."</p>

  <p class="normal">He had had no idea of being kind, he had merely hoped that he and Vittoria could descend to the old temple alone and spend an hour together while going over the piles of stones. Vittoria invited the entire group to accompany them down the hill. Michelangelo salvaged the right to walk by her side, churned by her closeness, the physical, spiritual and intellectual emanation that engulfed his senses. He emerged from his emotional cloud long enough for the architect to break through, to make an estimate of where the convent could best be placed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Marchesa, I think this broken portico might be converted into a campanile. I could make you some drawings for the convent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I did not dare to ask for so much."</p>

  <p class="normal">The warmth of her gratitude reached out like two arms to embrace him. He congratulated himself on his stratagem in breaking down the impersonal barrier which Vittoria kept high between herself and the others.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will have some sketches in a day or two. Where may I bring them to you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria's eyes turned opaque. When she spoke her voice was constrained.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is much work to do at my convent. Could Foao bring you word when I am free? In a week or two?"</p>

  <p class="normal">He returned to his studio in a fury, began knocking things about. What kind of game was this woman playing? Was she paying him these extraordinary compliments merely to bring him to her feet? Did she admire him, or did she not? If she wanted his friendship, why was she refusing it? Shunting him off... for another two weeks! Could she not tell how completely he was taken by her? Did she not have human blood in her veins, and human feelings in her breast?</p>

  <p class="normal">"You must understand," Tommaso explained when he saw that Michelangelo was disturbed. "She is dedicated to the memory of her husband. For all the years, since his death, she has loved only Jesus."</p>

  <p class="normal">"If the love of Christ prevented a woman from loving mortal man, the Italian people would have died out long ago."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have brought you some of her poems. Perhaps you will learn more about her from them. Listen to this one:</p>

  <p class="versi">'Since a chaste love my soul has long detained</p>

  <p class="versi">In fond idolatry of earthly fame;</p>

  <p class="versi">Now to the Lord, who only can supply</p>

  <p class="versi">The remedy, I turn.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Me it becomes not, henceforth, to invoke</p>

  <p class="versi">Of Delos, or Parnassus; other springs,</p>

  <p class="versi">Far other mountaintops, I now frequent</p>

  <p class="versi">Where human steps unaided cannot mount.'</p>

  <p class="normal">And this from another:</p>

  <p class="versi">'Would that a voice impressive might repeat,</p>

  <p class="versi">In holiest accents to my inmost soul,</p>

  <p class="versi">The name of Jesus; and my words and works</p>

  <p class="versi">Attest true faith in Him, and ardent hope....'"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo chewed on the words for a few moments, running his index finger through the furrows of his brow.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She sounds like a woman deeply hurt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"By death."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Permit me to doubt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What then?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"My instinct tells me something is wrong."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Tommaso had departed, Michelangelo asked Urbino to refill the oil lamp, and sat quietly before the sheaf of papers, studying their content. He read from the poem written to her husband:</p>

  <p class="versi">Thou knowest, Love, I never sought to flee</p>

  <p class="versi">From thy sweet prison, nor impatient threw</p>

  <p class="versi">Thy dear yoke from my neck; never withdrew</p>

  <p class="versi">What, that first day, my soul bestowed on thee.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Time hath not changed love's ancient surety;</p>

  <p class="versi">The knot is still as firm; and though there grew</p>

  <p class="versi">Moment by moment fruit bitter as rue,</p>

  <p class="versi">Yet the fair tree remains as dear to me.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">And thou hast seen how that keen shaft of thine,</p>

  <p class="versi">'Gainst which the might of Death himself is vain,</p>

  <p class="versi">Smote on one ardent, faithful breast full sore.</p>

  <p class="versi">&#160;</p>

  <p class="versi">Now loose the cords that fast my soul entwine,</p>

  <p class="versi">For though of freedom ne'er I recked before,</p>

  <p class="versi">Yet now I yearn my freedom to regain.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was puzzled. Why had Vittoria described her love as a prison and a yoke? Why would she "yearn my freedom to regain" from a love to which she had devoted the whole of her life? He had to have the answer: for he knew now that he loved her, had loved her from that first blinding moment he had laid eyes on her in the garden of San Silvestro.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are ways of getting information," resourceful Leo Baglioni assured him, "among the Neapolitans in Rome, particularly those who fought alongside the marchese. Let me see who among them owe me favors."</p>

  <p class="normal">The material took five days to assemble; when Leo came to the studio he seemed weary.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The facts started raining on me as though someone had pulled a stopper in heaven. But what tires me, even in my cynical old age, is the amount of myth that passes for truth."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Urbino, be so good as to bring Signor Baglioni a bottle of our best wine."</p>

  <p class="normal">"First of all, this was no lyrical love affair. The marchese never loved his wife, and fled from her a few days after the wedding. Secondly, he wenched the whole way from Naples to Milan. Third, he used every excuse known to inventive husbands never to get into the same city with his wife. And fourth, the noble marchese pulled one of the most dastardly double treasons in history, betraying both his own Emperor and his fellow conspirators. Rumor has it that he died by poison, a very long way from anybody's battlefield."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I knew it," cried Michelangelo. "Leo, you have just made me the happiest of men."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Permit me to doubt."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What the devil do you mean?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Knowledge will make your life harder, rather than easier. I feel that if Vittoria Colonna learned that you knew the truth about her marriage..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you think I'm an idiot?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A man in love will use any weapon against a woman he is importuning..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Importuning! I have yet to get an hour alone with her."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was drawing at his long table piled high with paper, pens, charcoal, a copy of Dante's <i>Inferno </i>opened to the story of Charon, when Vittoria's servant Foao entered to invite Michelangelo for the following afternoon to the gardens of the Colonna palace on the hill above his house. The fact that she had summoned him to her ancestral home rather than a church garden or chapel led him to believe that they might be alone. In a fever of expectancy he wrestled with a stub pen:</p>

  <p class="versi">Nay, prithee tell me, Love, when I behold</p>

  <p class="versi">My lady, do mine eyes her beauty see</p>

  <p class="versi">In truth, or dwells that loveliness in me</p>

  <p class="versi">Which multiplies her grace a thousandfold?...</p>

  <p class="normal">The Colonna gardens occupied an important part of the slope of Monte Cavallo, thickly planted with trees whose greenery Michelangelo could see from his house. A servant led him along a trail heavy with jasmine in bloom. From a distance he heard a babble of voices and was keenly disappointed. He came in sight of a summerhouse shaded by plane trees, with a waterfall and lily pond to keep the air cool.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria came to meet him. He nodded to the men in the pavilion and sat down abruptly in one corner, leaning against the lacy white latticework. Vittoria sought his eyes, tried to bring him into the discussion, but he declined. Into his mind there flashed the thought:</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is why she refuses to love again. Not because the first love was so beautiful, but because it was so ugly! That is why she gives her love only to Christ."</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up, gazing at her with an intensity that could have pierced the tissue of her brain and the marrow of her bone. She stopped in the middle of a sentence, turned to ask solicitously:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Is something wrong, Michelangelo?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Then he sensed something else:</p>

  <p class="normal">"She has never known a man. Her husband never consummated that marriage, either on their honeymoon or when he returned injured from the wars. She is as virginal as the young girls she takes into her nunneries."</p>

  <p class="normal">He ached with compassion for her. He would have to accept the legend of the immortal love, and from that starting point try to persuade this courageous and desirable woman that he had a love to offer that could be as beautiful as the one she had invented.</p>

  <p class="chapter">5.</p>

  <p class="normal">His love for Vittoria in no way changed his feelings for Tommaso de Cavalieri, who continued to arrive early each morning carrying a jug of cool milk or a basket of fruit to get in his two hours of drawing under Michelangelo's critical eye before the sun grew hot. Michelangelo made him do his sketches over a dozen times, never appearing satisfied, but in truth well pleased with Tommaso's progress. Pope Paul had accepted Tommaso at court and appointed him Conservator of the Fountains of Rome.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso looked up from the drafting table, his expression intent, the blue eyes serious.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, there's not an engineer in Rome who knows how the ancients brought all that water down! Or would dare to rebuild the aqueducts. How can a people so completely lose their talents? I think I no longer want to become a painter. I should like to become an architect. My family have been Romans for eight hundred years. The city is in my blood. I want not only to conserve it but to help rebuild it. Architects are what the city needs most."</p>

  <p class="normal">The over-all design for the Sistine wall was now complete. He was able to count more than three hundred characters he had integrated from his original drawings, all of them in motion, no one still: a tumultuous horde of humans surrounding Christ in inner intimate circles and outer remote ones; vertical shafts of bodies rising upward on one side, descending on the other, the clouds below Christ presenting the only emptiness. On the bottom to the left was the yawning cave of hell, with the burial ground of the ages; the river Acheron was on the right. He set himself a schedule of painting one normal-size figure on the wall each day, with two days allotted to those larger than life.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Virgin emerged as a harmonious blend of his mother, the Pietà and Medici madonnas, his own Eve, six panels down the ceiling, taking the apple from the serpent, and Vittoria Colonna. Like Eve, she was a young, robust, life-containing female; like the others, she was glorious of face and figure. Mary was tactfully turned away from her son's merciless judgment of mankind, since she herself was not being judged. Was she also withdrawn in compassion because man must be judged, however just his fate might be? Did God judge the sheep, the oxen, the cattle, the birds? As a mother, would she not feel pain for the doomed souls cowering under her son's arm upraised in righteous wrath? Could she free herself from responsibility for him, even though he were the son of God? She had carried him in her womb for nine months, given him the breast, healed his wounds. Her son was judging other mothers' sons! The good would be saved, the saints return to heaven; but the elect seemed so few in comparison to the endless hordes of sinners. Everything her son did was perfection; yet she could not help but be anguished at the awful suffering that must follow.</p>

  <p class="normal">Charles V did not come to Rome, but instead prepared a fleet to sail from Barcelona against the Barbary pirates. The Florentine exiles sent a delegation to him, urging him to appoint Cardinal Ippolito as ruler of Florence. Charles received the delegation in encouraging terms... but delayed his decision until he should have returned from the wars. When Ippolito heard the news he decided to join Charles in his expedition and fight by the Emperor's aide. At Itri, where he was waiting to board ship, he was poisoned by one of Alessandro's agents and died instantly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Florentine colony was plunged into the profoundest gloom. For Michelangelo the loss was especially poignant; in Ippolito be had found everything he had loved in Ippolito's father, Giuliano. It left him with only Contessina's son to carry on the continuity of his love for the Medici. Niccolò seemed to feel the same way, for they sought each other's company during the dread-filled days.</p>

  <p class="normal">By fall, one year after he had reached Rome, his Sistine wall was rebricked and dried; his cartoon of more than three hundred "men of all races," as Matthew had put it, ready to be blown up to wall size. Pope Paul, wishing to give him security, issued a <i>breve </i>which declared Michelangelo Buonarroti to be the <i>Sculptor, Painter and Architect of All the Vatican, </i>with a lifetime pension of a hundred ducats a month, fifty from the papal treasury, fifty from the benefice of the ferry over the Po River at Piacenza. Sebastiano del Piombo stood with him before the scaffold in the Sistine, asking eagerly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Would you like me to put the intonaco on, <i>compare? </i>I'm an expert."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a tedious job, Sebastiano. Are you sure you want to?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would be proud to say that I had a hand in the Last Judgment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"All right. But don't use Roman <i>pozzolana, </i>it stays soft; put in marble dust instead, and not too much water with the lime."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will lay you a flawless surface."</p>

  <p class="normal">So he did, structurally; but the moment Michelangelo approached the altar he smelled something wrong: Sebastiano had mixed mastic and resin with the lime, brewed them together, applied the plaster with a mason's trowel heated over fires.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Sebastiano, you have prepared this wall for oil paints!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Isn't that what you wanted?" Sebastiano asked innocently.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You know I work in fresco!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"But you didn't tell me, Godfather. I did our San Pietro in Montorio wall in oil."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo surveyed the Venetian from the crown of his bald head through the middle layers of his now frightened fat.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And that made you qualified to paint part of this wall...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I only wanted to help."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...to paint the Last Judgment?" Michelangelo's voice was rising. "Since you know how to work only in oil, you prepared an oil wall so that you could collaborate with me. What else have you done?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Well, I... I spoke to Pope Paul. He knows I am of your <i>bottega. </i>You've been complaining that I don't paint any more. Here is your opportunity..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"To throw you out!" shouted Michelangelo. "I ought to pull the entire plaster down over your ungrateful head."</p>

  <p class="normal">But even as Sebastiano scurried away, Michelangelo knew that the surface would take days, weeks to scrape off. Then the brick wall would have to be allowed to dry again before a genuine fresco base could be laid. It, too, would take time to dry. Sebastiano had wasted months of his time.</p>

  <p class="normal">The wall would be repaired by the capable Urbino; but the breach caused between Michelangelo and Antonio da Sangallo by Pope Paul's <i>breve </i>would last for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p class="normal">Antonio da Sangallo, now fifty-two years old, decorated his thin face with a replica of his uncle Giuliano's luxuriant oriental mustache. He had joined Bramante as an apprentice on St. Peter's and, after Bramante's death, had worked as an assistant to Raphael. He had been part of the Bramante-Raphael clique that had attacked the Sistine value. Since Raphael's death, with the exception of a few years when Baldassare Peruzzi of Siena had been forced on him as co-architect by Pope Leo, Sangallo had been the architect of St. Peter's, and of Rome. For fifteen years, while Michelangelo was working in Carrara and Florence, no one had risen to challenge his supremacy.... The Pope's <i>breve </i>made him raving mad.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso first brought the warning that Sangallo was growing increasingly violent.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's not so much that he fights your being named the official sculptor and painter of the Vatican palace. He laughs that off as a colossal piece of bad judgment. It's the appointment as official architect that has him half out of his mind."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't ask Pope Paul to put that in the <i>breve."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"You could never convince Sangallo of that. He claims you're conniving to take St. Peter's away from him."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What St. Peter's? Those piers and foundations he's been pouring for fifteen years?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sangallo showed up that very night, accompanied by two of his apprentices who lighted him across the Piazza del Foro Traiano. Michelangelo invited them in, tried to propitiate Sangallo by recalling memories of their early days together in his uncle's house in Florence. Sangallo refused to be placated.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I should have come here the very day I heard you had made accusations against me to Pope Paul. It was the same kind of wicked slander you used against Bramante."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I told Pope Julius that Bramante's mix was bad and that the piers would crack. Raphael spent years repairing them. Is that not true?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You think you can turn Pope Paul against me. You demanded that he declare you the Vatican architect. You want to push me out!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is not true. I am concerned for the building. The fabric has already been paid for, and no part of the church proper is yet apparent."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Listen to the great architect talk! I've seen that miserable dumpy dome you inflicted on the Medici chapel." Sangallo pressed his clenched fists against his bosom. "Get your bashed-in nose out of St. Peter's. You've been a meddler in other people's affairs all your life. Even Torrigiani couldn't teach you any better. If you value your life: <i>St. Peter's is mine!"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Angry for the first time, distressed at the mention of Torrigiani's name, Michelangelo compressed his lips, replied coldly:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not quite. It was mine in its inception, and it may very well be mine in its completion."</p>

  <p class="normal">Now that Sangallo had announced open warfare, Michelangelo decided he had better see Sangallo's walk-in model. Tommaso arranged to take him to the office of the commissioners of St. Peter's where it was lodged. They went on a religious holiday when no one would be there.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was aghast at what he saw. Bramante's interior in the form of a simple Greek cross had been clean and pure, full of light and isolated from its surroundings. Sangallo's model included a ring of chapels which deprived Bramante's concept of all its light and provided none of its own. There were so many ranges of columns one upon the other, so many innumerable projections, pinnacles and subdivisions that the former serene tranquillity was lost. Sangallo had been building fortresses and defense walls; he had no sense whatever of how to create a spiritual church, one that was envisaged as the Mother Church of Christendom. If Sangallo were allowed to continue, he would erect a heavy monument, cluttered and in bad taste.</p>

  <p class="normal">Walking home, Michelangelo said ruefully to Tommaso:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was wrong to tell the Pope about the waste of money. That is the least of the danger."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then you will say nothing?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's clear from your voice, Tommaso, that you hope I won't. In point of fact, the Pope would tell me, 'This puts you in a bad light.' So it would. But St. Peter's will be as dark as a Stygian cave."</p>

  <p class="chapter">6.</p>

  <p class="normal">All the Last Judgments he had seen had been sentimental, unrealistic child's tales, rigid, without movement, stratified as much in space as in spiritual category, with an aloof still-life Christ sitting on a throne, his Judgment already passed. Michelangelo had always searched for the moment of decision, which was for him the eternal womb of truth: David, before the battle with Goliath; God, before giving the spark of life to Adam; Moses, before sustaining the Israelites. Now too he sought a Last Judgment not yet made, with Christ arriving on the scene in a burst of force, while all the nations of earth and time made their way toward him wondering in the starkest fear:</p>

  <p class="normal">"What is to happen to me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">This would be the most powerful of all his Christs; he made him Zeus and Hercules, Apollo and Atlas, while realizing it was he, Michelangelo Buonarroti, who would be judging the nations of men. He pulled back into space the right leg of Christ, even as he had the Moses, to cause an unbalance of weight and set the whole figure in a state of tension. The wall would be dominated by Christ's <i>terribilità, </i>his terrifying awesomeness.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the vault he had painted his Genesis in bright, dramatic colors; the Last Judgment would be confined to quieter monotones, flesh tones and brown. On the ceiling he had worked in sharply delineated panels; with the Last Judgment he would have to perform the magician's trick of making the wall vanish and infinite space appear.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, ready to begin the fresco itself, all feeling of spent years, of fatigue and uncertainty about the future, vanished. Comfortable and warmed by his love for Tommaso, confident in the pursuit of his love for Vittoria, he tackled the wall with vigor.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tommaso, how can a man be happy painting the judgment of the world when so pitifully few will be saved?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Because it's not the damnation itself that your happiness derives from. Ecclesia supporting the young girl in her lap, and this condemned sinner, are as fine as anything you painted on the vault."</p>

  <p class="normal">He was attempting to capture naked truth through nakedness, to express everything the human figure could articulate. His Christ would wear a wisp of the loincloth, the Virgin a pale lilac robe; yet as he painted her beautiful legs he could bring himself to veil them with only the sheerest of lilac-colored silk. All the rest, men, women, children, angels, were nude. He was painting them as God made them... and as he had wanted to paint them from the age of thirteen. He eschewed conventional iconography to achieve his emotional responses; there was little of the ritualistic vocabulary of religious painting. He did not conceive of himself as a religious painter, or of the Last Judgment as a religious fresco. It was spiritual, having to do with the eternality of the human soul, with the power of God to make man judge himself and hold himself accountable for his sins. He portrayed a single naked humanity struggling with the same fate, the peoples of all races. Even the Apostles and saints, holding forth their symbols of martyrdom, frightened lest they not be recognized, seemed stunned by this image of Christ, the "most high Jupiter," as Dante described him, about to cast fierce thunderbolts at the guilty.</p>

  <p class="normal">By day he locked himself into the world of the Sistine, with only Urbino by his side on the high scaffold, painting first in the lunettes from which he had obliterated his early work. Just below was the figure of Christ, on the rock of heaven, the golden sun for a throne behind him. Standing on the floor of the chapel, looking upward, he felt a need to impart greater visual impact to Christ's raised arm. He ascended the scaffold, added more volume by extending the paint beyond the outline delineated in the wet plaster. Then he painted Mary beside Christ, the hordes of humans on either side.</p>

  <p class="normal">At night he read the Bible, Dante, and Savonarola's sermons sent to him by Vittoria Colonna; all fitted together as parts of a whole. He could hear Savonarola's voice as he read sermons he had heard the friar preach forty years before. Now, even as Vittoria had told him, the martyred priest stood forth in his full glory as a prophet. Everything that Fra Savonarola had predicted had come true: the division within the Church; the setting up of a new faith within the framework of Christianity; the low estate of the papacy and the clergy; the decay of morals, the increase of violence:</p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">Rome, a mighty war shall strip thee of thy pomp and pride, a mighty pestilence make ye cast aside your vanities.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">Behold, O Florence, thy fate, if thou wouldst have a tyrant. Thy tongue enslaved, thy person subject to him, thy goods at his disposal... debased in all ways.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">On the outside, it looked as though Judgment Day had arrived for Pope Paul. Cardinal Niccolò, now one of the most influential cardinals at court, brought the news to Michelangelo: Charles V of Spain and Francis I of France had once again declared war on each other. Charles was traveling north from Naples with his army, the one that had sacked Rome and crushed Florence. Pope Paul had no army or means of resistance; he was preparing to flee.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But where?" demanded Tommaso hotly. "To Sant'Angelo, while Charles's troops pillage again? We cannot stand another sack; we will become just another pile of stones, like Carthage."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What will he fight with?" Michelangelo asked. "I watched the Emperor's army beyond the San Miniato walls. They have cannon, cavalrymen, lancers.... What would you use to defend yourselves?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Our bare hands!" Tommaso was livid with rage, the first time Michelangelo had ever seen him this way.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul decided to fight... with peace and grandeur. He received the Emperor on the steps before St. Peter's, surrounded by the hierarchy of the Church in their splendid robes, and three thousand valiant young Romans. Charles behaved graciously, accepted the Pope's spiritual authority. The following day he called on Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa di Pescara, friend of his family, who summoned her friend, Michelangelo Buonarroti, for the meeting in the garden of San Silvestro al Quirinale.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Holy Roman Emperor, a formal and haughty monarch, acknowledged Vittoria's introduction with considerable sanguinity. Michelangelo pleaded with Charles for the removal of Alessandro as the tyrant of Florence. The Emperor did not appear to be greatly interested but, when Michelangelo had concluded, leaned toward him and said with unaccustomed heartiness:</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can promise you one thing when I get to Florence."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thank you, Excellency."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That I shall pay a visit to your new sacristy. People of my court, returning to Spain, have declared it one of the marvels of the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo looked toward Vittoria to see if he might continue. Vittoria's face was calm; she was willing to risk the Emperor's displeasure to allow Michelangelo to speak for his country.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Excellence, if the sculptures of the new sacristy are good, they are so because I was raised in the art capital of Europe. Florence can continue to create noble works of art only if you rescue her from under the boot of Alessandro."</p>

  <p class="normal">Charles maintained his pleasant mien, murmuring, "The Marchesa di Pescara says that you are the single greatest artist since the beginning of time. I have seen your Sistine Chapel ceiling; in a few days I shall see your Medici chapel sculptures. If they are all that I have heard, you have our royal promise... something shall be done."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Florentine colony ran wild with joy. Charles V kept his word; he was so deeply stirred by his visit to the new sacristy that he ordered the wedding ceremonies of his daughter Margaret to Alessandro to be held in Michelangelo's chapel. The prospect made Michelangelo so ill he could not work. He walked in the <i>campagna </i>along the tomb-lined Via Appia, revulsion sweeping over him as he tried to vomit forth the noxious nature of the existing world.</p>

  <p class="normal">The marriage proved to be short-lived; Alessandro was murdered in a house next to the Medici palace by a Popolano cousin, Lorenzino, when he thought he was keeping a tryst with Lorenzino's chaste sister. Florence was freed of its rapacious tyrant; but not Michelangelo. Alessandro's body, loathsome to all of Tuscany, was clandestinely dumped in the dark of night into the chastely sculptured sarcophagus under Dawn and Dusk.</p>

  <p class="normal">"All Florentines are rid of Alessandro... except me," he said to Urbino morosely. "Now you see what a marble carver is good for: to provide tombs for tyrants."</p>

  <p class="normal">Revulsion passes, as joy does. Each bad blow kept him out of the Sistine for a week or two. Such good news as the marriage of his niece, Cecca, to the son of the famous Florentine historian, Guicciardini, or the election of Vittoria Colonna's father confessor and teacher, Reginald Pole, to the cardinalate, which gave a strong boost to the reform faction, sent him back renewed to paint the compact group of saints pictorially beyond Christ's wrath: Catherine, with part of a wheel, Sebastiano, with a handful of arrows, attenuated forms wafting upward in the armament, glorious female figures among the intermeshed maze of males. He used his spare energies to propitiate the still outraged Duke of Urbino by making a model of a bronze horse for him, as well as a richly decorated salt cellar. He took comfort from the fact that Cosimo de' Medici, a descendant of the Popolano branch of the Medici, a humble, decent seventeen-year-old, was in the Medici palace, and many of the exiles were returning home, the young sons of his friends coming to bid him an affectionate <i>A rivederci.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">He was shattered when the malign fates which had begun the enveloping of Florence since the untimely death of Lorenzo, <i>Il Magnifico, </i>moved on inexorably to inflict a culminating tragedy: Cosimo, though well behaved morally, was developing into a tyrant, reducing the newly elected councils to impotence. The young men of Florence organized an army, bought arms, appealed to Francis I of France to lend them troops to defeat Cosimo's supporters. Charles V did not want a republic; he loaned his army to Cosimo, who crushed the uprising. The leaders were executed, hundreds of the finest minds and spirits of Tuscany, with every family suffering severe losses: Filippo Strozzi run through with a sword, his son killed; Baccio Valori and his son put to death; a dozen more of the young exiles who had thronged his studio, who had been bold and eager to return and fight for their city-state, dead, dead in the beauty and glory of their youth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What was their sin?" Michelangelo cried. "For what were they judged, that they had to be murdered in cold blood? What kind of jungle do we live in that such brutal, senseless crime can be committed with impunity?"</p>

  <p class="normal">How right he had been to put up on that wall a fierce and wrathful Jesus on Judgment Day!</p>

  <p class="normal">He redrew the lower right-hand corner of his cartoon, opposite the dead arising from their graves on the left; and for the first time pictured a group already condemned, being driven by Charon into the mouth of hell. Now man seemed just another form of animal life cropping his way along the surface of the earth. Was he possessed of an immortal soul? Precious little good it had done him: it was just another appendage he was going to have to carry down to the inferno with him. Perhaps this soul would help him to climb back up to purgatory, and eventually even to paradise. At the moment he would have said, "Permit me to doubt"... for Vittoria Colonna too had come into troubled times.</p>

  <p class="normal">Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, long suspicious of her activities as an inquirer into new doctrines and a challenger of the faith, had been elected a cardinal. A religious fanatic, Cardinal Caraffa began his efforts to bring the Inquisition into Italy to wipe out the heretics, the freethinkers, the unbelievers... and in the case of Vittoria Colonna, those who were working from outside the Church to oblige the Church to reform itself from within. He made it plain that he considered her, and the little group around her, dangerous. Though they rarely had more than eight or nine at their meetings, there was an informer in their midst; Cardinal Caraffa had a complete record by Monday morning of the Sunday afternoon discussions.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What will this mean to you?" Michelangelo asked Vittoria anxiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing, so long as some of the cardinals are in favor of reform."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But if Caraffa gains control?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Exile."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo was shocked. He stared at her alabaster face, himself turning pale.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Should you not be careful?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The thought had made his voice harsh. Was he asking it for her, or for himself? She knew how important her presence in Rome was to him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It would do no good. I might issue the same warning to you." Her voice too seemed sharp. Was she asking it for herself, for him? Had she not shown him that she wanted him near? "Caraffa does not like what you are painting in the Sistine."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How could he know? I keep it locked."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The same way he knows what we say here."</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he had allowed no one but Urbino, Tommaso and the Cardinals Niccolò and Giovanni Salviati into his studio since he had begun blowing up his cartoon, and not a solitary soul but Urbino into the Sistine, Cardinal Caraffa was not the only one who knew what he was putting on the wall. Letters began to arrive from all over Italy, commenting on it. The strangest came from Pietro Aretino, whom Michelangelo knew by reputation as a gifted writer and unscrupulous wretch who lived by blackmail, obtaining the most astounding favors and sums of money, even from princes and cardinals, by showing them how much damage he could do by flooding Europe with evil letters about them, couched in such vivid and witty terms that the courts of Europe repeated his slanders as amusing anecdotes. Sometimes cast down by his greed and concupiscence into poverty and disgrace, he was at the moment a man of importance in Venice, ultimate friend of Titian and consort of kings.</p>

  <p class="normal">The purpose of Aretino's letter was to tell Michelangelo exactly how he should paint the Last Judgment:</p>

  <p class="versi">I see in the crowd the Antichrist with features which you alone could imagine: I see terror on the countenances of the living. I see the signs of the extinction of the sun, moon and stars; I see the elements melt and disappear, and I see exhausted Nature become sterile.... I see life and death scared by the fearful anarchy.... I see the arrowy flight of the words of judgment, issuing from the mouth of the Son of God, amidst tremendous thunderings....</p>

  <p class="normal">Aretino ended his long letter with the comment that, although he had vowed never to return to Rome, his resolve was broken by the desire to pay honor to Michelangelo's genius. Michelangelo answered satirically, thinking to rid himself of the interloper:</p>

  <p class="versi">Do not change your decision not to come to Rome just for the sake of seeing my work. That would be asking too much! When I received your letter I rejoiced; yet I grieved at the same time because, since I have completed a large section of my story, I cannot put to use your conception.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aretino began a barrage of letters which importuned drawings, sections of cartoons, models: "Does not my devotion deserve that I should receive from you, the prince of sculpture and of painting, one of those cartoons which you fling into the fire?" He even sent missives to Michelangelo's friends, to young Vasari whom he had known in Venice, and others who frequented the studio on the Macello dei Corvi, determined to have their help in getting some of the sketches which he could then sell. Michelangelo answered evasively, grew bored and ignored Aretino completely.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was an error: Aretino saved his venom until the Last Judgment was completed, then struck with two inky ejaculations, one of which almost destroyed his five years of painting, the second, his character.</p>

  <p class="chapter">7.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now time and space became identical. He could not swear how many days, weeks, months passed as 1537 gave way to 1538, but before him on the altar wall he could tell precisely how many figures he had floating upward through the lower cloud levels to the rocky crags on either side of the Madonna and Son. Christ with his arm raised above his head in outraged denunciation was not here to listen to special pleading. No good for sinners to cry for mercy. The wicked were already damned, and terror was in the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet never were the forms of the human body more lovingly and pulsatingly portrayed. How could so mean a spirit live in so noble a castle? Why was the flesh so much more perfect in structure, power, beauty, than anything these frightened mortals had been able to accomplish with their minds and souls?</p>

  <p class="normal">Each morning Urbino laid the needed field of intonaco; by nightfall Michelangelo had filled it with a body tumbling downward toward hell, or the portraits of the now elderly Eve and Adam. Urbino had become as expert as Rosselli at joining each new day's plaster so that the lines could not be seen. Each day at noon he had the woman servant, Caterina, bring hot food which he reheated on a brazier on the scaffold before serving Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Mangiate bene, </span></i><span>eat well. You need your strength. It is a <i>torta, </i>like your stepmother used to bake, chicken fried in oil and ground into sausage with onions, parsley, eggs and saffron."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">"Urbino, you know I'm too wrought up to eat in the middle of a day's work."</p>

  <p class="normal">"...and too tired to eat at the end of one. Look what I have here, a salad that sings in the month."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo chuckled. To indulge Urbino, he ate, and was surprised at how good it was, how like <i>Il Migliore's. </i>Urbino was pleased with the success of his stratagem.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Michelangelo began to falter, after months of intensive work, it was Urbino who made him stay at home, rest, divert himself by massing the blocks for the Prophet, Sibyl and Virgin for the Roveres. When the Duke of Urbino died, Michelangelo was immensely relieved even though he knew he would have to confess the sin of rejoicing over another man's death. Before long the new Duke of Urbino arrived at the studio on the Macello dei Corvi. Michelangelo took one look at him standing in the doorway in his father's face.</p>

  <p class="txtIndent"><i><span>"Dio mio," </span></i><span>he thought, "I inherit the sons of my enemies as well as my friends."</span></p>

  <p class="normal">But he was wrong about the young duke.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have come to put an end to the strife," he said quietly. "I have never agreed with my father that your failure to complete my granduncle's tomb was totally your fault."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You mean that I can now call the Duke of Urbino my friend?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"And admirer. I often told my father if you had been allowed to continue your work you would have completed that tomb even as you did the Sistine Chapel and the Medici chapel. You shall be harassed no more."</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo sank into a chair. "My son, do you know from what you have just delivered me...?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"But by the same token," continued the young man, "you will readily understand our earnest wish to see you finish the holy monument to my uncle, Pope Julius. Because of the reverence we bear Pope Paul, we shall not interrupt you while you are completing your fresco; but, being finished, we ask that you give yourself to the monument, doubling your diligence to remedy the loss of time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"With all my heart! You shall have your tomb!"</p>

  <p class="normal">During the long winter nights he made drawings for Vittoria: a Holy Family, a Pietà, exquisitely conceived; while she returned his feelings by presenting him with a first copy of her published poems, <i>Rime. </i>For Michelangelo, desiring to pour out the whole of his passion, it was an incomplete relationship, yet his love for her, and his conviction that she felt deeply for him, kept his creative powers at the flood while he painted husky <i>contadini </i>angels on a floating bastion several clouds below Christ, blowing their trumpets with such hell-let-loose loudness that all the dead below would hear and rise from their graves.</p>

  <p class="normal">His brothers, his nephew Lionardo and his niece Cecca kept him posted on family affairs. Lionardo, approaching twenty, was showing the first profit at the family wool shop. Cecca presented him with a new nephew each year. Occasionally he had to write irritated letters to Florence, as when he received no acknowledgment of money sent, or when Giovansimone and Sigismondo quarreled over who should get how much wheat from which farm; or Lionardo, requested to send him some fine Florentine shirts, chose three which proved to be "so coarse a peasant couldn't wear them."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Lionardo sent good pears or <i>trebbiano </i>wine, Michelangelo took a portion to the Vatican to give to Pope Paul as a present. They had become fast friends. If a long period went by without Michelangelo's visiting him, Paul summoned him from his work to come to the throne room, asking in an injured tone:</p>

  <p class="normal">"Michelangelo, why do you never come to see me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holy Father, you do not need my presence here. I believe that I serve you better by remaining at work than do others who stand before you all day."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The painter Passenti presents himself here every day."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Passenti has an ordinary talent that can be found without a lantern in the market places of the world."</p>

  <p class="normal">Paul was proving to be a good Pope; he appointed honorable and able men as cardinals, was dedicated to reform within the Church. Though he found it necessary to pose the authority of the Church against Charles's military power, he brought neither wars nor invasions down upon himself. He was devoted to the arts and learning. Nevertheless his heritage from the Borgia regime held over, making him a target for attack. As sentimentally attached to his sons and grandsons as the Borgia Pope had been to Caesar and Lucrezia, there was almost no piece of chicanery he considered despicable if it helped found the fortune of his son Pier Luigi, for whom he was determined to carve out a duchy. He appointed his fourteen-year-old grandson, Alessandro Farnese, a cardinal, and another young grandson he married to Charles V's daughter, the widow of Alessandro de' Medici, creating a place for him by taking the Duchy of Camerino away from the Duke of Urbino. Because of these acts his enemies called him base and ruthless.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the end of 1540, when Michelangelo had completed the upper two thirds of the fresco, he hired the carpenter Ludovico to lower the scaffolding. Pope Paul heard the news, arrived at the locked Sistine door unannounced. He had given up the use of his personal chapel so that Michelangelo might have his privacy. Urbino, who answered the banging on the door, could not refuse to admit the pontiff.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo came down from the new, low scaffold, greeted Pope Paul and his Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, with cordial words. The Pope stood facing the Last Judgment, walked stiffly toward the wall without removing his eyes. When he reached the altar he sank to his knees and prayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Not so Biagio da Cesena, who stood glaring up at the fresco. Paul rose to his feet, made the sign of the cross over Michelangelo and then the Last Judgment. There were tears of pride and humility on his cheeks.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My son, you have created a glory for my reign."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It is disgraceful...!" spat out Biagio da Cesena.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pope Paul was astounded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And totally immoral! I cannot tell the saints from the sinners. There are only hundreds of nudes showing their private parts. It is shameful."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You think the human body shameful?" asked Michelangelo.</p>

  <p class="normal">"In a <i>bagno, </i>bath, no. But in the Pope's chapel! <i>Scandaloso!"</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"Only if you wish to create a scandal, Biagio," replied Paul firmly. "On Judgment Day we shall all stand naked before the Lord. My son, how do I express my overwhelming gratitude?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned to the Master of Ceremonies with a conciliatory gesture, for he wanted to make no enemies for his fresco. Biagio da Cesena broke in roughly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"One day this sacrilegious wall will be annihilated, even as you destroyed the beautiful Peruginos beneath it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not while I live," cried Pope Paul, furious. "I will excommunicate anyone who dares touch this masterpiece!"</p>

  <p class="normal">They left the chapel. Michelangelo stood rubbing a sorely painful area under his left breast. He asked Urbino to mix some intonaco and lay it on the blank spot on the extreme lower right-hand corner of the wall. This done, he painted a caricature of Biagio da Cesena, representing him as the judge of the shades of Hades, with the ears of an ass, and a monstrous snake coiled around the lower part of the torso: a lethal likeness, the pointed nose, lips drawn back over buck teeth. It was a poor revenge, he knew, but what other was open to an artist?</p>

  <p class="normal">Word leaked out somehow. Biagio da Cesena demanded a second meeting before the fresco.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You see, Holy Father," cried the Master of Ceremonies, "the report was true. Buonarroti has painted me into the fresco. With some kind of repulsive serpent for my genitalia."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a covering," replied Michelangelo. "I knew you would not want to be portrayed wholly naked."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A remarkable likeness," observed the Pope, his eyes twinkling. "Michelangelo, I thought you said you could not do portraiture?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was inspired, Holiness."</p>

  <p class="normal">Biagio da Cesena hopped up and down on either foot as though it were he instead of his picture standing over the fires of hell.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Holiness, make him take me out of there!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Out of hell?" the Pope turned surprised eyes on the man. "Had he placed you in purgatory, I should have done everything in my power to release you. But you know that from hell there is no redemption."</p>

  <p class="normal">The following day Michelangelo learned that no one ever got the last laugh. He was on the lowered scaffolding painting Charon with the protruding eyes and horns for ears, whipping the damned out of his boat and into the fiery depths, when he felt dizzy, tried to grasp a support rail, fell to the marble floor. There was a moment of excruciating pain. He revived to find Urbino splashing cold, sandy water from the bucket onto his face.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thanks to God, you're conscious. How badly are you hurt? Is anything broken?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"How would I know? If I'm so stupid, I should have broken every bone in my body. For five years I work on this scaffold, and at the very end I fall off."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Your leg is bleeding where it struck this piece of lumber. I will find a carriage."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You'll find nothing of the sort. Nobody is going to know what an idiot I am. Help me up. Now put an arm under my shoulder. I can ride the horse home."</p>

  <p class="normal">Urbino put him to bed, pressed a glass of <i>trebbiano </i>to his lips, then washed out the wound. When he wanted to go for a doctor Michelangelo stopped him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No doctor. I'd be the laughingstock of Rome. Bolt that front door."</p>

  <p class="normal">Despite all that Urbino could do by way of hot towels and bandaging, the wound began to fester. Michelangelo developed a fever. Urbino was frightened and sent word to Tommaso.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If I let you die..."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The thought has its compensations, Urbino. I wouldn't have to go climbing scaffolds any more."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can you tell? Perhaps in hell a man has to do forever the thing he most hated to do in life?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Tommaso went for Dr. Baccio Rontini. When Michelangelo refused to allow them to enter the front door they forced a back door of the house. Dr. Rontini was irate.</p>

  <p class="normal">"For sheer perverse idiocy, no one can rival a Florentine." He probed the infected wound. "Another day or two..."</p>

  <p class="normal">It took a week to get him back on his feet; he felt like a bag of meal. Urbino helped him up the scaffolding, laid a patch of intonaco in the sky just below St. Bartholomew. Michelangelo painted a caricature of his own drained, woebegone face and head, suspended in the middle of an empty skin, and held aloft by the hand of the saint.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now Biagio da Cesena doesn't have to feel too badly," he observed to Urbino as he gazed at his empty, hanging carcass. "We're both been judged, and recorded."</p>

  <p class="normal">He painted the bottom third of the wall, the simplest part since there were fewer figures: the symbolic graveyards and hell, with the long dead rising from their tombs, one of them a skeleton trying to join those in the sky; and the too long alive, being driven into the fires.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was at this moment mat Vittoria's troubles came to a crisis. The most influential and talented of women, praised by the great Ariosto for her poetry, by the Pope for her saintliness; the closest friend of Emperor Charles V in Rome, a member of the wealthy Colonnas, and the D'Avalos by marriage, she was nonetheless about to be driven into exile by Cardinal Caraffa. It seemed impossible that a woman of such high position could be so persecuted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo called on Cardinal Niccolò at the Medici palace to ask for help. Niccolò tried to reassure him.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Everyone in Rome now acknowledges the need for reform. My uncles Leo and Clement were too highhanded, they tried to bring the dissenters back by disciplining them. But Paul is sending the marchesa's friend, Cardinal Contarini, to negotiate with the Lutherans and Calvinists. I think we shall succeed in time."</p>

  <p class="normal">Cardinal Contarini was on the verge of a brilliant success at the Diet of Ratisbon when Cardinal Caraffa had him recalled, accused him of collusion with Emperor Charles V, and had him exiled to Bologna.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vittoria sent Michelangelo a message; could he come at once? She wished to say "Farewell."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was an intoxicating April day, the buds bursting forth in the Colonna gardens, the wild scents of spring enclosed within the walls. Michelangelo had expected to find her alone for so personal a moment, but the garden was full of people. She rose, greeting him with a somber smile. She was dressed in black, a black mantilla covering the golden hair; her face seemed carved out of Pietrasanta statuary marble. He went close to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was good of you to come, Michelangelo."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let us not waste time on the formalities. You have been exiled?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I have been given to understand that it would be advisable to leave Rome."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"To Viterbo. I lived in the convent of St. Catherine there. I consider it one of my homes."</p>

  <p class="normal">"When will I see you again?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"When God wills."</p>

  <p class="normal">They stood in silence, probing deep into each other's eyes, trying to communicate.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm sorry, Michelangelo, that I shall not be able to see your Last Judgment."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You will see it. When do you leave?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"In the morning. You will write to me?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will write, and send you drawings."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I will answer, and send you poems."</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned abruptly and left the garden; locked himself in the studio of his house, bereft. It was dark by the time he roused himself from his torpor and asked Urbino to light him to the Sistine. In the Florentine district oil lamps were glowing in the windows of the houses. The Castel Sant'Angelo loomed up at the other end of the bridge like a cylindrically carved stone mountain. Urbino unlocked the Sistine door, went ahead with the taper to let warm wax drip onto the scaffolding and make a base for the two candles he was carrying.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Last Judgment sprang cyclonically to life in the flickering half-world of the chapel. Judgment Day became Judgment Night. The three hundred men, women, children, saints, angels and demons, many of whom had been submerged in the full light of day, pressed forward to be recognized and to play out their portentous drama in the open spaces of the chapel itself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Something drew his attention to the ceiling. Looking upward, he saw God creating the universe. Lines from Genesis came into his mind:</p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">The earth yielded grasses that grew and seeded, each according to its kind, and trees that bore fruit, each with the power to propagate its own kind. And God saw it, and found it good.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">God made the two great luminaries, the greater of them to command the day, and the lesser to command the night; then he made the stars. All these he put in the vault of the sky, to shed their light on the earth, to control day and night, and divide the spheres of light and darkness. And God saw it, and found it good.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">So God made man in his own image, made him in the image of God. Man and woman both, he created them.</span></p>

  <p class="block2indent"><span class="calibre10">And God saw all that he had made, and found it very good.</span></p>

  <p class="normal">Michelangelo turned his attention back to his painting on the altar wall. He saw all that he had made, and he found it very good.</p>
