  <h2>6</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>H</b>elen flew back to Boston that same evening. She had planned to stay the weekend with friends in New York but she called them from the airport and made some excuse about having to get home. In truth, she simply wanted to get out of the stifle and clamor of Manhattan.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">The rest of the lunch had been better. Her father gave her a beautiful Italian leather purse that Courtney had helped him choose. Courtney had a present for her too, a bottle of perfume, and redeemed herself vastly in Helen’s estimation by eating a giant slice of chocolate gateau.</p>

  <p class="normal">To her father’s obvious pleasure, the two women had even kissed goodbye, with Helen undertaking to be in Barbados for the wedding, though refusing flatly to be a bridesmaid. Not even Matron of Dishonor, she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was getting on for ten o’clock by the time she’d driven down from Boston and swung east onto Route 6, which would take her all the way up the Cape to Wellfleet.</p>

  <p class="normal">In her haste to get out of New York, she had forgotten it was a Friday night, when the going was always slowest. Most of the way it was bumper to bumper with weekenders and tourists, their car roofs stacked high with bicycles, boats and boogie boards. Helen longed for the fall when the place would empty out and even more for winter when the wind roared across the bay and you could walk the ocean shore for mile upon mile and the only living things you saw were birds.</p>

  <p class="normal">The house she had lived in for the last two years was a rental on the bay side, a mile or so south of Wellfleet village. She still thought of it as Joel’s house. To reach it you had to leave the highway and negotiate a labyrinth of narrow, wooded lanes, then a steep dirt trail that led down to the water.</p>

  <p class="normal">Driving through the woods, away from the traffic at last, Helen turned off the air-conditioning of the ancient Volvo station wagon and wound down the window to get the warm smell of the woods. It was probably no cooler than New York, but the heat here was different, the air clean and there was nearly always a breeze.</p>

  <p class="normal">The car bumped its way down the trail until she could see the black expanse of water below her through the trees and the three small houses she had to pass before the final descent to her own. She stopped beside her mailbox but there was nothing in it. He hadn’t written for over a month.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a light still on at the Turners’ who looked after Buzz when she was away. She could hear him barking a welcome as she pulled up outside. He was inside the screen door of the kitchen, wagging his tail and watching her. Mrs Turner appeared and let him out.</p>

  <p class="normal">Buzz was a neutered scruff of uncertain parentage that Helen had got from a dog pound in Minneapolis, the Christmas before she met Joel. Which, except for her father and an ill-tempered hamster - one of the menagerie of pets Helen had kept as a child - made it the longest relationship with a male she had ever had. His coat was shaggy now, which made nonsense of his name. When she’d first laid eyes on him, he’d had an all-over crew-cut to rid him of a frightful infestation. Covered in blotches of purple disinfectant, he’d been, without even a close rival, the ugliest dog in the pound. Helen simply had to have him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hiya Trouble. How’re you doing? Get down now, get down.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Buzz jumped into the car and waited in the passenger seat while Helen thanked Mrs Turner and chatted for a minute or two about the horrors of summer in the city. Then she and Buzz drove down the last quarter of a mile of bumps and potholes to the house.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a big old place, clad in rotting white clapboard that rattled when the wind blew, as it often did, from the west. It stood on its own like a beached liner at the water’s edge, overlooking a marshy inlet of the bay. It seemed yet more like a ship inside, its every wall, floor and ceiling paneled in narrow, darkly varnished tongue and groove. Upstairs, twin gable windows surveyed the bay like portholes. The bridge of the ship was a long bay window in the living room where at high water you could look out and imagine you were at last afloat and setting sail for the Massachusetts mainland.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen could happily stand at that window all day, if she let herself, watching the weather rearrange the shapes and colors of the bay like a restless, perfectionist painter. She loved the way the wind and clouds made traveling patterns through the marsh grass and how, when the tide slid out, the air filled with a salty, primordial tang and the mud flats hummed and scuttled with armies of fiddler crabs.</p>

  <p class="normal">The time-switch light above the back door was on and a welcome-home party of bugs was whirring around it, casting shadows five times their size on the stoop. Helen dumped her bag outside the door She would take a quick walk along the shore to give Buzz a run She was tired, but the kind of tired you get from sitting in a plane and a car too long. It was also an excuse to delay going inside. The house seemed so big and silent now that it was only she and the dog who lived there.</p>

  <p class="normal">She walked down the curve of broken boardwalk and then down the steps to the strip of sand that ran beside the marsh grass all the way to the end of the inlet.</p>

  <p class="normal">The breeze felt good on her face and she took the salt air deep into her lungs. Across the bay she could see the lights of some small boat heading out on the tide. A waning moon was looking for gaps among the clouds, and when it found one, lit a path across the water. Buzz ran ahead, stopping now and then to pee or sniff the line of fresh debris that the tide had left.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Joel was around, they had taken this walk every night before turning in. And early on, in the days when they couldn’t keep their hands off each other for five minutes, they would stop and find a hollow in the dunes and make love, while Buzz went off on his own, foraging for crabs in the marsh grass or chasing birds he’d sprung, then coming back sodden and making them shriek by shaking himself all over them.</p>

  <p class="normal">About half a mile along the shore was the hull of an old yawl that someone had once perhaps intended to rebuild but that had now rotted beyond salvation. It had been hauled onto the shingle above the reach of all but the highest tides and lay tethered uselessly by moss-bearded ropes to two old trees. It was like the skeleton of some less ambitious Noah’s ark, abandoned by all but rats, to whom Buzz paid nightly visits. He was in there now, growling and scuffling in the dark. Helen sat on a driftwood log and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <div>
    &#160;<br/>
  </div>

  <div class="normal1">
    She and Buzz had first come to the Cape on vacation in early June the summer before last. Her sister had rented a house for the whole season, one of the million-dollar places set high above the water, with a stunning view over to Great Island and its own steep, wooden staircase down to the beach. She had invited Helen to stay.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Celia had married her college sweetheart, bright but boring Bryan, whose software company had just been bought out by a California computer giant for a mind-boggling amount of money. Even before that, they had been predictably happy and had produced, with no trouble at all, two perfect, blond children: a boy and a girl, Kyle and Carey. They lived in Boston, in a waterside development that, naturally, had won several design awards.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had spent most of the previous five years roughing it in the wilds of Minnesota and it took her awhile to get used to the luxury. The ‘guest suite’ at Celia’s Cape Cod rental even had its own jacuzzi. She had planned to stay for a week, then go back to Minneapolis to work on her thesis, for which her supervisor was already nagging. But the week became a fortnight, then the fortnight a month.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bryan would drive down each weekend from Boston to join them and once, for a few days, their mother and Ralphie came to stay, managing to break one of the beds. The rest of the time it was just Helen, Celia and the children. They got on well and it was good to have time to get to know the kids, though her sister remained the enigma she always had been.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nothing seemed to faze Celia. Not even Buzz eating her best straw hat. Her clothes were always clean and pressed, her figure trim, her hair washed and neatly bobbed. On those rare occasions when Kyle or Carey howled or threw a tantrum, she would just smile and soothe and hug them until they felt better. She did charity work, played elegant tennis and cooked like a dream. She could lay on an impromptu banquet for ten at half an hour’s notice. She never had headaches or sleepless nights or got grouchy with her period and even in the privacy of her own bathroom, Helen surmised, seldom, if ever, broke wind.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had long ago discovered there was little fun to be had in trying to shock her sister. It was impossible and anyway they were grown-ups now and you didn’t do that to someone who washed your underwear and brought you a cup of coffee in bed every morning. They talked to each other a lot, mainly about nothing, though just occasionally Helen would try to find out what Celia felt about the important things in life, or at least what she herself considered important.</p>

  <p class="normal">One night after supper, when Bryan wasn’t there and the kids were in bed, Helen asked her about their parents’ divorce. They were sitting at the table under the trees, finishing the wine which Helen, as usual, had drunk most of, and watching the sun sink beyond the island into the black band of the Massachusetts coast. She wanted to know if the divorce had been as traumatic for Celia as it had been for her.</p>

  <p class="normal">Celia shrugged. ‘Oh, I guess I always felt it was for the best.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But doesn’t it ever make you angry?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. That’s just the way they were. They wanted to stay together till we were old enough not to be too upset by it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And you weren’t “too upset” by it?’ Helen asked incredulously.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh sure. I was mad at them for awhile. But you can’t let these things get to you. It’s their life after all.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had persisted, trying to find some crack in what she thought might only be a protective veneer, but she couldn’t. Maybe it was true that this same event that had torn her own guts apart and sent her, in her love life at least, spiraling almost out of control for years, had left her sister untouched. Whatever, there was no point talking about it. But how strange, she thought, for two people with the same genes to be so different. Perhaps one of them had been swapped at birth.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a month of swimming, reading and playing with Kyle and Carey on the beach, Helen had grown restless. A friend of hers in Minneapolis had given her the number of a friend, called Bob, who was working at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, farther down the Cape, and one evening Helen called him.</p>

  <p class="normal">He sounded nice and asked her if she would like to come to a supper party he was holding that weekend. He and a few friends were going to be watching some ‘amazing footage’ that one of the Woods Hole guys had shot inside the womb of a sand tiger shark. It wasn’t exactly Helen’s idea of a great night out but what the hell, she thought, why not?</p>

  <p class="normal">She noticed Joel Latimer as soon as she walked in.</p>

  <p class="normal">He looked like one of those Californian surfbums from the sixties, tall and thin and tanned with a mop of sunbleached blond hair. He caught her staring at him while Bob was telling her about Woods Hole and he gave her such a direct smile she nearly spilled her wine.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a help-yourself-in-the-kitchen kind of dinner and Helen found herself at the vegetarian lasagne alongside him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So you’re the woman who runs with the wolves,’ he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Actually it’s more of a flat-footed shuffle.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He laughed. He had the bluest eyes and the whitest teeth she’d ever seen. She felt something contract in her stomach and told herself not to be ridiculous. He wasn’t even her type, though quite what was her type she’d never been quite sure. He helped her to some salad.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re on vacation here?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, I’m staying with my sister. Up at Wellfleet.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then we’re neighbors.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Joel was from North Carolina and she could hear it in his accent. His father ran a fishing business. He told her he was doing a PhD on horseshoe crabs, which he said weren’t really crabs at all, but arachnids, distant cousins of the spider. They were a kind of living fossil, ancient even when dinosaurs roamed the earth; they had been around for about four hundred million years without changing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sounds like my supervisor,’ she said. He laughed. God, she felt witty. Normally in the presence of good-looking men she either lost the power of speech or babbled like a loon. She asked him what the crabs looked like.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know those helmets the Nazis wore? Well, they’re like that, only brown. And inside it’s kind of like a scorpion.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Definitely like my supervisor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And it has this spiked tail sticking out the back.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He keeps his tucked away.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He told her that horseshoe blood had all kinds of important medical applications, was even used to diagnose and treat cancer. But they were a species under pressure and one of the problems here on the Cape was that eel fishermen killed them for bait. His research was to find out how serious an impact this was having on the local horseshoe populations. He lived in a big old rented place, just south of Wellfleet. It looked like a ship, he said. She must come by and visit.</p>

  <p class="normal">They took their food off to a corner and he told her who the other guests were and about the video they were going to see. She asked him how you got to shoot a movie inside the womb of a shark.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘With great difficulty.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I guess you have to find a really big shark—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Or a really small cameraman.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Right. Who’s also a gynecologist.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Later, watching it, sitting crammed on the couch between Joel and someone else, she wondered if he was as aware of the press of their bodies as she was. His jeans were torn and she couldn’t stop herself sneaking looks at the patch of tanned thigh that showed through.</p>

  <p class="normal">The guy who’d shot the video (who was of normal size) talked them through it, explaining that when a female sand tiger has mated, several fertilized egg capsules form in two separate wombs, developing rapidly into embryo sharks complete with teeth. In each womb, one shark fetus emerges as the strongest and then sets about murdering and devouring its brothers and sisters. Only these two are born, already well versed in the art of killing.</p>

  <p class="normal">As he talked, the tiny endoscope camera traveled the glutinous pink caves and tunnels of the mother shark, like a Steadicam in a cheap horror movie. You could see a swilling soup of dead baby sharks but no sign of the infant from hell who’d killed them all. Then, at the far end of the womb, a yellow eye suddenly surfaced in the soup, looking right at the camera and a room full of case-hardened biologists screamed in unison. In the laughter that followed, Helen was embarrassed to find she had grabbed hold of Joel’s arm. She quickly let it go.</p>

  <p class="normal">Afterward, Bob took her away to meet some other people and every so often she would glance across the room at Joel. And even though he was deep in conversation, he would see her and smile. When they said goodbye, he asked if she would like to meet some horseshoe crabs and, far too promptly, she said she would. He said how about tomorrow and she said fine.</p>

  <p class="normal">Within a week they were lovers and a week later Joel asked her to come and live with him. He said he felt he had known her forever, that they were ‘soul mates’, that if she moved in, they could spend the winter side by side, writing their theses. Helen had never heard anything so romantic in all her life. But men weren’t supposed to go around making such rash offers of commitment. So she said no, it was out of the question, ridiculous in fact; and the next morning moved in.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was as close to shocking Celia as she had ever come.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’re going to <i>live</i> with him?’ she said, watching her pack.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘After knowing him only two weeks?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sister, if a girl can’t find Mr Right, sometimes she’s got to settle for Mr Right Now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Since her parents’ divorce, she had stumbled from one bad affair to the next. Not that she’d been exactly promiscuous. Even if she’d wanted to be, that would have been tricky, living out in the wilds most of the year. It was just that she seemed to have this uncanny knack of picking the most unsuitable men available. There were exceptions, but mainly they were men that other women saw coming a hundred miles away, who had jerk or cheat or bastard written in neon letters on their foreheads, men she didn’t like or lust after but still somehow ended up with.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quite why she chose so badly, Helen had never been able to figure out. Perhaps she set her sights low because, deep down, she was sure no good man could ever possibly see anything in her. Not that the bad ones seemed to see much either, for it was rarely Helen who ended the affair, except when she sensed she was about to be dumped and managed to beat him to it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Normally, she stuck in there, even with the worst of them, trying to make it work, striving desperately for their approval, until they drifted off or started cheating on her or announced over a last, lousy dinner in a cheap restaurant, trying to break it gently, saying maybe, honey, we should call it a day.</p>

  <p class="normal">She’d never lived permanently with any of them. And so when Joel made his proposal, she went into a spin of panic. For weeks, she would wake up in the middle of the night with her heart pounding and an absolute certainty roaring in her head that tomorrow this gentle, golden man who lay warm and softly snoring beside her would tell her it had all been a mistake and would she please pack her bags, take her dog and get the hell out of his life.</p>

  <p class="normal">But it didn’t happen. And after awhile she relaxed. And soon it seemed as if they weren’t even separate people. She had read about such things in books but never believed it could be so. But it was. They often knew each other’s thoughts without need of words. They could spend a whole night talking or a whole day silent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Normally when people asked her about her work she would give a few jokey answers, putting it down, and would then switch the conversation around by asking questions of her own. Who could possibly be interested in what she did? But with Joel, it was different. You couldn’t deflect him. She found herself telling him more about her work than she had ever told anyone and he made her realize that her supervisor was right: she was good; hell, she was brilliant.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first time he told her he loved her, she didn’t know how to react. She just murmured and kissed him and the moment passed. She couldn’t bring herself to say it back, although it was true. Maybe he was the kind of man who said it to every woman he slept with. But that wasn’t all that restrained her. There seemed something fearfully final about saying it back, like joining two ends of a string to make a circle; she would be completing something. Ending it.</p>

  <p class="normal">But as fall gave way to winter and the Cape cleared of tourists and its skies of the great flocks of migrating birds, Helen found herself somehow clearing too. Free of doubt and self-consciousness, she came to accept what she and Joel had found. He loved her and she must therefore be lovable. He told her she was beautiful and for the first time in her life she truly felt she was. And though surely he must know it, why should she not now tell him that she loved him in return? So the second time he said it, she did.</p>

  <p class="normal">They moved the long kitchen table into the living room and arranged it by the big bay window, setting up their laptops and piling it high with papers. But little work got done. They talked too much or gazed too long at the wind scything spume from the gray waves of the bay. There was a wood stove which they kept going all the time and each day they took Buzz for long walks by the water’s edge in search of driftwood.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joel had a way with animals and the hitherto unruly Buzz was soon his devoted slave, sitting and staying to command and fetching sticks thrown seemingly impossible distances out into the surf. Helen watched in mounting panic while the poor dog got tossed and swamped and dragged under. She was convinced he would drown. But Joel just laughed. And soon, a bedraggled head would bob up somewhere in the foam, teeth clenched on the stick that, miraculously, he always managed to find and he would struggle back with it and drop it at Joel’s feet, begging for more.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joel had just discovered opera, which Helen had always claimed to hate. She groaned every time he put on a disc and even more when he sang along. Then he caught her one day humming something from <i>Tosca</i> in the bathtub and she was forced to admit that some of it was bearable. Not as good as Sheryl Crow, but not bad.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a bookcase stuffed by the landlords, inexplicably, with musty translations of Russian classics, books Joel said he had always meant to read but had never gotten round to. He started with Dostoevsky and moved rapidly on through Pasternak and Tolstoy to Chekhov, whom he discovered he liked best of all.</p>

  <p class="normal">He liked to cook and in the evenings, as he did so, he would tell her what was happening in the story, while she sat smiling and watched him work. They ate by the fire and afterward they would curl up together on the couch and read or talk about places they knew or wanted to know.</p>

  <p class="normal">He told her that when he was a kid, his father used to take all the kids crabbing at night. They’d row out into the bay, drop the pots, then come back and light a fire on the beach. Then they’d row out again and haul up the pots and his father would just empty them into the boat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It was only a little rowboat and we were all in swimsuits and no shoes or anything. And these crabs and lobsters were scuttling around in the dark over our feet in the bottom of the boat. God, we used to shriek.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Once, he said, they’d pulled up a pot and found a plastic bag with a bottle of whiskey in it and a note saying, <i>Thanks for the lobster!</i> Some people on a yacht must have left it, he said.</p>

  <p class="normal">She loved listening to his stories. Later they would make love, while the clapboard rattled and the salt wind moaned in the eaves.</p>

  <p class="normal">That winter, for the first time in years, snow fell heavily and stayed for the best part of a month. It was so cold that the bay froze over. From the frosted window, they watched it stretching away like tundra to a gray horizon. Joel said they were like Zhivago and Lara, marooned in their palace of ice. All they needed, he said, were some of her Minnesota wolves to howl for them at night.</p>

  <p class="normal">The spring and summer were the happiest of Helen’s life. They borrowed a dinghy and Joel taught her how to sail. Sometimes at night they would hike through the woods to a freshwater pond and swim naked. Their bodies undulated pale as muslin in the black water, still warm from the sun. They would hold each other and listen to the frogs and the muted roar of the ocean beyond the dunes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Instead of doing her own work Helen helped with his. Wolves now seemed to belong to a distant age, some desolate place in her past. This was her life now, this place with its teeming shores and vivid skies and air so full of salt and ozone it scoured the inside of your skull.</p>

  <p class="normal">That second fall, at last, she got down to work on her thesis. Just as he’d promised a year ago, they worked side by side in the big bay window. Sometimes they would spend a whole day discussing a problem one of them had run into. On other days they hardly spoke. Joel would go out to the kitchen and make tea and bring it to her at her desk and kiss the top of her head while she worked and she would kiss his hand and smile and go on with her work without a word being uttered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, subtly at first, things began to change. Joel grew quieter and corrected her sometimes when she was talking. He would criticize her for little things, how she’d left something unwashed in the sink or forgotten to turn off a light. It didn’t bother her too much, but she took note and tried not to make the same mistakes again.</p>

  <p class="normal">They had long disagreed about the issue that lay at the heart of Helen’s research: nature versus nurture. Joel believed the actions of any living creature were almost entirely conditioned by its genes, while Helen thought learning and circumstance often counted just as much. They had debated the subject endlessly and quite amicably. But now when it arose, Joel would get impatient and one evening he shouted at her and said she was stupid. He later apologized and Helen made light of it. But she felt shocked and hurt for days.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went to Celia’s for Christmas and Joel and Bryan got into an argument about a new catastrophe that was unfolding in Central Africa. Every TV news program was showing footage of hundreds of thousands of starving refugees, fleeing from tribal butchery through knee-deep mud and filth. A car-load of American aid workers had been ambushed and hacked to death with machetes. And watching the report from his leather recliner, in the big living room, Bryan said casually that he didn’t understand why we bothered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you mean?’ Joel said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen caught the tone of his voice from the hallway. She’d been reading the children a bedtime story and had just kissed them goodnight. Carey had asked her if she and Joel were going to get married and have babies and Helen had made a joke and avoided giving a proper answer.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bryan said, ‘Well, it’s none of our business, is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, what, we just let them all die?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘These guys have been killing each other for centuries, Joel.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does that make it okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. But it has nothing to do with us. In fact, I think it’s kind of patronizing for the West to get involved at all. You know, like we’re the civilized ones. We don’t even understand why these people are killing each other in the first place. And if you don’t understand it, you just end up making things worse.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How’s that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen was hovering in the doorway. Celia came out of the kitchen and made a face at her as she went past into the living room. She asked breezily if anyone wanted coffee, which meant, <i>Okay fellas, merry Christmas, that’s enough</i>. Both men declined.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We always end up backing the wrong side,’ Bryan said. Helen could see Joel nodding, as if considering what Bryan had said. He didn’t say a word and had an icy look in his eyes that she had never seen before. The TV news moved onto a story about a fifteen-foot python that had been found under an old couple’s house in Georgia. It had been living there happily for years and was only discovered after someone thought how remarkable it was that so many of the neighborhood’s dogs had gone missing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Bryan seemed a little disconcerted by Joel’s silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, what do you think?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joel looked at him for a moment then said quietly,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think you’re an idiot.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The holiday never quite recovered.</p>

  <p class="normal">They came back to the Cape and for awhile things seemed more or less normal. But, as the new year settled in, Helen became aware of a growing restlessness in him. She would look up from her computer and catch him staring into space. She could tell that little things she did irritated him, like when she tapped her nails on the keyboard while thinking something through.</p>

  <p class="normal">Soon she felt that everything she did was being silently judged and found wanting. He would suddenly get up and snatch his coat and say he was going for a walk and Helen would sit there, wondering what she had done and blaming herself. She would watch him from the window as he strode away along the shore, shoulders hunched against the wind, ignoring the sticks that Buzz dropped for him to throw, until the dog got the message that the game was a thing of the past.</p>

  <p class="normal">In bed one night, staring at the dark ceiling, Joel said he wanted to do something worthwhile with his life.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You don’t think what you’re doing at the moment is worthwhile?’ she said. He gave her a look and she quickly added, ‘I don’t mean, you know, <i>us</i>. I mean your work.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She meant both actually, but he took her at her word and said, sure, of course it was worthwhile, in its own way.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But saving a few crabs isn’t really going to change things. I mean, the oceans are dying, the whole planet’s being destroyed. Helen, all over the world people are starving and slaughtering each other and actually, when you think about it, what the hell am I doing? What the hell do a few crabs mean alongside all of that? It’s like fiddling while Rome burns.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She suddenly felt very cold. He made love to her, but it was different, as if he’d already gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">One night in late April, he told her over supper that he had applied to a foreign aid charity to go and work for them in Africa. They wanted to interview him. Helen tried not to look hurt.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh,’ she said. ‘That’s great.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. Well, you know. It’s just an interview.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He took another mouthful. He wouldn’t look her in the eyes. There was a pause in which Helen’s head screamed inside with accusation. She tried to find a tone of voice that wouldn’t show it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So, do they have starving crabs in Africa?’ The words just slipped out, she couldn’t help it. He looked at her. It was the first bitchy thing she’d ever said to him. She went on, trying to make it seem like a real question, ‘I mean, they need biology graduates, do they?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think the two years of med school I did maybe impresses them more,’ he said coldly.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was another long silence. He started to stack the plates.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You didn’t mention you were applying.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I wasn’t sure I wanted it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I mean, I’m not even sure now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">But she could tell he was. The following week he flew to Washington for the interview and they called the next day to say they wanted him to start in June. He asked Helen what she thought he should do and she told him what he wanted to hear. He should take it. Of course he should take it.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a long while before they could talk about it, or about anything else, come to that. Outside the air was growing warm. You could hear the call of piping plovers and see sanderlings again on the shore, playing their tireless tag with the waves. But, in the house, winter endured. They were clumsy with each other now, colliding in the cramped kitchen, whereas once they had known each other’s moves, effortlessly, like dancers. A cool politeness had settled, under which Joel stifled his guilt and she her anger.</p>

  <p class="normal">Reason told her she had no cause. God, it wasn’t as if they were married or had even discussed it as a possibility. Why shouldn’t he go and do something <i>worthwhile</i> with his life? It was fine. More, it was laudable. He was a ‘disperser’, that was all. It was ‘in his nature’.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then anger gave way and creeping upon her came that same old sense that, yet again, she had failed. But she knew it was worse, for this time she had not just sought to please but had opened every corner of herself. There was no part of her he didn’t know, nothing with which she could console herself and say, had he but seen this in me, then surely he never would or could have gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">She had given all and still been found wanting.</p>

  <p class="normal">In May, when the water warms along the Cape, the horseshoe crabs return in droves from their deep winter haunts. And when the sun and the moon align and the highest tides of the year flood in, they swarm to the shallows to breed.</p>

  <p class="normal">At this time, for the last two years, Joel had tagged several hundred of them, pressing numbered stainless-steel tacks into the rear of their shells. The idea was to see how many returned. Now, just a fortnight before he was due to leave for Africa, he planned to do it one last time.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tentatively, for that was how things now were between them, he asked if Helen would like to come along, as she had last year, to help. To show him how little (or how much) his departure bothered her, she had taken a job as a kitchen hand at Moby Dick’s, a seafood place out on the highway. But it was her night off. Fine, she said, if he needed her help, she didn’t mind coming.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a cool, cloudless night with all but the brightest stars doused by a full moon, around which there hung a ring of umbral haze. Later, Helen heard such a ring was considered by some to be an omen of disaster.</p>

  <p class="normal">They loaded the tagging gear into two large packs and, leaving Buzz in the house, set off in their waders along the strip of sand that traced the lip of the estuary. The sand glowed pale as bone dust and although they walked apart, the angle of the moon made their shadows merge.</p>

  <p class="normal">They could see from a long way off that the crabs had come. Along the shore’s edge the water seethed and as they drew nearer they saw hundreds of domed and barnacled shells jostling in the shallows. The water swirled around them in galaxies of phosphorescent foam.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the previous year Helen knew what to do. With barely a word, they took what they needed from their packs and got to work. Joel waded in among the crabs, putting on a pair of tough rubber gauntlets. One by one, he carefully hoisted the crabs and held them to the beam of the flashlight that hung on a cord around his neck. The crabs bucked and struggled in his hands, the hinged rear part of their shells thrashing as they tried to stab him with their dagger-tails. When he found one that was tagged, he called out the number and Helen, beside him, noted it down on a pad. With those that weren’t tagged, he called out their sex and size and she duly recorded them and handed him tags to clip to their shells.</p>

  <p class="normal">Occasionally, as they worked Joel would point something out and explain what was going on. How the males, sometimes as many as a dozen of them, were fighting to latch onto a single female, but how only one would succeed. He pointed the flashlight at a female for Helen to see. The crab had dug herself a shallow nest in the sand, as near to the water’s edge as she dared. You could see the eggs streaming from her, thousands of them in shiny gray-green clusters and the male, hooked to her, spreading his sperm on them, while the other males fought to do the same, oblivious to the humans who stood among them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen started to ask him something but suddenly heard her voice crack and she stopped in mid-sentence and realized that her eyes were running with tears. Last year she had watched this same scene in wonder. But the frenzy, the blind, primal ferocity of this ancient creature’s will to survive, to propel its genes across the centuries, for millions and millions of years, the immense, implacable power of it, now struck her with a fearful sadness.</p>

  <p class="normal">Joel saw her face contort and splashed toward her and took her in his arms. And she clung to him and sobbed into his chest like a desolate child.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What?’ he said, stroking a tangle of hair from her face. ‘What is it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s only a year, Helen. It’ll go so fast. I’ll come back and this time next year we can be here again. Tagging crabs together.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t joke.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m not. I mean it. I promise.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She looked up at him and thought she saw a hint of tears in his eyes too.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I love you,’ she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I love you too.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She would never forget how he looked at that moment. Like a frail ghost and suddenly somehow a total stranger. Then he smiled and the image was gone. And he kissed her, while the horseshoes churned and clattered heedlessly around them, their black backs glistening at the moon.</p>

  <div class="normal1">
    He had been gone, now, for nearly two months.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">Helen finished her cigarette and called Buzz. He had been in the ark nosing for rats long enough and she was getting cold. She called him and started to walk back along the shore. Above her, high in the woods, an owl was uttering the same plaintive message over and over again.</p>

  <p class="normal">She picked up her bag outside the back door. The bug party around the outside light was still going strong. Buzz barked at them a couple of times and she told him to hush and nudged him through the screen door into the kitchen.</p>

  <p class="normal">She didn’t turn on the lights. There was too much of Joel everywhere you looked. In a vain attempt to convince her he was coming back, he had left a lot of his belongings. Books, a pair of boots, the Discman with its state of the art speakers, all his opera CDs. Since he had gone, she hadn’t trusted herself to listen to music of any kind.</p>

  <p class="normal">The red light on the answering machine showed there were three messages. She listened to them in the dark, looking out at the path of moonlight on the bay. One was from her father, hoping she’d gotten home safely and saying he was sure that she and Courtney were going to be friends. The second was from Celia, just to say hi. And the third was from her old wolf-buddy Dan Prior.</p>

  <p class="normal">They’d had the briefest of flings one summer when they were tracking together in northern Minnesota. He’d been one of the rare exceptions to the catalog of jerks she normally dated, but it had still been a mistake. They were cut out to be friends, not lovers. And like all the best men, Dan was happily married. Worse still, Helen knew - and liked - his wife and daughter.</p>

  <p class="normal">They hadn’t talked in about three years and it was good to hear his voice on the machine. He said he had a job for her, in Montana. Would she please give him a call.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen looked at her watch. It was a quarter to one. And she remembered that it was her birthday.</p>
