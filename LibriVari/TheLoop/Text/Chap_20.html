  <h2>19</h2>

  <div class="normal1">
    <b>D</b>an Prior was not a religious man. At his most indulgent, he considered faith an obstacle to understanding, an excuse for not sorting out the here and the now. More practically, if something needed fixing, it just seemed smarter to try and fix it yourself than leave it to someone you’d never met and who might not show up in any case.
  </div>

  <p class="normal">There were two exceptional occasions however when Dan resorted to prayer. The first was any Saturday night when his daughter was out later than they had agreed and hadn’t phoned (which happened so routinely nowadays, God would soon have him down as a new recruit). The second was whenever he went flying. It seemed only logical. At several thousand feet, room for self-help was limited and if there did happen to be Someone up there, you were at least well placed for a hearing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Today, however, as he tried to hold the Cessna steady in the bruising north wind, Dan didn’t pray for his and Helen’s safety. Looking down at the higher reaches of the Hope Valley, he could see that word of Abe Harding’s alleged losses to the wolves had indeed spread. All along the mountain front, herds were being gathered from their summer allotments. So instead, in a worrying and psalmic extension of normal practice, Dan asked the Lord that all the ranchers he saw down there, on their horses tiny as ticks, would find their cattle had safely grazed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He watched the plane’s shadow pass over the last of them, then looked ahead again to where the mountains curved away north like a fossilized spine, its vertebrae sprinkled with a first fall of snow. The wind had scoured all residue of summer haze from the sky. It was that kind of limpid, limitless blue that made you feel you could fly to the moon and back if you only had the fuel.</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan kept his poetry to himself, knowing that in her present state, it would be lost on Helen. She was hunched in the seat beside him, scanning the radio frequencies and hiding her hangover with sunglasses and a faded Minnesota Timberwolves cap. Her face was a grayer shade of green every time he glanced at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She had arrived at the airfield in Helena with a large black coffee that she’d stopped for on the way and warned him at once that she was in no mood for jokes. She was in such a fragile state that when they’d picked up the first signal, a couple of miles south-west of Hope, she winced and reached for the volume control.</p>

  <p class="normal">The signal belonged to the young male and, scanning on, Helen had soon found the mother’s. Both were strongest as the plane crossed Wrong Creek, which was good news, because it meant they were away from the cattle. They seemed to be on the north side of the canyon, probably resting up somewhere, about a mile farther up from where Helen had trapped the male. But in the three passes they had so far made, they hadn’t been able to spot them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Apart from a few small meadows, the canyon was thick with trees and though the wind was stripping the aspens of their bright yellow leaves, the green of the pine and fir was impenetrable. Even away from the trees, there were a thousand rocky nooks where a wolf might lie hidden.</p>

  <p class="normal">They reached the end of the canyon again and Dan climbed toward the sun and banked into another turn. At once the wind caught them and the plane lurched and bumped like a car in a pothole, making Dan grateful he hadn’t had breakfast.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘God almighty, Prior!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sorry.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I see your flying hasn’t improved.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I see your hangover hasn’t.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He went lower this time, flying above the southern rim of the canyon and tilting the plane so Helen could get a better view. The signals from the starboard antenna grew stronger and stronger and suddenly Helen called out and pointed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There she is.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The alpha?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Unless there’s another pale one. And there are the others - four, no, five others.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan leaned across but couldn’t make them out. ‘Where?’ ‘See that shelf of rock above the aspens?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen had the binoculars on them now. ‘No, that’s her, she’s got a collar. And there’s the young male we collared. Hey, isn’t that great?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You say the Calder boy thinks there are nine in all?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Four adults, five pups.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Any sign of the alpha male down there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. They’re all too gray and too small. Looks like four pups and the two we collared.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen got out her camera and Dan circled again so she could take some pictures on a long lens. The wolves were lounging in the sun and seemed none too bothered about the plane until the third pass when the mother roused them and led them off into the trees.</p>

  <p class="normal">They flew the canyon and the surrounding area for awhile longer, hoping to see the other three, but there was no sign of them. On the way back to the airfield, Helen made notes of what they had seen, logging the time and the map reference. She was looking a little less green.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Feeling better?’ Dan asked, when she’d finished.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. Sorry for being such a grouch.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan just smiled. Neither of them spoke for the rest of the trip. He wondered if something other than the hangover was bothering her. She seemed a little sad and distracted.</p>

  <p class="normal">They landed and drove in their two cars back to the office. It was the first time Helen had been there since the day she arrived and Donna greeted her like a long-lost friend, congratulating her on catching the wolves. Dan suggested to Helen that they take the film she’d shot to the one-hour photo store and get something to eat while it was being processed.</p>

  <p class="normal">They walked down the hill to the photo store then on a few blocks to a little coffee shop that did good turkey sandwiches and milkshakes. While they ate they talked about what they’d seen in the canyon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’d feel a whole lot happier if the alpha male had been up there with them,’ Dan said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe he was and we just couldn’t see him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Maybe. My guess is he likes to be lower down, near all those tasty young steers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Dan. You don’t believe Abe Harding’s calves were killed by wolves, do you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who can say?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We’re not talking about the world’s greatest rancher here. I bet he loses that many every summer. Probably doesn’t even know how many he had up there in the first place.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, if these wolves <i>are</i> killing cattle, you know we’re going to have to take them out.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t look so surprised. Helen, we’re working to a set of rules here, not making it up as we go along. Wolves who kill livestock jeopardize the whole recovery program.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you mean <i>take than out</i>? Relocate them?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In the old days maybe, not now. There’s nowhere to put them. No, I mean lethal control.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Shoot them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen shook her head and looked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Helen, wake up. It’s the real world. Read the Control Plan.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They finished their sandwiches in silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">They collected the photos and looked through them as they walked back up the hill to the office. There were some good ones. Helen said she wouldn’t come inside. She’d left Buzz in the cabin and needed to check the traplines. In a vain attempt to lighten things up, Dan said maybe she would find she’d caught the other three, the ones they hadn’t seen from the plane. She didn’t even smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">He walked her to her pickup. He’d been looking forward to seeing her again but it had all gone wrong. He felt bad about what he’d said just now. He’d been harsh with her and it was probably because he felt rejected by her. Foolishly, with her coming to Montana, he’d hoped something might happen between them. It wasn’t going to and he’d better get used to the idea.</p>

  <p class="normal">Helen climbed into the pickup and he stood by the open door while she started the engine.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This thing going okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It sucks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll try to find you something better.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’ll do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And you? Are you okay?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Me? Oh, I’m fine.’ She saw he wasn’t convinced and softened a little and smiled. ‘Really. I’m okay. Thanks for asking.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No problem.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He noticed something beyond her on the passenger seat. ‘What’s that?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My ex-mailbox. I have to go get a new one.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She told him what had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s not good, Helen. Any idea who did it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">She shrugged. ‘Nope.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Dan frowned at it for a moment, in silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Listen, you take care up there, okay? Promise you’ll call me if something like that happens again. Anytime.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dan, it was probably just an accident. Some drunken ranch hand on his way home or something.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Promise you’ll call.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I promise. Dad.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Angels on your mailbox.’</p>

  <p class="normal">She smiled. At least he’d gotten her to smile.</p>

  <p class="normal">She swung the door shut and blew him a little kiss as she drove off. He stood there watching until the old pickup pulled into the traffic and disappeared down the hill. Then he turned and went up to the office.</p>

  <p class="normal">He could tell from Donna’s face, as soon as he walked in, that something had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve had the press on the phone,’ she said. ‘And that TV reporter. She said some ranchers out in Hope are spitting blood. Say they’ve lost a whole load of calves to the wolves.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How many?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So far, forty-three.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What! Did they say which ranchers?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yeah. And one of them’s Buck Calder.’</p>
