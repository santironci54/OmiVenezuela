  <p class="normal">‘They are wild bushmen. Sally. If you threaten or molest a wild thing it will attack you. I’ve got to get an opportunity to talk to them.’ I looked around for something to use as a shield, something strong enough to turn a reed arrow with a poisoned tip. Poison that would inflict a lingering but certain death of the most unspeakable agony.</p>

  <p class="normal">I selected the leather theodolite case, and tore it open along the seams with my hands, flattening it out to give it maximum area.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Follow me down the passage, Sal. Keep close.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Her hand was on my shoulder as I led her slowly along the rock passage, using the four-cell torch to search every dark corner and recess before moving on. The light alarmed the bats and they fluttered and squeaked about our heads. The grip of Sally’s hand on my shoulder became painfully tight, but we reached the tree-trunk that guarded the entrance to the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">We crouched by the narrow slit between rock and tree-trunk, and the bright sunlight beyond was painful to my eyes. Minutely I examined each tree-trunk in the grove, each tuft of grass, each hollow or irregularity of earth - and there was nothing. But they were there, I knew, hidden, waiting with the patience and concentration of the earth’s most skilful hunters.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were prey, there was no escaping this fact. The accepted laws of behaviour did not apply out here on the fringe of the Kalahari, I remembered the fate of the crew of a South African Air Force Dakota that force-landed in the desert ten years before. They hunted down the family of bushmen that did it and I flew to Gaberones to interpret at the trial. In the dock they wore the parachute silk as clothing, and their faces were childlike, trusting, without guilt or guile as they answered my questions.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. We killed them,’ they said. Locked in a modern gaol, like caged wild birds, they were dead within twelve months -all of them. The memory was chilling now and I thrust it aside.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now listen to me carefully, Sally. You must stay here. No matter what happens. I will go out to them. Talk to them. If ,’ I choked on the words, and cleared my throat, ‘if they hit me with an arrow I’ll have half an hour or so before—’ I rephrased the sentence, ‘—I’ll have plenty of time to get the Land-Rover and come back for you. You can drive. You’ll have no trouble following the tracks we made back to the Makarikari Pan.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben - don’t go. Oh God, Ben - please.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They’ll wait, Sal - until dark. I have to go now, in the daylight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wait here. Whatever happens, wait here.’ I shrugged off her hands and stepped to the opening.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Peace,’ I called to them in their own tongue. ‘There is no fight between us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I took a step out into the sunlight.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am a friend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Another slow step, down over the twisted roots of the wild fig, holding the flattened leather case low against my hip.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Friend!’ I called again. ‘I am of your people. I am of your clan.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I went slowly down into the silent hostile grove. There was no response to my words, no sound nor movement. Ahead of me lay a fallen tree. I began sliding towards it, my guts a hard ball of tension and fear.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I carry no weapon,’ I called, and the grove was quiet and sinister in the hush of the afternoon.</p>

  <p class="normal">I had almost reached the fallen tree, when I heard the twang of the bow and I dived for the shelter of the dead trunk. Close beside my head the arrow fluted, humming in the silence, and I went down. My face was pressed into the dry earth, my heart frozen with fear at the close passage of such hideous death.</p>

  <p class="normal">I heard footsteps, running, from behind me and I rolled over on my side to defend myself.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally was running down the wild fig roots towards me, ignoring my instructions, her face a pale mask of deathly terror, her mouth open in a silent scream. She had seen me fall and lie still, and the thought of me dead had triggered her panic. Now as I moved she realized her mistake, and she faltered in her run, suddenly aware of her own vulnerability.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get back, Sal,’ I yelled. ‘Get back!’ Her uncertainty turned to dismay and she stopped, stranded halfway between the cavern entrance and my dead tree-trunk, undecided on which way to move.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the edge of my vision I saw the little yellow bushman rise from a patch of pale grass. There was an arrow notched to his bow and the feathered flights were drawn back to his cheek as he aimed. He was fifty paces from where Sally hovered, and he held his aim for a second.</p>

  <p class="normal">I dived across the space that separated Sally from me at the instant the bushman released the arrow. The arrow and I flew on an interception course, two sides of a triangle with Sally at the apex.</p>

  <p class="normal">I saw the humming blur of the arrow flash in belly-high at Sally and I knew I could not reach her before it struck. I threw the flattened leather case with a despairing underhand flick of my wrist as I dived towards her. It cart-wheeled lazily, spinning in the air - and the arrow slapped into it. The deadly iron tip, with the poison-smeared barbs, bit into the tough leather of the case. Arrow and case fell harmlessly at Sally’s feet, and I picked her up in my arms and spinning on my heels, doubled up under her weight. I raced back towards the cover of the dead tree-trunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bushman was still on his knees in the grass ahead of me He reached over his shoulder and pulled another arrow from his quiver, in one smoothly practised movement he had notched and drawn.</p>

  <p class="normal">This time there was no hope of dodging, and I ran on grimly. The bow-string sang, the arrow flew, and instantly I felt a violent jerk at my neck. I knew I was hit, and with Sally still in my arms we fell behind the dead tree-trunk.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think I’m hit, Sal.’ I could feel the arrow dangling against my chest as I rolled away from her. ‘Break off the shaft - don’t try and pull it out against the barbs.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We lay facing each other, our eyes only a few inches apart Strangely, now that I was a dead man I felt no fear,,The thing was done, even if I was hit a dozen more times, my fate would be unaltered. It remained only to get Sally safely away before the poison did its work.</p>

  <p class="normal">She reached out with shaking hands and took the frail reed arrow, lifting it gingerly - and then her face cleared.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Your collar, Ben, it’s lodged in the collar of your jacket. It hasn’t touched you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Relief washed through me as I ran my hands up the shaft of the arrow, and found that I was not dead. Carefully lying on my side while Sally held the tip of the arrow away from my flesh, I shrugged off my light khaki jacket. For a moment I stared in revulsion at the hand-forged iron arrow-head with the sticky toffee-coloured material clogging the wicked barbs, then I threw jacket and arrow aside.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘God, that was close,’ I whispered. ‘Listen, Sal, I think there is only one of them here. He’s a young man, panicky, probably as afraid as we are. I will try to talk to him again.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I wriggled forward against the reassuring solidity of the dead tree, and raised my voice in the most persuasive tones that would pass my parched throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am your friend. Though you fly your arrows at me, I will not war with you. I have lived with your people, I am one with you. How else do I speak your language?’</p>

  <p class="normal">A deathly, impenetrable silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How else do I speak the tongue of the people?’ I asked again, and strained my ears for a sound.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the bushman spoke, his voice a high-pitched fluting, broken up with soft ducking and clicking sounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The devils of the forest speak in many tongues. I close my ears to your deceits.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am no devil. I have lived as one of yours. Did you never hear of the one named the Sunbird,’ I used my bushman name, ‘who stayed with the people of Xhai and became their brother?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Another long silence followed, but now I sensed that the little bushman was undecided, puzzled, no longer afraid and deadly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you know of the old man named Xhai?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know of him,’ admitted the bushman, and I breathed a little easier.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you hear of the one they called the Sunbird?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Another long pause, then reluctantly, ‘I have heard men speak of it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am that one.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the silence went on for ten minutes or more. I knew the bushman was considering my <span lang="en-US">claim</span> from every possible angle. At last he spoke again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Xhai and I hunt together this season. Even now he comes, before darkness he will be here. We will wait for him.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will wait for him,’ I agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But if you move I will kill you,’ warned the bushman, and I took him at his word.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Xhai the old bushman came to my shoulder, and heaven knows I am no giant. He had the characteristically flattened features, with high cheekbones and oriental eyes, but his skin was dry and wrinkled, like an old yellow raisin. The wrinkling extended over his entire body as though he were covered with brittle parchment. The little peppercorns of hair on his scalp were smoky-grey with age, but his teeth were startling white and perfect, and his eyes were black and sparkling. I had often thought that they were pixie eyes, alive with mischief and intelligent curiosity.</p>

  <p class="normal">When I told him how his friend had tried to kill us, he thought it an excellent joke and went off into little grunting explosions of laughter, at the same time shyly covering his mouth with one hand. The younger bushman’s name was Ghal, and he was married to one of Xhai’s daughters, so Xhai felt free to josh him mercilessly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sunbird is a white ghost!’ he wheezed. ‘Shoot him, Ghal, quickly! Before he flies away.’ Overwhelmed by his own humour, Xhai staggered in mirth-racked circles giving an imitation of how he thought a ghost would look as it flew away. Ghal was very embarrassed and looked down at his feet as he shuffled them in the dust. I chuckled weakly, the sound of flighted arrows very fresh in my memory.</p>

  <p class="normal">Xhai stopped laughing abruptly, and demanded anxiously, ‘Sunbird. have you got tobacco?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh. my God!’ 1 said in English.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Sally was alarmed by my tone, expecting that something else horrifying had happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tobacco,’ I said. ‘We haven’t any,’ Neither Sally nor I used the stuff, but it is very precious to a bushman.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren left a box of cigars in the Land-Rover.’ Sally reminded me ‘Is that any use?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Both Ghal and Xhai were intrigued with the aluminium cylinders in which the Romeo and Juliette cigars were packed. After I showed them how to open them and remove the tobacco, they cooed and chattered with delight. Then Xhai sniffed the cigar like the true connoisseur he was, nodded approvingly and took a big bite. He chewed a while and then tucked the wad of sodden cigar up under his top lip. He passed the stub to Ghal who bit into it and followed Xhai’s example. The two of them squatted on their haunches, positively glowing with contentment and my heart went out to them. It took so little to make them happy.</p>

  <p class="normal">They stayed with us that night, cooking on our fire a meal of bush-rats threaded on a stick like kebabs, and grilled over the open coals without gutting or removal of the skin. The hair frizzled off in the fire and stank like burning rags.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think I’m going to throw up,’ murmured Sally palely as she watched the relish with which our two friends ate, but she didn’t.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why do they call you Sunbird?’ she asked later, and I repeated her question to. Xhai.</p>

  <p class="normal">He jumped up and did his celebrated imitation of a sun-bird, darting his head and fluttering his hands. It was convincingly done, for bushmen are wonderful observers of nature.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They say that’s how I act when I get excited,’ I explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes!’ Sally <span lang="en-US">exclaimed</span>, clapping her hands with delight as she recognized me, and then they were all laughing.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning we went to the cave together, all four of us, and in that setting the little men were completely at home. I photographed them, and Sally sketched them as they sat on the rocks by the pool. She was fascinated by their delicate little hands and feet, and their enlarged buttocks, a recognized anatomical peculiarity named steatopygia, which enabled them to store food like a camel stores water, against the contingencies of the wilderness. Ghal remarked to Xhai on the activity in which Sally and I had been engaged beside the pool when he discovered us the previous day, and this led to much earthy comment and laughter. Sally wanted to know the source of it, and when I told her she blushed like a sunset, which was a pleasant change, for I am usually the blusher.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bushmen were enthusiastic over Sally’s sketches, and this enabled me to lead them naturally to the rock paintings.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They are the paintings of our people,’ Xhai boasted. ‘This has been our place from the beginning.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I pointed out the portrait of the white king and Xhai explained frankly, without any of the reserve or secrecy I had expected.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He is the king of the white ghosts.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where did he live?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He lives with his army of ghosts on the moon,’ Xhai explained - and my critics accuse <em>me</em> of being a romantic!</p>

  <p class="normal">We discussed this at some length, and I learned how the ghosts fly between moon and earth, how they are well disposed towards the bushmen, but care should be taken as the common forest devils will sometimes masquerade as white ghosts. Ghal had mistaken me for one of these.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have the white ghosts ever been men?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, certainly not.’ Xhai was a little put out by the question. ‘They were always ghosts, and they have always lived on the moon and these hills.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you ever seen them, Xhai?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My grandfather saw the ghost king.’ Xhai avoided the question with dignity.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And this, Xhai,’ I pointed out the drawings of the stone wall with its chevrons and towers, ‘what is this?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That is the Moon City,’ Xhai answered readily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where is it - on the moon?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No. It is here.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here?’ I demanded, my blood starting to race. ‘You mean on these hills?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’ Xhai nodded, and took another bite of his five-dollar cigar.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where, Xhai? Where? Can you show it to me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’ Xhai shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why not, Xhai? I am your brother. I am of your clan,’ I pleaded. ‘Your secrets are my secrets.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are my brother,’ Xhai agreed, ‘but I cannot show you the City of the Moon. It is a ghost city. Only when the moon is full and the white ghosts come down, then the city stands upon the plain below the hills - but in the morning it is gone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">My blood no longer raced, and my excitement cooled.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you seen the Moon City, Xhai?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My grandfather saw it, once long ago.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Grandpa was a big mover,’ I remarked bitterly in English.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Sally wanted to know.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll explain later, Sal,’ I said, and turned back to the old bushman. ‘Xhai, in all your life have you ever seen such a city as this? A place of tall stone walls, of round stone towers? I don’t mean here at these hills, but anywhere. In the north, by the great river, in the desert of the west - anywhere?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ said Xhai, ‘I have never seen such a place.’ And I knew that there was no lost city north of the great Pan or south of the Zambezi, for if there were, Xhai would have come across it in seventy years of ceaseless wandering.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It was probably some old bushman who wandered 270 miles east of here and saw the temple at Zimbabwe,’ I suggested to Sally that night as we sat around the fire and discussed the old bushman’s story. ‘He was so impressed that on his return he painted it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then how do you explain your white king?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know, Sal,’ I told her honestly. ‘Perhaps it is a white lady with a bouquet of flowers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It seems that whenever I receive a serious disappointment -Sally’s rejection of my proposal, and the story of the Moon City were both serious - my brain ceases to function for a period. I missed the clue completely, and the link-up was so obvious. I mean, for God’s sake, I have a tested IQ of 156 - I’m a goddamned genius!</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning the two bushmen went back to the families they had left by the Pan. They took with them the treasures we lavished upon them. A hatchet, Sally’s make-up mirror, two knives and half a box of Romeo and Juliette cigars. They trotted away into the vastness of the Kalahari, without a backward glance, and <span lang="en-US">left</span> us the poorer for their going.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The helicopter came the following week, bringing in a full load of supplies and the special equipment I had asked Louren to send us.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally and I carried the rubber dinghy up to the cavern and inflated it beside the pool, taking it in turns to blow until we felt dizzy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally launched it and paddled happily around the pool while I assembled the rest of the equipment. There was a short glass-fibre fishing-rod, a heavy one, twenty-five ounces, and in the case which held a 12/0 Penn Senator fishing-reel was a note from Louren: ‘What are you after, for crying out loud? Sand fish, or desert trout? “L”’</p>

  <p class="normal">I fitted the reel to rod, threaded the line through the runners, and attached the five-pound lead weight to the end of it. Sally paddled us out into the centre of the pool. I dropped the lead weight over the side, disengaged the clutch on the reel, and let the line start running out.</p>

  <p class="normal">As I had requested, the plaited Dacron line was marked at intervals of fifty feet, and as each marker of coloured cotton disappeared into the luminous green water, we counted aloud.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Five, six, seven - my God, Ben. It’s bottomless.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘These limestone sink-holes can go down to tremendous depths.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Eleven, twelve, thirteen.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I hope we’ve got enough line.’ Sally eyed what remained on the spool dubiously.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have got 800 yards here,’ I told her. ‘It will be more than enough.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sixteen, seventeen.’ Even I was impressed, I had guessed at a depth of around 400 feet, the same as the Sleeping Pool at Sinoia, but still the line unwound steadily from the big-game fishing-reel.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last I felt the weight bump on the bottom, and the line went slack. We looked at each other with awe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A little over 850 feet,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It makes me feel scary, hanging over a hole in the earth that deep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well,’ I said with finality, ‘I had plans to explore the bottom with a Scuba, but that’s out now. Whatever is down there will stay there for ever. Nobody can dive that deep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally looked down into the green depths, and the dappled, moving, reflected light illuminated her face weirdly. There were shadows in her eyes, and her expression was dazed. Suddenly she shook herself violently, a shudder that went through her whole body, and she tore her eyes away from the green surface.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh! I felt funny then. A really creepy sensation, as though something walked over my grave.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I began to wind in the fishing-line, and Sally lay back flat on the floor of the dinghy staring up at the rock roof high above. It was a laborious task to recover all that line, but I worked away steadily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben.’ Sally spoke suddenly. ‘Look up there.’ I stopped winding and looked up. We had never looked up at the opening in the roof from this angle. The shape of the opening was different.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There, Ben. On the side,’ Sally pointed. ‘That piece of rock sticking out. It’s square, too regular to be natural, surely?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I studied it for a while.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps.’ I was dubious.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know we have never tried to find where the cavern opens out onto the top of the hills, Ben.’ Sally sat up excitedly. ‘Can’t we do that. Let’s go up and look at that piece of square stone. Can we, Ben?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Of course.’ I agreed readily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Today. Now! Can we go now?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hell, Sal. It’s after two o’clock already. We will be out after dark.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, come on! We can take torches with us.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The growth of vegetation at the crest of the hills was dense and spiny. I was glad of the machete I had with me, and I hacked a path for us through it. We had marked the approximate position of the hole from the plain below, but even then we blundered about in the undergrowth for two hours before I nearly walked into it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly the earth opened at my feet in that frightening black shaft, and I threw myself backwards, nearly knocking Sally down.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That was a near one.’ I was shaken, and I kept a respectful distance from the edge as we worked our way around to where a slab of stone jutted squarely out into the void.</p>

  <p class="normal">I knelt on the lip to examine the stone. Far below, the surface of the emerald pool glowed in the gloomy depths. I do not like exposed heights, and I felt distinctly queasy as I leaned out to touch the flat surface of the stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is certainly regular. Sal.’ I ran my hands over it. ‘But I can’t feel any chisel marks. It’s been badly weathered though, perhaps—’</p>

  <p class="normal">I looked up and froze with horror. Sally had walked out onto the stone platform as though it were a diving-board. She stood now with her toes over the edge, and as I watched in horror she lifted her hands above her head. She pointed them straight at the sky with all her fingers and both thumbs extended stiffly in that same gesture she had used when first she saw the emerald pool.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sally!’ I screamed, and her head jerked. She swayed slightly. I scrambled to my knees.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t. Sally, don’t!’ I screamed again, for I knew she was about to plunge into the hungry stone mouth. Slowly she leaned out over the gap. I ran out onto the stone platform and as she went forward beyond the point of balance my hand closed on her upper arm. For brief unholy seconds we teetered and struggled together on the lip of stone, then I dragged her back, and pulled her to safety.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly she was shaking and weeping hysterically, and I clung to her, for I also was badly scared. Something had happened that was beyond my understanding, something mystical and deeply disturbing.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Sally’s sobs had abated, I asked her gently, ‘What happened, Sal? Why did you do it?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I don’t know. I just felt dizzy, and there was a black roaring in my head, and - oh, I don’t know, Ben. I just don’t know.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was another twenty minutes before Sally seemed sufficiently recovered to begin the journey back to camp, and by then the sun was setting. Before we reached the path down the cliff face it was completely dark.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The moon will be up in a few minutes. Sal. I don’t fancy going down the cliff in the dark. Let’s wait for it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We sat on the edge of the cliff huddled together, not for warmth, for the air was still hot and the rocks were sunbaked, but because both of us were still a little shaken from the experience we had just come through. The moon was a big silver glow beneath the horizon, then it pushed up fat and yellow and round above the trees, and washed the land with a soft pale light.</p>

  <p class="normal">I looked at Sally. Her face was silver-grey in the moonlight with dark bruised eyes, and her expression was remote and infinitely sad.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Shall we go, Sal?’ I hugged her lightly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In a minute. It’s so beautiful.’ I turned to stare out over the moon-silver plain. Africa has many moods, many faces, and I love them all. Here, before us. she put on one of her more enchanting displays. We were silent and engrossed for a long time.</p>

  <p class="normal">Suddenly I felt Sally stir, against me, half rising.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ready?’ I asked her, rising with her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben!’ Her hand closed on my wrist with surprising strength, she was shaking my arm.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben! Ben!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it, Sal?’ I was seized with dread that her earlier mood had returned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look, Ben. Look!’ Her voice was choked with emotion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it, Sal? Are you all right?’</p>

  <p class="normal">With one hand she was shaking my arm, with the other she was pointing down at the plain below us.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Look, Ben, there it is!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sally!’ I put both arms around her to restrain her. ‘Easy, my dear. Just sit down quietly.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t be a fool, Ben. I’m perfectly all right. Just look down there.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Still holding her securely. I did as she asked. I stared and saw nothing.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you see it, Ben?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No.’ And then, like the face in the picture-puzzle, it was there. It was there, as it should have been from the beginning.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can you see it?’ Sally was trembling. ‘Tell me you can see it too, Ben. Tell me I’m not imagining it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ I mumbled, still not certain, ‘yes, I think—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s the City of the Moon, Ben. The ghost city of the bush-men - it’s our lost city, Ben. It is. It is - it must be!’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was vague, hazy. I shut my eyes tightly and opened them again. It was still there.</p>

  <p class="normal">The double enclosure around the silent grove, vast symmetrical tracings on the silver plain, dark shadowy lines. There were the dark circles that marked the spots on which the phallic towers had stood, some of them obscured by the trees of the grove. Beyond the walls were the honeycomb cells of the lower city, crescent-shaped and spread around the shores of the ancient, vanished lake.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The moon,’ I whispered. ‘Low angle. Picking up the outline of the foundations. They must be so flattened that we have walked over them, lived on top of them for a month! The light of the full moon is just the right strength to cast shadows where the remains stand slightly proud.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The photograph!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. From 36,000 feet, the light low enough and soft enough to give the same effect,’ I agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We probably wouldn’t have seen it from such a low altitude, the helicopter didn’t go high enough,’ Sally suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And it was noon,’ I agreed. ‘High-angle sun, no shadows. That is why Louren didn’t see it from the helicopter.’ It was so simple, and I had missed it. Some bloody genius - they must have botched the tests.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘But there are no walls, Ben, no towers, nothing. Only the foundations. What happened to it? What happened to our city?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We will find out, Sal,’ I promised. ‘But now let’s mark it, before it disappears again.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I handed her the one torch from the knapsack, ‘One flash means “come towards me”; two flashes, “move away from me”; three, “move left”; four, “move right”; and a windmill means “you’re on it”.’ Quickly we agreed a simple code. ‘I’ll go down onto the plain and you signal me. Put me on top of the large tower first, then guide me around the perimeter of the outer walls. We had better work fast, we don’t know how long the effect will last. Give me a flat cut-out sign when it goes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It lasted a little over an hour with me scampering about on the plain in obedience to Sally’s signals, and then the city faded, and slowly vanished as the moon rose towards its zenith. I went up to fetch Sally down from the cliff. I was bare to the waist, having ripped my shirt to shreds and tied strips of it onto clumps of grass and shrubs as markers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Back in camp we built a huge fire and I got out the Glen Grant to celebrate. We were so elated, and there was so much to discuss and marvel over, that sleep was long delayed.</p>

  <p class="normal">We went over the lighting phenomenon again in greater detail, agreeing how it worked and ruefully remembering how close we had come to the truth when we discussed the low sun effect on our very first day, the day we discovered the fresh-water mussel shells. We discussed the shells and their new significance.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I swear here and now, with all the gods as my witness, that I will never again toss a piece of vital scientific evidence over my shoulder.’ I made oath and testament.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s drink to that,’ suggested Sal.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What a wonderful idea,’ I agreed, and refilled the glasses. Then we went on to the old bushman’s story.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It just goes to show you that every piece of legend, every piece of folklore is based on some fact, however garbled.’ Sally becomes all philosophical after one shot of Glen Grant.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And let’s face facts, my blood brother Xhai is a champion garbler of facts from way back - the City of the Moon, forsooth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s a lovely name. Let’s keep it,’ Sally suggested. ‘And what do you think about Xhai’s grandfather actually meeting one of the white ghosts?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He probably saw one of the old hunters or prospectors, remember, we nearly had ghost status awarded us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Literally and figuratively,’ Sally reminded me.</p>

  <p class="normal">The talk went on and on while the moon made its splendid transit of the sky above us. Every now and then serious discussion degenerated into effusive outbursts of, ‘Oh, Ben. Isn’t it wonderful. We’ve got a whole Phoenician city to excavate. All to ourselves.’ Or, ‘My God, Sal. All my life I’ve dreamed of something like this happening to me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was long past midnight before we got our feet back on the earth, and Sally brought up the subject of practical procedure.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do we do, Ben? Do we tell Louren Sturvesant now?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I poured another drink slowly, while I considered this.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t you think, Sal, we should sink a pothole, a small one, of course, on the foundations. Just to be certain we’re not making fools of ourselves?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, you know that’s the first rule. Don’t go scratching around haphazardly. You might destroy something valuable. We should wait until we can go in on an orderly, organized basis.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know, Sal. But I just can’t help myself. Just one tiny little hole?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay,’ she grinned. ‘Just one tiny little hole.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I suppose we’d better try and get some sleep now, it’s past two o’clock.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Just before we finally drifted off, Sally murmured against my chest, ‘I still wonder what happened to our city. If the bushman picture was correct then huge walls and towers of masonry have vanished into thin air.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. It’s going to be exciting to find out.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">With that strength of character which I am able occasionally to conjure up, I firmly thrust aside the temptation to open a trench within the temple enclosure, and instead I chose a spot upon the foundations of the outer wall where I hoped I would do minimum damage.</p>

  <p class="normal">With Sally watching avidly, and volunteering more than her share of advice, I marked out with tapes torn from my sheets the outline of the intended excavation. A narrow trench three foot wide and twenty foot long, set at a right-angle to the run of the foundations so as to open a cross-section of the horizon.</p>

  <p class="normal">We numbered the tapes at intervals of one foot, and Sally cross-referenced her notebook to the markings on the tapes. I fetched the cameras, tools and tarpaulin from the Land-Rover. Our trench was only thirty yards from the tents. We had camped almost on top of the ancient wall.</p>

  <p class="normal">I spread the tarpaulin ready to receive the earth removed from the trench, and then I pulled off my shirt and threw it aside. I was no longer ashamed to expose my body in front of Sally. I spat on the palms of my hands, straddled the tapes, hefted the pick, and glanced at Sally, sitting attentively on the tarpaulin with a big floppy-brimmed hat on her head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay?’ I grinned at her.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, partner?’ she said, and I was startled. The words jarred, they were Louren’s and mine. We didn’t say them to other people. Then suddenly I thought, what the hell! I love her also.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All the way, girl!’ I agreed and swung the pick. It was good to fed the pick feather-light in my hands, and the head clunking deep into the sandy earth. I worked steadily, swinging pick and shovel easily, but soon the sweat was running in rivulets down my body and soaking my breeches. As I shovelled the earth from the trench and piled it on the tarpaulin, Sally began sifting it carefully. She chattered away happily as she worked, but my only reply was the grunt at each swing of pick.</p>

  <p class="normal">By noon I had opened the trench along its full length to a depth of three feet. The sandy soil gave way at a depth of eighteen inches to a dark reddish loam which still held the damp of the recent rains. We rested and I ate a mess of canned food and drank a bottle of Windhoek to replace some of my lost moisture.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You know,’ Sally looked me over thoughtfully, ‘once you get used to it, your body has a strange sort of beauty,’ she said, and I blushed until my eyes watered.</p>

  <p class="normal">I worked for another hour, and then suddenly the bite of the pick turned up black. I swung again - still black. I dropped the pick, and knelt in the trench.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it?’ Sally was there immediately.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ash!’ I said. ‘Charcoal!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘An ancient hearth,’ she guessed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Perhaps.’ I didn’t commit myself, luckily, so that later I could chide her for her presumption. ‘Let’s take some samples for dating.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I worked more carefully now, trying to expose the layer of ash without disturbing it. We sampled it and found that it varied between a quarter of an inch and two inches deep across the full horizon of the trench. Sally noted the depth from surface, and the position of each of the carbon samples we took, while I photographed the trench and tapes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then we straightened up and looked at each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Too big for a hearth,’ she said, and I nodded. ‘We shouldn’t go deeper, Ben. Not like this, crashing in with pick and shovel.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know,’ I said. ‘We will stop on half the trench, leave the layer of ash undisturbed - I’ll make that concession to the rules - but I am sure as hell going down on the rest of it, to bedrock, if I can!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m glad you said that,’ Sally applauded my decision. ‘It’s exactly what I feel as well.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You begin at the far end. I’ll start here and we will work towards each other,’ I instructed, and we began lifting the layer of ash from half the trench. I found that immediately below it was a floor of hard clay and, though I didn’t say so, I guessed it was a building filler. A transported layer, not occurring naturally.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go carefully,’ I cautioned Sally.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Quoth the pick-and-shovel man,’ she muttered sarcastically without looking up, and almost immediately she made the first discovery from the ruins of the City of the Moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">As I write I have her notebook in front of me, with her grubby, earthy fingerprints upon the pages and her big schoolgirlish handwriting filling it.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Trench 1. Reference AC. 6. II.4. Depth 4’2½“.</p>

  <p class="normal">Item. One glass bead. Oval. Blue. Circum <em>2½</em> mm,</p>

  <p class="normal">Pierced. Slightly heat-distorted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Remarks: Found in layer of ash at Level I</p>

  <p class="normal">Index No CM. 1</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">This laconic notation can give no idea of our jubilation, the way we hugged each other and laughed in the sun. It was a typical blue Phoenician trade bead, and I cupped the tiny pellet of glass in my one hand.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m going to take it and stick it up their backsides.’ I threatened, referring of course to my critics.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If that end is as narrow as their minds, Ben dear, then it will be a pretty tight fit.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I started using a small pick and fifteen minutes later I made the next discovery. A charred fragment of bone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Human?’ Sally asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Possibly.’ I said. ‘Head of a human femur - the shaft has been burned away’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Cannibalism? Cremation?’ Sally hazarded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You do run on,’ I said.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you think then?’ she challenged. I was silent for a long time, then I made up my mind, and came out with it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think at this level the City of the Moon was sacked and burned, its inhabitants were slaughtered, the walls thrown down and its buildings obliterated.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally whistled softly, staring at me in mock amazement. ‘On the evidence of one bead, and a piece of bone - that just has to be the greatest flyer of all time!’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">That evening, in reply to Larkin’s bellowed queries, I replied, ‘Thanks, Peter. We are fine. No, we don’t need anything. Yes. Good. Please tell Mr Sturvesant there is no change here, nothing to report.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I switched off the set, and avoided Sally’s eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes,’ she told me sternly. ‘After a stinking one like that, you should look guilty!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Well, you said yourself it’s only one bead and a piece of bone.’</p>

  <p class="normal">But by the evening two days later, I had no such excuse, for I had sunk my trench seven feet five inches and there I uncovered the first of four courses of dry packed masonry. The stones were skilfully dressed, and squared. The joints between each block were so tight that a knife-blade would not go between them. The stones were bigger than those of Zimbabwe, clearly intended to support the weight of a substantial edifice; the average size was approximately four feet, by two, by two. They were cut from red sandstone similar to that of the cliffs and as I examined the workmanship I knew beyond any doubt that they were the work of artisans from a powerful and wealthy civilization.</p>

  <p class="normal">That night I spoke to Larkin again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘How soon can you get a message through to Mr Sturvesant, Peter?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘He should have got back from New York today. I can put a phone call through this evening.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Please ask him to come right away.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You mean you want him to drop everything and come running - that’s a laugh.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Just do it, please.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The helicopter arrived at three o’clock the following afternoon, and I ran to meet it, pulling on my shirt.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What have you got for me, Ben?’ Louren demanded as he climbed, big and blond, out of the cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think you are going to like it,’ I told him, as we shook hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">Five hours later we sat around the fire and Louren smiled over the rim of his glass at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You were right, lad. I do like it!’ This was the first opinion he had expressed since his arrival. He had followed Sal and me from excavation to cavern to cliff-top, listening attentively to our explanations, shaking his head with a rueful grin when I explained our theory of low-angle light on the ruins, firing a question occasionally in the same tone I had heard him use in a directors’ meeting. Each time the question was relevant, incisive and searching, as though he were evaluating a business deal. When Sally spoke he stood close to her, looking frankly into her face, those marvellous classical features of his rapt and still. Once she touched his arm to enforce a point and they smiled at each other. I was happy to see them so friendly at last, for they were the two people in the world I loved.</p>

  <p class="normal">He knelt with me in the bottom of the trench and caressed the worked stone with his hands, he held the charred bone and melted glass bead in his palm and frowned at them as though trying to draw their secrets from them by sheer force of concentration.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just before sunset, at Louren’s insistence, we returned to the cavern and went to the rear wall. I lit one of the gas lanterns and placed it so that its light fell full on the painting of the white king. Then the three of us sat around it in a semicircle and studied it in every detail. The king’s head was in profile and Sally pointed out the features, the long straight nose and high forehead.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A face like that never came out of Africa,’ she said, and as a contrast she picked out the painting of another figure farther down the wall. ‘Look at that. It’s a Bantu and no mistaking it. The artist was skilled enough to differentiate between the features of each type.’</p>

  <p class="normal">However, Louren’s attention never wavered from his scrutiny of the king. Again he seemed to be trying to wrest its secrets from it, but the king was regally aloof and at last Louren sighed and stood up. He was about to turn away when his glance dropped to the white-robed priest figures below the king.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What are those?’ he asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have named them the priests,’ I told him, ‘but Sally feels they could be Arab traders or—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The figure in the centre—’ he pointed out the central priest figure, and his voice was sharp, almost alarmed, ‘what is he doing?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bowing to the king,’ Sally suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Even though he is bowing, he stands taller than the others?’ Louren protested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Size was the bushman artist’s way of showing importance. See the relative size of the king - although they are pygmies they always show themselves as giants - the size of the central priest would signify that he was the High Priest, or the leader of the Arabs, if Sally is right.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If he is bowing, it’s with the top third of his body only and he is the only one doing it. The others are erect.’ Louren was still not convinced. ‘It’s almost as though—’ his voice trailed away, and he shook his head. Then suddenly he shivered briefly, and I saw the gooseflesh appear on the smooth tanned skin of his upper arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s become cold in here,’ he said, folding his arms across his chest, I had not noticed any drop in temperature, but I stood up also.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let’s get back to camp,’ Louren said, and it was only after I had built up the fire to a cheerfully crackling, spark-flying blaze that he spoke again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are right, lad. I do like it!’ And he took a swallow of the malt whisky. ‘Now let’s start talking prices,’ he suggested.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Set it out for us. Lo,’ I agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will negotiate with the Botswana Government. I can put a little leverage on them. We’ll have to have a formal agreement drawn up, probably split any finds fifty-fifty, they’ll have to guarantee us access and exclusive rights. That sort of thing.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good. That’s certainly your bag of tricks, Lo.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Knowing you, Benjamin, you have a list of your requirements, the men you want, equipment - am I right?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I laughed and unbuttoned my top pocket. ‘As a matter of fact—’ I admitted as I handed him three foolscap sheets. He glanced over them quickly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Very Spartan, Ben,’ he congratulated me. ‘But I think we can go in a bit bigger than this. I’ll want at least a rough landing-strip here to start with, something to handle a Dakota. The hot weather is coming. You’ll die living out under canvas. We’ll need solid accommodation, also office and storage space with air-conditioning. That means a generator for lighting and to pump water down from the pool.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No one can ever accuse you of being half-arsed, Lo,’ I told him, and we all laughed. Sally refilled my glass. I was jubilant and mightily pleased with myself that evening. I had much to be proud of, ferreting out a secret so well hidden for millennia, and Louren was going to back me all the way, partner. The whisky went down my throat like water.</p>

  <p class="normal">I used to drink a lot of whisky. It was a way of forgetting certain things and making others easier to accept. Then about six years ago I found I hadn’t worked on a book for a year, that my memory and intellect were blurry and unreliable, and my hands shook in the morning. I still drink a tot or two of an evening, and occasionally I take on a full blast of the stuff. But now I drink because I am happy, not because I am sad.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Come on, Ben. Tonight we’ve got something to celebrate,’ Sally laughed and poured me another heavy portion.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Wow! Gently, Doctor,’ I protested weakly, but that night I got drunk, pleasantly, contentedly, floating drunk. With dignity I refused Louren’s offer of assistance and made my own way to the tent wherein Sally had discreetly segregated me since Louren’s arrival. I fell on top of my bed fully clothed and went to sleep. I half woke when Louren came in and climbed into his bed across the tent. I remember opening one eye and seeing the glow of the waning moon through the fly of the tent - or was it the first glow of dawn? It didn’t seem important then.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The personnel for the project was the most important consideration, and here I <em>was</em> lucky. Peter Willcox was due for his sabbatical leave from Cape Town University. I flew down to see him, and in six hours convinced him that he wouldn’t enjoy the fleshpots of Europe at all. Heather, his wife, was a little harder to sway, until I showed her the photographs of the white king. Like Sally, rock art is one of her big things.</p>

  <p class="normal">They were good people to have on a dig. We had been together on the excavation of the Slangkop caves. They were both in their thirties: he a little paunchy and balding with steel-rimmed spectacles and trousers always on the point of falling down. He had to keep tugging at the waistband. She was thin and angular, with a wide laughing mouth and a snub, heavily freckled nose They were childless, cheerful, knowledgeable and hard-working. Peter plays a very jazzy accordion and Heather has a voice that harmonizes well with mine.</p>

  <p class="normal">Peter introduced me to two of his postgraduate students whom he recommended without reservation. I was startled at my first meeting with them. Ral Davidson was a young man of twenty-one - although the fact that he was a man was not immediately obvious. However, Peter assured me that beneath all the untidy hair lurked a promising young archaeologist. His fiancee was an intense bespectacled young woman, who had graduated at the head of her year. Although she was depressingly plain and I prefer my women beautiful, Leslie Johns endeared herself to me immediately by whispering breathlessly, ‘Dr Kazin, I think your book, <em>Ancient Africa</em>, is the most exciting thing I’ve ever read.’</p>

  <p class="normal">This display of good taste secured the job for them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Peter Larkin found me forty-six African labourers from the southern territories of Botswana, who had never heard of the Hills of Blood nor of any curse upon them.</p>

  <p class="normal">My only disappointment was with Timothy Mageba. I spent five days at the Institute in Johannesburg on my way back from Cape Town, mostly trying to convince Timothy that I needed him at the Hills of Blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Machane,’ he said, ‘there is work here that no one else can do.’ I was to remember those words later. ‘Where you are going there is work that many men are capable of. You have these men and women already, specialists all of them. You do not need me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Please, Timothy. It would be for six months or so. Your work here can wait.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He shook his head vehemently, but I hurried on.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I really want you, and need you. There are things that you alone can explain. Timothy, there are over fifteen thousand square feet of paintings on the rocks. Much of it is symbol, stylized emblems which only you—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dr Kazin, you could send me copies of them. I can still give you my interpretation.’ Timothy switched to English, which with him was always a discouraging sign. ‘I hope you don’t insist that I leave the Institute now. My assistants cannot work without my direction.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We stared at each other for a few seconds. It was a deadlock. I could order him to come, but an unwilling helper is worse than none at all. There was a rebellious, independent spirit smouldering in Timothy’s dark eyes and I knew that there was some deeper reason why he refused to accompany me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is it—’ I hesitated. I was about to ask him if the ancient curse was the reason for his refusal. It was always disquieting to find superstition influencing an intelligent and well-educated man. I was reluctant to come straight out with it, for even with an African like Timothy the direct question is considered gauche and discourteous.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘There are always reasons within reasons, Doctor. Please believe me when I tell you it would be better if I did not accompany you this time.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right, Timothy,’ I agreed with resignation, and stood up. Again we locked glances, and it seemed to me that he was different. The flickering fires burned brighter, and again I felt the stirring of unease, of fear even, deep within me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I promise you, Doctor, that my work here is at a critical stage.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will be very interested to see it when you are ready, Timothy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">My four new assistants arrived on the commercial flight from Cape Town the following morning and we drove directly to the Sturvesant hangar where the Dakota transport was waiting for us.</p>

  <p class="normal">The flight in was noisy and gay. Peter had his accordion along, and I never travel without my old guitar. We hit a couple of easy ones like ‘Abdul Abulbul Emir’, and ‘Green grow the rushes, oh!’, and I discovered with delight that Ral Davidson whistled with a clarity and purity that was truly beautiful, and that Leslie had a sweet little soprano.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When we’ve finished this dig, I’m going to take you lot on tour,’ I told them, and began teaching them some of my own compositions.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was three weeks since I had left the Hills of Blood, and as we circled it I could see that changes had taken place in my absence. The landing-strip, complete with wind-sock, had been gouged out of the dusty plain. Near it stood a cluster of prefabricated buildings. One long central bungalow with the residential quarters grouped around it. A skeletal metal tower supported a 2,000-gallon galvanized iron water-tank, and beyond that was the encampment which housed the African labour force.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sally was waiting for us at the landing-strip, and we piled our luggage into the Land-Rover and went to look at our new home. I expected Louren to be there but Sally told me he had gone the previous day after a stay of a few days.</p>

  <p class="normal">Proudly Sally showed us over the camp. The central air-conditioned bungalow was divided into a small common room and lounge at the one end, in the centre was a large office and beyond that a storage warehouse. There were four residential huts, air-conditioned, but sparsely furnished. Sally had allotted one to the Willcoxes, one for Leslie and herself, one for Ral and me, and the fourth for Louren or other visitors, pilots, and overnight guests.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I could think of a few improvements in the sleeping arrangements,’ I muttered bitterly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Poor Ben.’ Sally smiled cruelly. ‘Civilization has caught up with you. By the way, I hope you remembered to bring your bathing costume, no skinny dips in the pool any more.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And perversely I regretted all that Louren had done for me.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Hills of Blood were no longer a lonely, mysterious place in the wilderness, but a bustling little community, with aircraft landing regularly, Land-Rovers kicking up the dust and even the clatter of an electric water-pump shattering the dreaming silence of the cavern and disturbing the still green waters of the emerald pool.</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly my group settled into their allotted tasks. Sally worked on at the cavern, with a single young African assistant. Each of the other four was placed in charge of a team of ten labourers and assigned an area in which to work.</p>

  <p class="normal">Peter and Heather shrewdly elected to work outside the main walls, in the ruins of the lower city. It was here that the ancients would have disposed of their rubbish, broken pottery, old weapons, discarded beads and the fascinating debris of a vanished civilization.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ral and Leslie with dreams of gold and treasure jumped at the chance of excavating within the enclosure, an area which the ancients would have kept swept and scrupulously clean, and therefore much less likely to yield finds of interest. That is the difference between experience and inexperience, between the impetuosity of youth and the cool calculations of an older head.</p>

  <p class="normal">I kept myself free, on a supervisory and advisory capacity, spending my time at those places where it could do the most good. Anxiously I watched Ral and Leslie to assure myself that their approach and technique was satisfactory, then I relaxed as Peter Willcox’s recommendation proved correct. They were clever, enthusiastic youngsters and, more important, they knew their way around an archaeological dig.</p>

  <p class="normal">The four teams shook themselves out as the dullards amongst the African labourers were sorted from the bright ones. In a shorter time than I had hoped for, the firm of Kazin and Company was breaking ground and doing good business.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was slow, painstaking and thoroughly satisfying work. Each evening, before the nightly singsong in the common room, the day’s work was discussed and any discoveries evaluated and related to their place in the general picture of the site.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first conclusive discovery we made was that the ash layer at Level I persisted throughout the site, even in the lower city. It was by no means evenly distributed, but showed up in patches of varying thickness. Carbon-dating, however, gave a fairly constant result, and we settled at a date of AD 450. This date seemed to be concurrent or to slightly pre-date the oldest bushman painting in the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">We were agreed that bushman occupation of the cavern would have followed immediately after the departure or disappearance of the ancients from the city. Scrupulously we referred to the first occupations as ‘ancients’, considering the term ‘Phoenician’ as yet unproven. A condition which it was my most dearly-held hope would soon be altered.</p>

  <p class="normal">Associated with the ash layer were haunting scraps of human remains. Ral uncovered an incisor in the ash against the base of the main tower, Peter a complete humerus together with many other unidentifiable bone fragments. These unburied human remains went a long way to ensuring a general acceptance of my theory of a violent end to the City of the Moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was reinforced by the baffling disappearance of walls and towers, which we could reasonably accept once stood on these bases of clay, with their vestigial stone foundations which occurred spasmodically along the outline of the temple enclosure.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ral hesitantly suggested an enemy so crazed with hatred, that he had set out to obliterate all trace of the ancients from the earth. We could all accept this.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fair enough. But what happened to thousands of tons of massive masonry?’ Sally spoke for all of us.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They scattered it out across the plain,’ Ral hazarded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A Herculean task, besides the plain was a lake in those days. To get rid of it they would have scattered it along the area between cliff and lake. There is no sign of it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Apologetically Peter Willcox reminded us of the account in Credo Mutwa’s book <em>Indaba My Children</em> of how an ancient city was carried by its people, block by block, out of the west, and how the city was rebuilt at Zimbabwe.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is red sandstone,’ Sally cut in brusquely. ‘Zimbabwe is granite, quarried from the rock on which it stands. Zimbabwe is 275 miles east of here. The labour involved is unthinkable. I will accept that the building skills and techniques were transported, but not the material itself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There were no more ideas forthcoming and we could turn from theories to facts. At the end of six weeks Louren Sturvesant visited us for the first time. All digging and other work was suspended as for two days we held a seminar, with myself as chairman, in which we presented Louren with all our accomplishments and conclusions to date.</p>

  <p class="normal">These were very impressive. To begin with, the list of artefacts, pottery sherds, and other relics filled 127 typewritten foolscap pages. Peter and Heather were responsible for most of these and they opened the seminar.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘So far all excavation without the enclosure has been confined to the area north of it, and lying within 1,000 feet of the outer perimeter. In the main it seems to have been a complex of small rooms and buildings built from adobe clay and roofed with poles and thatch—’</p>

  <p class="normal">Peter described the area in detail, giving the average size of the rooms and the exact position of each object discovered. Louren started thrashing around in his chair, and fiddling with his cigar. Peter is meticulous, almost old-maidish, in his approach to his work. Finally he reached his conclusions. ‘It seems, therefore, that this area was an extensive bazaar and market.’ And he led us through into the warehouse to examine the finds from this area. There were fragments of badly rusted iron, a bronze comb, the handle of a knife fashioned in the shape of a woman’s body, fourteen rosettes of bronze that we guessed had embossed a leather shield, twenty-five pounds’ weight of bronze discs, and stars and sun objects which were clearly ornaments, sixteen shaped and beaten bronze plates that we hoped might comprise part of a suit of body armour, a magnificent bronze dish twenty-four inches in diameter chased with a sun image and set around with an intricate border pattern, and another forty pounds’ weight of bronze scraps and fragments so badly battered and damaged as to be unidentifiable.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘These are all the bronze objects so far recovered,’ Peter told Louren. ‘The workmanship is crude, but not recognizably Bantu in conception and execution. It would relate more closely to what we know of Phoenician craftsmanship. Unlike the Romans and Greeks, they placed little value on the arts. Their artefacts, like their buildings, were massive and roughly executed. One other fact that emerges is the veneration of the sun. It was clearly a generally polytheistic community but one in which sun-worship predominated. In this settlement, it appears that Baal, the Phoenician male deity, was personified by the sun.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I thought Peter was verging on the mistake of special pleading but I let him continue without interruption. After discussing each item separately, Peter led us to the next row of tables that carried all the glass and pottery.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One hundred and twenty-five pounds’ weight of glass beads - the colours are predominantly blue and red. Phoenician colours, with greens and whites and yellows recovered only in Levels I and II. In other words, later than AD 50 which coincides approximately with the final phase of absorption of Phoenician civilization by the Romans in the Mediterranean area, and its gradual disappearance.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I interrupted. ‘The Romans were so thorough in their absorption of Phoenicia and all her works, that we know very little of them…’</p>

  <p class="normal">My attention wandered to Sally. She was in a sparkling mood, a complete change from the previous six weeks when she had been moody and withdrawn. She had washed her hair and it was shiny and springing with soft lights. Her skin also shone with golden hues where the sun had touched it, and she had coloured her lips and dramatized her eyes. Her beauty squeezed my heart. I forced my mind back to the row of tables.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘… A case in point is this recovery of pottery,’ Peter was saying. He indicated the huge display of fragments, portions, and a very few complete pieces. ‘On all of this, with one exception, there is not a single inscription. This is the exception.’ He picked up a sherd which was set out in a place of honour, and passed it to Louren. Although we had all gloated over it before, we crowded around Louren as he examined it. There was a symbol cut into the baked clay.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A chip from the lip of a cup, or vase. The symbol could conceivably be a Punic T.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Louren burst in impulsively, turning to me and laying a hand on my shoulder, ‘Conclusive, Ben. They must accept that, surely?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘By no means, Lo.’ I shook my head regretfully. ‘They will cry, “Imported”. The old trick of discrediting anything you can’t explain, or which doesn’t support your theories, by saying that it was brought in during the course of trade.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Looks as though you can’t win, Ben,’ Louren sympathized, and I grinned.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At least we haven’t uncovered any fourteenth-century Nanking pottery - or a chamber pot with Queen Victoria’s portrait on it!’</p>

  <p class="normal">Laughing we moved on to the next display of copper and copperware. There were bangles and brooches, green-encrusted and eaten away. Bales of copper wire and, significantly, ingots cast into the shape of a St Andrew’s Cross each weighing twelve pounds.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Those aren’t something new,’ Louren remarked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ I agreed. ‘They turn up all over central and southern Africa, And yet the shape is exactly that of the ingots taken from the tin mines of Cornwall by the Phoenicians - or the copper ingots from the ancient mines on Cyprus.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Still not conclusive?’ Louren looked at me and I shook my head, leading him on to see the iron work we had recovered. All of it was so badly rusted and damaged that the original shape was a matter of conjecture and guesswork. There were hundreds of arrow-heads, mostly associated with Levels I and II, spear-heads and sword-blades, axe-heads and knives.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Judging by the quantities of weapons, or what we take to be weapons, the ancients were a warlike people. Alternatively they were a people fearful of attack and well armed against it,’ I suggested, and there was a general murmur of agreement. From the iron section we went on to a display of my photographs, showing each stage of the excavations, views of the lower city, the temple, the acropolis and the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Pretty good, Ben,’ Louren admitted. ‘Is that all you have for me?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The best comes last.’ I couldn’t help a little showmanship in my presentation, and I had screened off the end of the warehouse. I led him beyond the first screen with all my team hovering anxiously to judge his reaction. It was gratifying.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good God!’ Louren stopped short and stared at the phallic columns with their ornamental tops. ‘Zimbabwe birds!’</p>

  <p class="normal">There were three of them. Although incomplete, they stood about five foot high, and were thirty inches in circumference. Only one of them was relatively undamaged, the other two had been mutilated so as to be hardly recognizable. The carving on top of each pillar had obviously originally depicted a vulturine bird shape with heavy beak, hunched shoulders, and predatory claws. They were similar in design and execution to those recovered from Zimbabwe by Hall, Maclver, and others.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not Zimbabwe birds,’ I corrected Louren.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ Sally affirmed. ‘These are the ones from which the Zimbabwe birds were copied.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where did you find them?’ Louren asked as he moved in for a closer scrutiny of the green soapstone figures.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘In the temple,’ I smiled at Ral and Leslie, who looked suitably modest, ‘within the inner enclosure. They are probably religious objects - you see the sun symbols around the collar of the column - clearly they are associated with the worship of Baal as the sun god.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘We have named them the sunbirds,’ Sally explained, ‘as Ben felt a name like the birds of Ophir was a bit too pretentious.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Why have they been damaged like this?’ Louren indicated where deliberate blows had shattered the brittle green stone.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s anybody’s guess.’ I shrugged away the question. ‘But we know that they had been toppled and were lying without design or direction in the layer of ash at Level I.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s very interesting, Ben.’ Louren’s eyes were drawn to the final screen at the end of the warehouse. ‘Now come on, you secretive old bastard, what have you got behind there?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What the whole city and colonization was based on—’ I opened the screen,‘—gold!’</p>

  <p class="normal">There is something about that beautiful buttery metal that holds the imagination captive. A hush came over the party as we stared at it. The objects had been carefully cleaned, and the surfaces shone with the special soft radiance which is unmistakably gold.</p>

  <p class="normal">To coldly itemize the collection detracts in some way from its excitement and mystery. The gross weight of the pieces was 683 fine ounces. There were fifteen rods of native gold as thick and as long as a man’s finger. There were forty-eight pieces of crudely wrought jewellery, pins, brooches and combs. There was a statuette of a female figure four and a half inches tall—</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Astarte - Tanith,’ Sally whispered as she stroked it, ‘Goddess of the moon and the earth.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In addition there were a handful of gold beads with the string long ago disintegrated, dozens of sun discs and many chips, tacks and flakes and buttons of no definite shape or discernible purpose.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And then,’ I said, ‘there is this,’ picking up the heavy chalice of solid gold. It had been crushed and flattened, but the base was undamaged. ‘Look,’ I said, pointing to the design worked into it with uncommon delicacy of line.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ankh? The Egyptian sign of eternal life?’ Louren looked to me for confirmation, and I nodded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘For the Christians and heathens amongst you. We know that the Pharaohs on occasions used the Phoenicians to supply treasure for their empire. Was this,’ and I turned the chalice in my hands, ‘a gift from a Pharaoh to the King of Ophir?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And do you remember the cup in the right hand of the White Lady of the Brandberg?’ Sally asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was enough to keep us arguing and locked in discussion into the early hours, and the next day Sally, helped by Heather Willcox, presented her drawings and paintings from the cavern. When she showed the tracing of the white king, that frown of concentration again creased Louren’s brow, and he stood up and went to examine it more closely. We waited for a long time in silence, before he looked up at Sally.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I would like you to make a copy of this, for my own personal collection. Would you mind?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘With the greatest of pleasure.’ Sally smiled happily at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">The mood of sparkle and smile was still strong upon her and she was enjoying the sensation that the display of her work was causing. Sally, like most beautiful women, is not completely averse to standing in the limelight. She knew her work was damned good, and she liked the plaudits.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Now I haven’t been able to decide what these are.’ Sally smiled as she hung a new sheet on the common-room board. ‘There are seventeen symbols similar to this which I have so far isolated. Heather calls them the walking cucumbers, or the double walking cucumbers. Have you any ideas?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tadpoles?’ Ral tried.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Centipedes?’ Leslie was a bit more feasible.</p>

  <p class="normal">That was the end of our imagination, and we were silent.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No more offers?’ Sally asked. ‘I thought that with the formidable collection of academic qualification and worldly wisdom we have assembled here we could do better—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A bireme!’ Louren said softly. ‘And a trireme.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘By Jove.’ I saw it immediately. ‘You’re right!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘ “Quinquereme of Nineveh, from distant Ophir,”’ Peter quoted joyously.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The shape of a ship’s hull, and the banks of oars,’ I enlarged upon it. ‘Of course - if we are right then vessels like that must have plied regularly across the lakes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We could accept it, but others certainly would not.</p>

  <p class="normal">After lunch we went for a tour of the excavations, and Louren again distinguished himself with an inspired guess. A series of large regular cell-like rooms had been uncovered by Peter’s team in the angle formed by the cliff and the enclosure wall. They were joined by a long corridor, and there was evidence of paved floors and a system of drainage. Each room was approximately twenty-five feet square, and it seemed that these were the only buildings outside the enclosure which had been made of stone blocks and not adobe clay.</p>

  <p class="normal">The closest we could come to a purpose for these cells was to call them ‘the prison’.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do I have to do all the work around here?’ Louren sighed. ‘When you’ve just shown me pictures of the war elephants?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Elephant stables?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Very quick, lad!’ Louren clapped me on the shoulder and I blushed. ‘But I believe they are called elephant lines in India.’</p>

  <p class="normal">After dinner I worked for an hour in my dark room, developing three rolls of film, and when I was finished I went to look for Louren. He was leaving again early the following morning and there was much for us to discuss.</p>

  <p class="normal">He wasn’t in the guest room, nor in the lounge, and when I asked for him, Ral told me, ‘I think he has gone up to the cavern, Doctor. He borrowed a torch from me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Leslie looked at him in a way which was clearly meant to be highly significant, a frown and a quick little shake of the head, but it meant as much to him as it did to me. I went to fetch my own torch, and set off through the silent grove, picking my way carefully around the open excavations. No light showed from the entrance of the tunnel beyond the great wild fig tree.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren!’ I called. ‘Are you there?’ And my voice bounced hollowly from cliff and rock. There was silence once the echoes died, and I went forward into the tunnel. Flashing my torch into the darkness ahead, ducking my head under the zooming flight of the bats, and hearing my own footsteps magnified in the silence.</p>

  <p class="normal">I could see no light, and I stopped and called again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren!’ My voice boomed around the cavern. There was no reply, and I went on down the passage.</p>

  <p class="normal">As I stepped out from the mouth of the tunnel, suddenly the beam of a powerful torch flashed from across the cavern shining full in my eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Louren?’ I asked. ‘It that you?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What do you want, Ben?’ he demanded from the darkness behind the torch. He sounded irritable, angry even.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want to talk to you about the plans for the next step.’ I shielded my eyes from the beam.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It can wait until tomorrow.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You are leaving early - let’s talk now.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I started to cross the cavern towards him, averting my eyes from the dazzling beam.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Point that light somewhere else, won’t you,’ I protested mildly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you deaf!’ Louren’s voice rasped, the voice of a man used to being obeyed. ‘I said tomorrow, damn you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I stopped dead, stunned, confused. He had never spoken to me like that in my life before.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lo, are you all right?’ I asked anxiously. There was something wrong here in the cavern. I could sense it.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben,’ his voice crackled, ‘just turn around and walk out of here, will you. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I hesitated a moment longer. Then I turned and walked back down the passage. I hadn’t even had a glimpse of Louren in the darkness beyond the torch.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the morning Louren was as charming as only he can be. He apologized handsomely for the previous evening. ‘I just wanted to be alone, Ben. I’m sorry. I get like that sometimes.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know, Lo. I am the same.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In ten minutes we had agreed that although the circumstantial evidence of a Phoenician occupation of the city was most encouraging, it was not conclusive. We would not make any public announcement yet, but in the meantime Louren gave me complete <em>carte blanche</em> to proceed with a full-scale excavation and investigation.</p>

  <p class="normal">He flew out with the dawn, and I knew he would be in London for breakfast the following morning.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The weeks that followed Louren’s departure were dissatisfying for me. Although the work on the ruins went forward steadily, and my assistants never faltered in their enthusiasm and industry - yet the results were uniformly disappointing.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were other finds, many of them, but they were repetitive. Pottery, beads, even the occasional gold fragment or ornament no longer thrilled me as it had before. There was nothing that added a scrap of knowledge to the store we had accumulated already. I roved the site restlessly, anxiously hovering over a new trench or exposed level, praying that the next spadeful of earth turned would expose an inscribed pallet or the headstone to a burial vault. Somewhere here was the key to the ancient mystery, but it was well hidden.</p>

  <p class="normal">Apart from the lack of progress on the excavation, my relationship with Sally had deteriorated in some subtle fashion which I was at a loss to explain. Naturally there had been no opportunity for any physical intimacy since the arrival of the others at the City of the Moon. Sally was adamant in her determination not to allow our affair to become common knowledge. My amateurish manoeuvrings to get her alone were deftly countered. The nearest I came to success was when I visited her at the cavern during the day. Even here she had her assistant with her, and often Heather Willcox as well.</p>

  <p class="normal">She seemed withdrawn, taciturn, even surly. She worked over her easel with a fierce concentration during the day, and she usually slipped away to her hut immediately after dinner. Once I followed her, knocking softly on the door of her hut, then hesitantly pushing the door open when there was no reply. She was not there. I waited in the shadows, feeling like a peeping Tom, and it was after midnight before she returned, slipping out of the silent grove like a ghost and going directly to her room where Leslie had long ago switched out the light.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was distressing for me to see my laughing Sally so withdrawn, and finally I visited her at the cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I want to talk to you, Sal.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What about?’ She looked at me with mild surprise, as though it were the first time in days that she had noticed me. I sent the young African assistant away and prevailed on Sally to join me on the rocks beside the emerald pool, hoping that its beauty and associations would soften her mood.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is something wrong, Sal?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good Lord, should there be?’ It was an awkward unsatisfying conversation. Sally seemed to feel I was prying into affairs that did not concern me. I felt my anger rising, and I wanted to shout at her, ‘I am your lover, damn you, and everything you do concerns me!’</p>

  <p class="normal">But good sense prevailed, for I am sure presumption of that magnitude from me would have severed the last tenuous threads of our relationship. Instead I took her hand and, hating myself for the blush that burned my cheeks, I told her softly, ‘I love you, Sally. Just remember that - if there is ever anything I can do—’</p>

  <p class="normal">I think it was probably the best thing I could have said, for immediately her hand tightened on mine and her face softened, her eyes went slightly misty.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Ben, you are a sweet dear person. Don’t take any notice of me for a while. I’ve just got the blues, there is nothing anybody can do about it. They will go on their own, if you don’t fuss.’</p>

  <p class="normal">For a moment she was my old girl again, a smile quivering precariously on the corners of her mouth, and in those great green eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Let me know when it’s over, won’t you?’ I stood up.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That I will, Doctor. You’ll be the first to know.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The following week I flew back to Johannesburg. There was the Annual General Meeting of the trustees of the Institute which I could not avoid, and I was committed to a series of lectures for the Faculty of Archaeology at the University of Witwatersrand.</p>

  <p class="normal">I was scheduled to be away from the site for eleven days. I left it all in Peter Willcox’s safe hands, after extracting from him a promise that he would cable me immediately if any new development broke.</p>

  <p class="normal">The three girls fussed around me, packing my case, making a picnic lunch for me to eat on the plane, and lining up to kiss me goodbye at the airstrip. I must admit that I rather enjoyed all the attention.</p>

  <p class="normal">I have often found that living too close to any problem narrows one’s view of the whole. Three hours after leaving the City of the Moon, I made a minor breakthrough. If there had been walls and towers standing on the ruined foundations, then the rock must have been brought from nearby. The obvious place was from the cliffs themselves. Somewhere in those cliffs, close to the city, there was a quarry.</p>

  <p class="normal">I would find it, and from its extent I would calculate the actual size of the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time in weeks I felt good, and the days that followed were gratifying and solidly enjoyable. The meeting of the trustees was the type of festive affair which can be expected when funds are unlimited and prospects are favourable. From the Chair Louren was most complimentary when he renewed my contract as Director of the Institute for a further twelve months. To celebrate the thirty per cent rise in my remuneration, he invited me to a dinner at his home where forty people sat down at the yellow wood table in the huge dining-room, and I was the guest of honour.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hilary Sturvesant, in a gown of yellow brocade silk and wearing the fabled Sturvesant diamonds, gave me her almost undivided attention during the meal. I have a weakness for beautiful things, particularly if they are women. There were twenty of them there that night, and in the drawing-room afterwards I held court like royalty. The wine had loosened my tongue, and washed away my confounded shyness. No matter that Hilary and Louren had probably primed the other guests to make a fuss of me, for when at two o’clock in the morning I went down to the Mercedes with Hilary and Louren escorting me I swaggered along seven feet tall.</p>

  <p class="normal">This new-found confidence carried me through the series of four lectures at the University of Witwatersrand, the first of which was attended by twenty-five students and faculty members, the latter outnumbering the former two to one. The word got out, however, and my final venue was changed to one of the main lecture theatres to handle the audience of 600 that turned up. I was an unqualified success. I was prevailed upon to return at an early date - and there was an unsubtle hint from the Vice-Chancellor of the University that the Archaeology Chair would fall vacant the following year.</p>

  <p class="normal">For the last three days of my visit I spent every minute at the Institute. With relief I found that not much had suffered in my absence, and my multitudinous staff had kept things running smoothly.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bushman exhibition in the Kalahari Room was completed, and open to the public. It was magnificently executed, and the central figure of the main group reminded me sharply of my little friend Xhai. The model was depicted in the act of painting on the stone wall of a cave abode. With his stoppered buck-horn paint pots, and reed pipes and brushes, I imagined that this was how the artist who had painted my white king had worked. It gave me an odd sensation, as though two millennia had rolled away, as though I could send my mind back along the years. I spoke of it to Timothy Mageba.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, Machane. I have told you before that you and I are marked. We have the sign of the spirits on us, and we have the sight.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I smiled and shook my head. ‘I don’t know about you, Timothy, but I’ve never been able to pick a winner—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am serious, Doctor,’ Timothy rebuked me. You have the gift. It is merely that you have not been taught to develop it.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">I will accept hypnotism, but talk of <span lang="en-US">clairvoyance</span>, necromancy, mantology and the like leaves me feeling embarrassed. To divert the conversation from me and my gifts, I asked, ‘You have told me before that you are also marked by the spirits…’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy looked at me steadily from out of those disturbing black eyes. At first I thought I had insulted him by my thinly disguised question, but suddenly he nodded that cannon-ball head. He stood up, closed and locked the door of his office before returning to his seat. Quickly he stripped shoe and sock from his right foot, and showed it to me.</p>

  <p class="normal">The deformity was shocking, although I had seen photographs of it before. It was of fairly common occurrence among the Batonga tribe of the Zambezi Valley. There had been a paper on it published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> during 1969. The condition was known as ‘ostrich-foot’, and consisted of a massive division between the metatarsus of the big toe and the second toe. The effect was to make the foot resemble the claw of an ostrich or predatory bird. Timothy was obviously very sensitive about this deformity, and almost immediately replaced his sock and shoe. I realized later that he had shown it to me in a deliberate attempt to enlist my sympathy, to create a bond between us.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Both feet?’ I asked, and he nodded. ‘There are many people in the Zambezi Valley with feet like that,’ I told him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My mother was a Batonga woman,’ he answered. ‘It was this mark that qualified me for training in the mysteries.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Does it hinder you at all?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ he answered brusquely, and then went on almost defiantly in Batonga, ‘We men of the cloven feet outrun the fleetest antelope.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was a beneficial mutation then, and I would have enjoyed discussing it further but I was warned by Timothy’s expression. I realized the effort it had taken him to show me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Will you have some tea. Doctor?’ He reverted to English, closing the subject. When one of his young African assistants had poured cups of strong black tea for us, Timothy asked, ‘Please tell me how the work at the City of the Moon is progressing, Doctor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We chatted for another half hour, then I left him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You must excuse me now, Timothy. I am flying back tomorrow morning early and there is still much to do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I was awakened by a soft but insistent knocking on the door of my suite in the Institute. I switched on the bedside light and saw that the time was three o’clock in the morning.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who is there?’ I called and the knocking stopped. I slipped out of bed, shrugged into a dressing-gown and slippers, and started for the front door, when I realized the risk I was taking. I went back to my bedroom and took the big ugly automatic .45 from the drawer. Feeling a little melodramatic, I pumped a round into the chamber and went back to the front door.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Who is it?’ I repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It’s me. Doctor. Timothy!’</p>

  <p class="normal">I hesitated a moment longer - anybody could call themselves Timothy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you alone?’ I asked in Kalahari bushman.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am alone, Sunbird,’ he answered in the same language, and I slipped the pistol into my pocket and opened the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy was dressed in dark blue slacks and a white shirt with a windcheater thrown over his shoulders and I noticed immediately that there were spots of fresh blood on the shirt and that there was a rather grubby cloth wrapped around his left forearm. He was clearly much agitated, his eyes wide and staring in the light, and his movements jerky and nervous.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good God, Timothy, are you all right?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ve had a terrible night, Doctor. I had to see you right away.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What have you done to your arm?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I cut it on the window pane of my front door, I fell in the dark,’ he explained.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’d better let me have a look at it.’ I went towards him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, Doctor. It’s only a scratch What I have come to tell you is more important.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sit down at least,’ I told him. ‘Can I get you a drink?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘A drink, thank you, Machane, as you can see I am upset and nervous. That is how I came to injure my arm.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I poured both of us whisky, and he took his glass in his right hand and continued moving nervously around my sitting-room while I sat in one of the big leather armchairs.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What is it, Timothy?’ I prompted him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It is difficult to begin, Machane, for you are not a believer. But I must convince you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">He broke off and drank whisky, before turning to face me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yesterday evening we spoke at length about the City of the Moon. Doctor, you told me how there are mysteries there that still baffle you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’ I nodded encouragement.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The burial grounds of the ancients,’ Timothy went on ‘You cannot find them.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That is true, Timothy.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Since then I have thought heavily on this matter.’ He changed into Venda, a language better suited for the discussion of the occult. ‘I went back in my memory over all the legends of our people.’ I imagined vividly how he must have thrown himself into hypnotic trance to search. ‘And there was something there, like a shadow beyond the firelight, a dark memory that eluded me.’ He shook his head and turned away, pacing restlessly, sipping at his drink, muttering softly to himself as though he still searched in the dark archives of his mind.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It was no use, Doctor. I knew it was there, but I could not grasp it. I despaired of it, and at last I slept. But it was a sleep greatly troubled by the dream demons - until at last…’ he hesitated, ‘… my grandfather came to me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I stirred uneasily in my chair. Timothy’s grandfather had <span lang="en-US">lain</span> twenty-five years in a murderer’s grave.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right. Doctor.’ Timothy saw my small movement of disbelief, and changed smoothly to English. ‘I know you do not believe such things can happen. Let me explain it in terms you can accept. My imagination, heated by my search for a long-forgotten fragment of knowledge, threw up a dream image of my grandfather. The one from whom the knowledge was learned in the first place.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I smiled to cover my spooky feelings; at this time of night with this half-demented black man talking of dark things, I felt myself falling under his spell.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Go on, Timothy.’ I tried to say it lightly, but my voice croaked a little.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My grandfather came to me, and he touched my shoulder and he said. “Go with the blessed one, to the Hills of Blood and there I will make the mysteries known to you and open up the secret places.”’</p>

  <p class="normal">I felt my skin prickle. Timothy had said ‘The Hills of Blood’, and nobody had told him that name.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The Hills of Blood,’ I repeated.</p>

  <p class="normal">That is the name he used,‘ Timothy agreed. ’I can only believe he meant your City of the Moon.‘</p>

  <p class="normal">I was silent; reasonable man at war with primitive superstitious man within me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You want to come with me tomorrow, Timothy?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I will go with you,’ Timothy agreed. ‘And perhaps I will be able to show you something for which you search - then again I may not be able to.’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was certainly nothing to lose. Timothy was obviously sincere, he was still tense and nervously aware.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have already invited you to join me, Timothy, and I was very disappointed when you refused. Of course you may come with me - we can certainly see if the sight of the ruins stirs something in your memory.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thank you, Doctor. What time will you leave?’</p>

  <p class="normal">I glanced at my watch.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Good Lord, it’s four o’clock already. We will leave at six.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Then I must hurry home and pack.’ Timothy replaced his glass on my cabinet, then he turned to me. ‘There is a small snag, Doctor. My travel papers have expired and we will have to cross an international border into Botswana.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, damn it,’ I muttered, deeply disappointed. ‘You will have to get them renewed and come up with me on the next trip.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘As you wish, Doctor,’ he agreed readily. ‘Of course, it will take two or three weeks - and by then the whole thing might have faded from my memory.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes.’ I nodded, but I felt a prick of temptation. I am usually a law-abiding person, but now as I thought about it I saw that no harm could come from what I intended. The chance that Timothy might lead me to the burial grounds of the ancients was worth any risk.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Would you like to take a chance, Timothy?’ I asked. Formalities concerned with the coming and going of Sturvesant aircraft had been reduced to a minimum. There were daily arrivals and departures, and a phone call to the airport authorities was all that was necessary before departure. The Sturvesant name carried such weight, that there was never a head count on arrival or departure. At the City of the Moon Louren had arranged special status with the Botswana Government, and we were virtually free from bothersome red tape.</p>

  <p class="normal">I could have Timothy in and out within three days with nobody the wiser and no damage done. Roger van Deventer would accept my word that Louren had sanctioned the flight. I could see no problems.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Very well, Doctor, if you think it’s safe.’ Timothy agreed to my proposal.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Be at the Sturvesant hangar before six.’ I sat down to scribble a note. ‘If you are questioned at the airport gate, which I doubt, show them this. It’s a note authorizing you to deliver goods to the Sturvesant hangar. Park your car behind the flight office, and wait for me in the office.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Quickly we made our arrangements, and when I stood at the window of my bedroom and watched Timothy’s old blue Chevy pull out of the Institute car park I felt a mixture of elation and apprehension. Idly I wondered what the penalty was for aiding illegal exit and entry, then dismissed the thought and went to make myself some coffee.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy’s Chevy was in one of the parking bays when Roger van Deventer and I drove up in the Mercedes. We went through into the hangar. The big sliding doors were open and the ground crew was readying the Dakota for the flight, and through the glass doors of the flight office <em>I</em> saw Timothy sitting hunched at the desk. He looked up and smiled at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll get the clearance, Roger,’ I suggested smoothly. ‘You go and start the engines.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, Doctor.’ He handed me the flight dossier. We had done this before, and I had banked on the same procedure. Roger climbed up through the door of the fuselage, while I went quickly into the office.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hello, Timothy.’ I looked at him and felt a twinge of concern. He was huddled into his blue windcheater, and there were lines of pain cut into his forehead and the corners of his nostrils. His skin was grey and his lips pale purplish blue. ‘Are you all right?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My arm is a little painful, Doctor.’ He opened the front of his jacket. The arm was in a sling, freshly bandaged. ‘But it will be all right. I’ve had it attended to.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you feel up to this trip?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’ll be all right, Doctor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you sure?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, I’m sure.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All right, then.’ I sat down at the desk and picked up the phone. It was answered at the first ring.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Airport police!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is Dr Kazin - from Sturvesant, Africa.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Oh, good morning, Doctor. How are you this morning?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Fine, thank you. I want to clear a flight to Botswana on ZA-CEE.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold on, Doctor. Let me get the particulars. Who are the passengers?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘One passenger, myself - and the pilot is Roger van Deventer as usual.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I dictated while the constable on the other end took it down in laborious shorthand. Until finally he said: ‘That’s okay, Doctor. Have a good flight. I’ll give your clearance to control.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I hung up and smiled at Timothy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘All clear.’ I stood up. ‘Let’s go.’ And I led the way out of the office. The engines of the Dakota were ticking over. The three black ground crew inexplicably left their positions beside the landing gear and began walking rapidly towards me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Doctor!’ Timothy’s voice behind me, and I turned back towards him. It took me four or five seconds to realize that he had a short-barrelled Chinese model machine-pistol in his uninjured hand and the muzzle was pointing into my belly, I gaped at him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am sorry, Doctor,’ he said softly, ‘but it is necessary.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The ground crew closed in on each side of me, they gripped my arms.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Please believe me, Doctor, when I tell you that I will not hesitate to kill you if you do not cooperate,’ He raised his voice without taking his eyes off me. ‘Come.’ he called in Venda.</p>

  <p class="normal">Five others came through the outer door of the hangar. I immediately recognized two of the young Bantu assistants from the Institute, and one of the girls. All of them carried those stubby, lethal-looking machine-pistols and between them they supported a badly wounded stranger. His feet, dangled loosely, and blood-soaked bandages covered his chest and neck.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get him into the plane,’ Timothy ordered crisply.</p>

  <p class="normal">All this time I had stood dumbly, paralysed with shock, but now the party carrying the wounded man squeezed past between my captors and the side wall. They were blanketing each others’ line of fire, the whole group was off balance and at that moment I regained my wits. I braced my legs, leaned forward slightly and heaved. The men on my arms shot forward like thrown darts, crashing headlong into Timothy and knocking him down in a floundering heap.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Roger!’ I shouted, ‘Radio! Get help!’ Hoping my voice would carry over the sound of the aircraft engines. The third ground crew leaped on my back, one arm locking around my throat. I reached up, took him at wrist and elbow and wrenched against the joint. His elbow went with a rubbery popping sound and he screamed like a girl, his arm loose and flabby in my grip.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Don’t shoot,’ shouted Timothy. ‘No noise.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Help!’ I screamed, the engines drowning my cry. They dropped the wounded man and came at me. I ducked and went in low. I kicked for the groin of the leader, and felt my boot sock into him, fleshy and soft. He doubled over and I swung my other knee up into his face. It crunched as the gristle of his nose collapsed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy and the ground crew were scrambling to their feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No shooting.’ Timothy’s voice was desperate. ‘No noise.’ I went for him. Leopard-mad with rage, hating him for this betrayal, with the full strength of my being, wanting to see his blood splash and feel his bones break in my hands.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the girls hit me with the steel butt of the machine-pistol, as I brushed past her. I felt the sharp edge of it cut into the flesh of my scalp, it threw me off balance. One of the ground crew grappled with me, and I took him to my chest and hugged him. He screamed, and I felt his ribs buckling in my grip.</p>

  <p class="normal">They hit me again, steel biting into the bone of my skull. Blood poured warmly down my face, blinding me. My arms went soft, I dropped the man I was crushing and turned to charge into the others. Blinded with my own blood, my maniacal roars deafening me, they hit me again, crowding around me as I <span lang="en-US">flailed</span> and groped for them. The blows rained on my head and my shoulders. My knees collapsed, and I went down. I was still conscious, hot waves of anger buoying me. The boots started then, crashing into my chest and belly. I doubled up, blind, rolled into a ball on the cold oily concrete, trying to ride that storm of booted feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Enough, leave him.’ Timothy’s voice, ‘Get him to the aircraft.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My arm. I’ll kill him.’ The voice pig-squealing with agony.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Stop that,’ Timothy again, and the sound of a palm slapping against a face. ‘We need hostages. Get him into the plane.’</p>

  <p class="normal">They dragged me across the floor, many hands. I was lifted and thrown heavily onto the metal floor of the fuselage. The door slammed closed, muting the engine noise.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Tell the pilot to take off,’ Timothy ordered, ‘Get the Doctor into the radio compartment.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I was hustled down the length of the aisle. Blinking the blood out of my eyes, I saw the white ground engineer and his black ground crew lying bound and gagged against the wall of the fuselage. They were stripped of their overalls, which the gang had used to impersonate them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rough hands forced me into the steel chair in the radio compartment, and they tied me so tightly that the ropes bit painfully into my flesh. My face felt swollen and numb, and the taste of my own blood was thick and metallic in my mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">I turned my head, looking into the cockpit. Roger van Deventer was at the controls. There was a livid red swelling under his eye, and his grey hair was rumpled, his face pale and terrified. One of them stood over him with the muzzle of a machine-pistol pressed firmly against the back of his head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Take off,’ instructed Timothy, ‘Observe all routine procedures. Do you understand?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Roger nodded jerkily. I felt sorry for him, I had guessed he was not cast in the heroic mould.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sorry, Doctor,’ he tried to explain. ‘They jumped me the moment I stepped aboard.’ His full attention was on the job of taxiing the big aircraft out onto the still dark airfield. He did not look at me. ‘I didn’t have a chance.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That’s all right, Roger. I didn’t do so good either,’ I replied thickly. ‘I only got in two good licks.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That is enough talking for now, please, Doctor. Mr van Deventer must attend to the business of take-off,’ Timothy admonished me, and I turned to give him the most expressive glare of hatred that I could force from my numbed features.</p>

  <p class="normal">Roger asked for and received control clearance, and the take-off was routine and uneventful. The tense, anxious black faces relaxed and there were a few nervous laughs.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You will fly on course for Botswana,’ Timothy instructed Roger. ‘Once you are over the border I will give you a new course.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Roger nodded stiffly, the machine-pistol still held at his head. I was assessing the strength of the gang, I had already formed a working idea of their motives. Apart from Timothy and the eight who had overwhelmed me, there were five others. These were the ones who had captured and guarded Roger and the ground crew. The wounded man and the two I had damaged were <span lang="en-US">laid</span> out on the floor of the cargo hold. The two girls were working over them, both girls from the Institute, they were fitting a splint and changing bloody bandages.</p>

  <p class="normal">As I watched, the gang members began changing from civilian clothing into camouflage paratrooper battledress. I saw the red star shoulder flashes, and my last doubts were dispelled. I turned my head and found Timothy was watching me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, Doctor.’ He nodded. ‘Soldiers of freedom.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Or the bringers of darkness, depending how you look at it.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy frowned at my retort. ‘I had always believed you to be a man of humanity, Doctor. You, I would have expected, could understand and sympathize with our aspirations.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I find it hard to sympathize with gangsters carrying guns in their hands.’</p>

  <p class="normal">We stared at each other for a few moments. Then abruptly he stood up and came to the radio equipment beside my chair. He switched on the set, glanced at his watch, and began sweeping the bands. The station came on loudly, and immediately all movement in the aircraft arrested, all attention fixed on the announcer’s voice:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The time is seven o’clock and here is the news. A spokesman for the South African Police states that at 2.15 AM this morning a detachment of the Security Police, acting on information received, raided a farm house on the outskirts of Randberg, a suburb of Johannesburg. A pitched battle between police and a large gang of unidentified persons armed with automatic weapons ensued. Elements of the gang escaped in four motor-cars, and after a chase by the police, two vehicles managed to evade pursuit. Initial reports are that eight of the gang were shot dead, and four were captured wounded or unhurt. It is anticipated that many of those escaping were also wounded. A full-scale police hunt is now in progress, and all roads out of the Witwatersrand area are under surveillance, together with all airports. It is with deep regret that we announce the death of three members of the South African Police Force, and the critical wounding of two—’</p>

  <p class="normal">A ragged cheer rang out through the aircraft, and one or two of the gang clenched their fists over their heads in the Communist salute.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Congratulations,’ I murmured sarcastically to Timothy and he looked down at me.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Death is ugly, slavery is worse,’ he said evenly. ‘Doctor, there is a bond between us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘My head is sore, my face is too painful to listen to your Communistic cant,’ I told him. ‘Don’t give me fancy words, you bastard. You want to burn my land and soak it in blood. You want to tear down everything I hold dear and sacred. It is my country and with all its faults I love it. You are my enemy. There is no bond between us - except that of the knife.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Again we held each other’s eyes for a long moment, then he nodded. ‘To the knife then,’ he agreed and turned away. The Dakota bore on steadily into the north, and my injuries began to ache. I closed my eyes, and rode the long dizzy swells of pain that rose up out of my guts and exploded in my head.</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">The Mirage jet came up out of the east and flashed silvery sleek across our nose, and as it passed with incredible speed I saw the Air Force roundels and the goggled face of the pilot staring at us. Then it was gone, but immediately the Tannoy crackled into life.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘ZA-CEE. This is Air Force Red Striker Two. Do you read me?’ I stared out of the window beside my head, and saw the Mirage turn sparkling in the sunlight high above us. Timothy came running forward to the set beside me and stared at it for a moment. The atmosphere was hushed and tense. Timothy could not reply, his Bantu accent was too thick for deception.</p>

  <p class="normal">Again the jet howled across our front. The gunman crouched low behind Roger’s seat hidden from view.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘ZA-CEE.’ Again the call was repeated. Timothy was sweating lightly, his face blue-grey with strain and the pain of the arm wound. He turned from the set and motioned to two of his men.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Bring him,’ he pointed to the white ground engineer. They dragged him into the radio compartment and held him in front of me. His face was pale and shiny with sweat, his terrified eyes held mine in pitiful appeal, the gag cut into his mouth. One of them stood behind him and pulled his head back, exposing his throat and stretching the pale skin so that the arteries showed blue and pulsing. He reached around in front of the man, and <span lang="en-US">laid</span> the glistening blade of a trench knife against his throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I am serious, Doctor.’ Timothy assured me as he freed the rope from my arms and put the microphone of the radio transmitter into my hand. ‘Reassure them. Tell them there are only two aboard, and that you are bound for the City of the Moon on a routine flight.’ He placed his finger on the transmit switch of the set ready to cut it off.</p>

  <p class="normal">The terrified engineer moaned into his gag, the knife pressed to the softly throbbing skin of his throat. They pushed him towards me, closer so that I could see his face clearly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Air Force Striker Two this is ZA-CEE standing by.’ I croaked into the mike, staring fascinated into the engineer’s terrified face.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Report your complement and destination.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘This is Dr Kazin of Sturvesant, Africa on a routine flight from—’ As I spoke I saw them relax, the tension eased and Timothy’s hand moved from the transmit switch of the set. The engineer’s eyes held mine and I wanted to tell him that I was sorry, that I wished I could save him. I wanted to explain that I was trading his life for those of fourteen of my country’s most dangerous enemies, that the sacrifice was worthwhile, and that I would willingly add my own life to the price. Instead I shouted into the handset:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hi-jacked by terrorists! Fire into us! Disregard our safety.’ Timothy’s hand darted to the transmit switch, and at the same moment he turned towards the hostage. I think he was going to intervene, to try and stop it. He was too late.</p>

  <p class="normal">The knife slashed across the tensed throat, slitting it deeply beneath the line of the jaw. The blood burst forth like a ruptured garden hose, it sprayed out in a red fountain that drenched both Timothy and me. It pumped in great liquid jets that splashed against the foot of the cabin, then dribbled in thick cords and strings to the floor. The engineer was keening a high wailing sound like steam from a kettle, and the air from his lungs burst from the severed windpipe in a pink froth, that spattered the radio set.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Tannoy was squawking, ‘Reverse your course! Conform to me! Conform to me immediately, or I will fire into you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy was cursing as he wrestled the microphone out of my hands: I was screaming and fighting against the ropes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You animals! You filthy murdering bloody animals.’</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the gang lifted his machine-pistol to hit me in the face, but Timothy knocked his arm away.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Get him out of here!’ He jerked his head towards the still twitching, kicking corpse of the engineer - and they dragged him out into the cargo hold.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Mirage is attacking!’ shouted Roger, from the cockpit, and we saw it coming from ahead of us, a silvery flash as it bore in on a head-on interception course.</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy snatched the microphone to his mouth. I saw that his face was speckled with the engineer’s blood.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold your fire!’ he shouted. ‘We have hostages aboard.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Attack!’ I screamed, tearing and jerking at my bonds. ‘They’ll murder us anyway! Open fire!’</p>

  <p class="normal">The Mirage jet pulled up steeply ahead of us, without opening fire, and howled a few feet over our heads. The Dakota rocked violently in the slipstream. I was still screaming and struggling to tear myself loose. I wanted to get at them. The steel chair was rocking from side to side. I got my feet against the side of the fuselage and heaved with all my strength. The seat buckled a little, and again the guard lifted his machine-pistol.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No,’ shouted Timothy. ‘We need him alive. Tell Mary to bring the morphine.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The Mirage sheered off, then circled to take up station a hundred feet off our starboard wingtip, I could see the pilot staring helplessly across the gap at us.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You have spoken to Dr Kazin,’ Timothy warned the pilot of the jet. ‘And we have four other hostages. We have already executed one white hostage and we will not hesitate to execute another if you take any further hostile action.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘They’re going to kill us anyway,’ I shouted, but Timothy broke the contact.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took five of them to hold me still for the hypodermic, but at last they got it into my arm, and though I tried to resist the drug, I felt myself going muzzy and misty. I tried to maintain my struggle, but my movements became lethargic and uncoordinated and slowly I drifted off into unconsciousness. My last waking memory was hearing Timothy giving Roger a new course to fly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Pain and thirst woke me. My mouth was thick and scummy and my head was a mass of solid blinding agony. I tried to sit up and cried out aloud.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you all right, Doctor? Take it easy.’ Roger van Deventer’s voice, and I focused my eyes on him.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Water?’ I asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sorry, Doc.’ He shook his head, and I looked around the bare whitewashed room. Four wooden bunks and a lavatory bucket were all the furnishings, and the door was barred and grilled. The three Bantu ground crew sat on one of the bunks across the room, looking lost and unhappy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Where are we?’ I whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Zambia. Some sort of military camp. We landed an hour ago-’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What happened to the Air Force jet?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘It turned back when we crossed the Zambezi. Nothing they could do.’</p>

  <p class="normal">And there was nothing we could do, either. For five days we sat in the airless, oven-like room with its stinking bucket, until on the fifth day our guards came to fetch me. With much shouting and many unnecessary shoves and blows I was marched down a corridor and into a sparsely furnished office whose main furnishing was a portrait of Chairman Mao. Timothy Mageba rose from behind the desk and motioned my guards to leave.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Sit down, Doctor, please.’ He wore paratrooper camouflage, and the bars and stars of a Colonel in the Chinese People’s Army.</p>

  <p class="normal">I sat on the wooden bench, and my eyes fastened on the half-dozen bottles of Tusker beer that stood on a tray. The bottles were bedewed with cold, and I felt my throat contracting.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I know how fond you are of a bottle of cold beer, Doctor.’ Timothy opened one of the bottles, and offered it to me, I shook my head.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No, thank you. I don’t drink with murderers.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I see.’ He nodded, and I saw the little shadows of regret in those dark brooding eyes. He lifted the bottle to his own lips and drank a mouthful. I watched him thirstily.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘The engineer,’ he said, ‘the execution, it was not intended. I did not mean it to happen. Please understand that, Doctor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes. I understand. And when the smoke of our burning land blackens the skies, and the stink of our dead sickens even your dark spirits, will you cry out, <em>I did</em> not mean it to <em>ha</em>ppen?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy turned away and went to stand at the window, looking out over a parade ground where squads of uniformed Bantu drilled under a dazzling sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I have been able to arrange for your release, Doctor. You will be allowed to return in the Dakota.’ He came back to stand before me, and then he changed from English into Venda. ‘My heart cries out to see you go, Machane, for you are a man of gentleness, and strength, and great courage. Once I hoped that you might join us.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In Venda I answered, ‘My heart weeps also, for a man who was a friend, one I trusted, one who I believed was a man of goodwill, but he is gone now into the half-world of the criminals and the destroyers He is dead to me, and my heart weeps.’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was true, I realized. It was not just an attempt to shame him. Beneath my hatred and anger, there was a sense of sorrow, of loss. I had believed in him. I had seen in a man such as he was, a hope for the future of this poor tormented continent of ours. We looked at each other wistfully, regretfully across a space of four feet that was as wide as the span of the heavens and as deep as the chasms of Hell.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Goodbye, Doctor,’ he said softly. ‘Go in peace, Machane.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">They took us in the covered back of a three-ton truck to the airstrip, bare-footed and stripped to our underclothes.</p>

  <p class="normal">They formed a double line from the truck to the Dakota, There were perhaps 200 of them in paratrooper uniform, and we were forced to walk down the narrow aisle with jeering black faces on each side of us. There were Chinese instructors with them, their lank black hair flopping out from under the cloth uniform caps, grinning hugely as we passed. I was bitterly aware of the mocking eyes and jibes aimed at my crooked exposed back, and I hurried towards the refuge of the Dakota, Suddenly one of them stepped out of the ranks in front of me. Deliberately he spat at me, and a storm of laughter went up from them. With a thick gob of yellow phlegm plastered in my hair, I scrambled up into the cabin of the aircraft.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Air Force Mirages picked us up an hour after we crossed the Zambezi river and they escorted us to the military airfield at Voortrekker Hoogte. However, my almost hysterical relief at our safe home-coming was shortlived. Once a doctor had cleaned and dressed the clotted and suppurating gashes in my head, I was hustled away in a closed car to a meeting with four unsmiling, grimly polite, officers of the police and military intelligence.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dr Kazin, is this your signature?’</p>

  <p class="normal">It was my recommendation for the issue of Timothy Mageba’s passport.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Dr Kazin, do you remember this man?’</p>

  <p class="normal">A Chinaman I had met when I visited Timothy at London University.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Are you aware that he is an agent of the Communist Chinese government. Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a photograph of the three of us drinking beer on the tow-path beside the Thames.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can you tell us what you spoke about, please, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Timothy had told me that the Chinaman was an anthropology major, and we had discussed Leakey’s discoveries at Olduvai Gorge.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you recommend Mageba for the Sturvesant travel scholarship, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you know that he went to China and received training as a guerrilla leader?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you sign these order forms for twenty-seven drums of fuller’s earth from Hong Kong, Doctor - and these customs declarations?’</p>

  <p class="normal">They were standard Institute forms, I could recognize my signature on the customs form across the desk. I did not remember the shipment.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Were you aware that this shipment contained 150 lb of plastic explosives, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you recognize these, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Pamphlets in a dozen African languages. I read the first line of one of them. Terrorist propaganda. Exhortations to kill, burn and destroy.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Were you aware that these were printed on your press at the Institute, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">The questions went on endlessly, I was tired, confused, and began contradicting myself. I pointed out the wounds on my head, the rope burns at my wrists and ankles, and the questions went on. My head throbbed, my brain felt like a battered jelly.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you recognize these, Doctor?’</p>

  <p class="normal">Machine-pistols, ammunition.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes!’ I shouted at them. I had pistols like that against my head, in my belly!‘</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Did you know that these were imported in cases of books addressed to your Institute?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘When you obtained police clearance for the Dakota flight, Doctor, you stated—<sup>’</sup></p>

  <p class="normal">‘They jumped me after the phone call, I’ve explained that a dozen times, damn you!’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘You’ve known Mageba for twelve years. He was a protege of yours, Doctor.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Do you mean to tell us that you were never approached by Mageba? Never discussed politics with him?’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I’m not one of them! I swear it—’ I remembered the blood spraying against the cabin roof, the crunch of steel biting into the bone of my skull, the spittle clinging in my hair. ‘You’ve got to believe me, please! Oh God, please!’ And I think I must have fainted, it went all dark and warm in my head and I slumped sideways off the chair onto the floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">I woke in a hospital room, between clean crisp sheets - and Louren Sturvesant sat beside the bed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Lo, oh thank God.’ I felt all choked up with relief. Louren was here, and it would be all right now.</p>

  <p class="normal">He leaned forward, unsmiling, that marvellous face cold and hard as though it had been cast in bronze. ‘They think you were one of the gang. That you set it up, that you were using the Institute as the headquarters for a terrorist organization.’</p>

  <p class="normal">I stared at him, and he went on remorselessly, ‘If you have betrayed me and your country, if you have gone over to our enemies, then you can expect no mercy from me.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Not you also, Lo. I don’t think I can stand that.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Is it true?’ he demanded.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘No!’ I shook my head. ‘No! No!’ And suddenly there were tears streaming down my face and I was shaking and blubbering like a baby. Louren leaned forward and gripped my shoulder hard.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay, Ben.’ He spoke with infinite gentleness and pity. ‘It’s okay, partner. I’ll fix it. It’s all over now, Ben.’</p>

  <p class="normal"><br/><br/></p>

  <p class="normal">Louren would not let me go back to my bachelor quarters at the Institute, and I was installed in a guest suite at Kleine Schuur, the Sturvesant residence.</p>

  <p class="normal">The first night Louren woke me from a screaming nightmare of blood and mocking black faces. He was in a dressing-gown, with his golden curls disordered from sleep. He sat on the side of my bed, and we talked of the good, sane things we had done together and the things we would do together in the future, until at last I slipped off into untroubled sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">For ten lazy, idyllic days I stayed at Kleine Schuur, spoiled by Hilary and fussed by the children, protected from the news-hungry Press, and sheltered from the realities and alarums of the outside world. The bruises faded, the scabs dried and fell away, and I found it more and more difficult to respond to the children’s cry of ‘Story’ with something new. They shouted the punch-lines in chorus, and corrected me on the details. It was time to go back into the stream.</p>

  <p class="normal">In one unpleasant day-long session I told the story of the hijacking at the public inquiry, and afterwards faced the Press of the world. Then Louren flew me north in the Lear jet, back to the City of the Moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the way I told him how I intended to find the stone quarries - and then the tombs of the ancients.</p>

  <p class="normal">When he grinned and told me, ‘That’s the tiger - get in there, boy, and tear the bottom out of it!’ I realized that I had been enthusing and emoting a little. I remembered old Xhai’s imitation of the Sunbird, and put my fluttering hands firmly back in my lap.</p>

  <p class="normal">A hero’s welcome was waiting for me at the City of the Moon, they had followed my adventures on the radio. But now they opened a case of Windhoek beer and sat round me in a circle while I told the whole story again.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘That Timothy, he always gave me a funny feeling.’ Solemnly Sally demonstrated her amazing gift of hindsight. ‘I could have told you there was something fishy about him.’ Then she stood up and came to kiss me on the forehead in front of them all, while I blushed crimson. ‘Anyway, we are glad you’re safe, Ben. We were so worried about you.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The next morning, after I had driven Louren to the airstrip and watched him take off, I went looking for Ral Davidson. I found him in the bottom of a trench measuring a slab of sandstone. He was covered by a skimpy pair of shorts and a mass of hair that almost completely obscured his features, but he was burned a deep mahogany brown by the sun and was lean and fit. I had become very fond of him. We sat on the edge of the trench dangling our feet over the side, and I explained to him about the quarry.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Gee, Doc! Why didn’t we think of that before?’ he enthused. That evening we drew up an elaborate search pattern, with a schedule to enlarge the area of search in expanding spirals each day. Ral’s gang was temporarily withdrawn from the excavations within the temple, and armed with machetes for the assault on the thick, spiny vegetation on top of the cliffs.</p>

  <p class="normal">The whole search was planned like a military operation. I had been dying to find an opportunity to use the walkie-talkie radio sets with which Louren had, unbidden, supplied us. This was it. Ral and I checked the radios, shouting things like ‘Over to you’ and <span lang="en-US">‘Roger!’</span> and ‘Read you five five!’ at each other.</p>

  <p class="normal">Peter Willcox muttered something about ‘boy scouts’, but I think he was a little jealous that he hadn’t been invited to join the search. Leslie and Sally, however, were infected by our enthusiasm and they victualled the expedition with sufficient food and drink to keep an army bloated and drunk for a week. They turned out in a pink dawn, still in their pyjamas and dressing-gowns, Leslie with her hair in curlers, to wave us off and wish us luck. At the head of my gang of stalwarts, laden with food and equipment, feeling a little like Scott or bold Cortez, I led them towards the gap in the cliffs which had become our regular route to the top - and ten hours later, sweaty, bedraggled, scratched by thorns, stung by hippo fly and other insects, broiled by the sun and in a filthy temper, I led them down again.</p>

  <p class="normal">We repeated this routine daily for the next ten days, and on the tenth evening when we paused halfway down the gap in the cliff to rest, Ral suddenly looked at the steep sides of the gap and said in a voice of wonder:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Gee, Doc! This is it!’</p>

  <p class="normal">For ten days we had been using the steps cut by the ancients into their quarry. Thick growth had covered the neat terraces from which they had sawn the red stone. We found some of the half-formed blocks of masonry still <em>in situ</em>, only a little undercut and almost unweathered in this protected gully. The marks of the saws were fresh upon them as though the workmen had laid down their tools the day before, instead of 2000 years ago. Then there were blocks, cut in the rough, and abandoned halfway through the process of dressing. Others were completed, ready for transporting - yet others were in transit, discarded haphazard along the floor of the gully.</p>

  <p class="normal">We cleared the undergrowth from around them and were then able to follow each fascinating step of the process of manufacture. The whole team came up to assist. They were jubilant with this new success, for we had all been a little put down with the recent total lack of progress. We sketched and mapped, measured and photographed, argued and theorized, and there was an evident renaissance of enthusiasm in all of us. The feeling that we had reached a dead end in the investigation was dispelled. I have a photograph, taken by one of the Bantu foremen who thought us all mad. We are clowning it up, posing on one of the bigger blocks of masonry. Peter strikes a Napoleonic attitude, hand in the breast of his jacket. Ral’s hairy visage is adorned with a ferocious squint, and he poises a pick-axe murderously above Peter’s head. Leslie is coyly showing a little cheesecake, and that is almost as bad as Ral’s squint, with those legs she could kick elephants to death. I am sitting on Heather’s lap, sucking my thumb. Sally has Peter’s glasses on her nose and my hat pulled down over her ears, she is trying to look hideous, but failing resoundingly. This photograph illustrates the mood of those days.</p>

  <p class="normal">After their assistance was no longer needed, the others went back to their separate tasks with renewed energy. Ral and I stayed on in the quarry. I brought up my theodolite and we set about calculating its extent and the amount of masonry removed from it. It was impossible to measure accurately the irregular excavation, but we decided that approximately a million and a half cubic yards of rock had been removed.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then by a study of the method of quarrying and using the volume of abandoned blocks as a very rough guide, we guessed that the ratio of dressed finished blocks to waste material would be about 40 :60. Finally we arrived at a figure of 600,000 cubic yards.</p>

  <p class="normal">Up to this point we had been working with fairly factual figures, but now we pushed off into an ocean of conjecture.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘At least it’s not as bad as drawing a dinosaur from its footprints,’ Ral defended us, as we used the map of the foundations of the temple together with our calculation of rock volumes to reconstruct a complete elevation of the vanished City of the Moon.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Here, let me do that!’ Irritably Sally took the paint brush out of my hand on the first evening, after she had watched my efforts for ten minutes.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘I think the batter of the main walls is a little excessive,’ Peter murmured critically, watching her, ‘if you compare the walls of the elliptical building at Zimbabwe—’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, but take the temple of Tarxien at Malta,’ Heather interceded. ‘Or the main walls of Knossos.’ And before Ral and I could do a thing to prevent it, the project had become a group effort that replaced the nightly song-fest in the common room.</p>

  <p class="normal">With everybody contributing from their own particular area of the dig, and from their own specialized talents and interests, we built up a series of pictures of our city.</p>

  <p class="normal">Massive red walls, ornamented with the chevron patterns of the waves that made Phoenicia great. Red walls that caught the rays of the setting sun, the evening blessing of the great sun god Baal. The tall towers, symbols of fertility and prosperity, rising from the dark green foliage of the silent grove. Beyond it, the vertical gash in the cliffs that led through a secret passage into the mysterious cavern. Again a symbol of the organs of reproduction. Surely this must have been sacred to Astarte - more commonly worshipped by the Carthaginians as Tanith - goddess of earth and moon, and so ranks of white-clad priests wound in procession through the grove, past the towers and into the secret cavern.</p>

  <p class="normal">We knew that the Phoenicians made human sacrifices to their gods and goddesses. The Old Testament describes the infants delivered to the flaming belly of Baal, and we wondered what dreadful ritual our peaceful emerald pool had seen, depicting the victim dressed in gold and finery and poised on the edge of the pool with the high priest lifting the sacrificial knife.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘If only it weren’t so deep!’ Sally exclaimed. ‘Ben wanted to get divers to go down, but he says they wouldn’t work so deep.’</p>

  <p class="normal">In the area between the inner and outer walls of the temple, where the layer of ash lay thick and where the majority of golden beads and richer ornaments had been discovered, we drew in the quarters of the priests and priestesses. This would be a maze of mud walls with thatched roofs. We reconstructed the streets and courts of the priests and nobles.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘What about the king and his court?’ Peter demanded. ‘Wouldn’t they live within the main walls also?’</p>

  <p class="normal">So we divided the area between the quarters of the priests and the court of the king, drawing on what little we knew of Knossos, Carthage and Tyre and Sidon to give our paintings life. Ral had found the gate through the outer wall, it was the only opening and it looked towards the west.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘From it a road would have led directly down to the harbour.’ Sally drew it in.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Yes, but there would have been a market, a place of trade beside the harbour,’ Ral suggested, and pointed to the map. ‘This would be it. The area Peter has been puzzling over.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Can you imagine the piles of ivory and copper and gold.’ Leslie sighed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the slaves standing on the blocks to be sold,’ Heather agreed.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Hold it! Hold it! This is supposed to be a scientific investigation.’ I tried to restrain them.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘And the ships lying on the beach.’ Sally started to paint them in. ‘Huge biremes with their prows shaped like rams’ heads, covered with gilt and enamel.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The walls and towers rose again, the lake refilled with bright waters, and the harbours and taverns were peopled with hosts dead for two thousand years. Warriors strutted, and slaves whined, noble ladies rode in their litters, caravans poured in from the land to the east laden with gold and treasure, and a white king strode out through the great stone gates with a resetted shield on his shoulder and his armour asparkle in the sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">The project was fun, and it served also to prod our imagination. By the time Sally had put the last touches to our painting, four weeks had passed, and as a direct result of it Peter had discovered the shipyards suggested by Sally’s biremes beached below the city.</p>

  <p class="normal">There was the keel of a ship laid on the slip, with the main frames in place. The unfinished vessel had been burned, and its charred parts scattered. Only imagination and faith could recognise it as a ship. I knew my scientific opponents would challenge it, but carbon 14 on the charred wood gave us an approximate date of AD 300, the date which we had defined as that of the ‘great fire’.</p>

  <p class="normal">The project gave me an excuse to spend more of my time with Sally. I began taking my lunch and bathing costume up to the cavern. At first there was an awkwardness between us, but I worked hard at setting Sally at ease and soon we were back in that friendly bantering relationship that made us such a good working team. Only once I referred back to our more intimate association.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Have you still got the blues, Sal?’ I asked, and she gave me a long frank gaze before replying.</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Please give me time, Ben. There is something I have to work out with myself.’</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Okay.’ I smiled as cheerfully as I could, and resigned myself to a long, long wait.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometimes the others joined our lunchtime sessions at the pool, for even when the heat was a hissing 115° outside, it was cool in the cavern. We splashed and shouted, and the echoes boomed back at us. One of my indelible memories is that of Leslie clad in a frilly little pink bikini romping skittishly around the pool like a lady hippopotamus in the mating season, pursued by the indefatigable Ral.</p>

  <p class="normal">Five weeks after my return I went up to the cavern with good news.</p>
