    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>hree cold days passed. The thermometer never made it up to the zero mark, not even at midday. Shadow wondered how people had survived this weather in the days before electricity, before thermal face masks and lightweight thermal underwear, before easy travel.</p>

    <p class="normal">He was down at the Video, Tanning, Bait, and Tackle store, being shown Hinzelmann’s hand-tied trout flies. They were more interesting than he had expected: colorful fakes of life, made of feather and thread, each with a hook hidden inside it.</p>

    <p class="normal">He asked Hinzelmann.</p>

    <p class="normal">“For real?” asked Hinzelmann.</p>

    <p class="normal">“For real,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well,” said the older man. “Sometimes they didn’t survive it, and they died. Leaky chimneys and badly ventilated stoves and ranges killed as many people as the cold. But those days were hard—they’d spend the summer and the fall laying up the food and the firewood for the winter. The worst thing of all was the madness. I heard on the radio, they were saying how it was to do with the sunlight, how there isn’t enough of it in the winter. My daddy, he said folk just went stir-crazy—winter madness they called it. Lakeside always had it easy, but some of the other towns around here, they had it hard. There was a saying still had currency when I was a kid, that if the serving girl hadn’t tried to kill you by February she hadn’t any backbone.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Storybooks were like gold-dust—anything you could read was treasured, back before the town had a lending library. When my grampaw got sent a storybook from his brother in Bavaria, all the Germans in town <a id="page259"></a>met up in the town hall to hear him read it, and the Finns and the Irish and the rest of them, they’d make the Germans tell them the stories.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Twenty miles south of here, in Jibway, they found a woman walking mother-naked in the winter with a dead babe at her breast, and she’d not suffer them to take it from her.” He shook his head meditatively, closed the fly cabinet with a click. “Bad business. You want a video rental card? Eventually they’ll open a Blockbuster here, and then we’ll soon be out of business. But for now we got a pretty fair selection.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow reminded Hinzelmann that he had no television and no VCR. He enjoyed Hinzelmann’s company—the reminiscences, the tall tales, the goblin grin of the old man. It could make things awkward between them were Shadow to admit that television had made him uncomfortable ever since it had started to talk to him.</p>

    <p class="normal">Hinzelmann fished in a drawer, and took out a tin box—by the look of it, it had once been a Christmas Box, of the kind that contained chocolates or cookies: a mottled Santa Claus, holding a tray of Coca-Cola bottles, beamed up from its lid. Hinzelmann eased off the metal top of the box, revealing a notebook and books of blank tickets, and said, “How many you want me to put you down for?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“How many of what?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Klunker tickets. She’ll go out onto the ice today, so we’ve started selling tickets. Each ticket is ten dollars, five for forty, ten for seventy-five. One ticket buys you five minutes. Of course we can’t promise it’ll go down in your five minutes, but the person who’s closest stands to win five hundred bucks, and if it goes down in your five minutes, you win a thousand dollars. The earlier you buy your tickets, the more times aren’t spoken for. You want to see the info sheet?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sure.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Hinzelmann handed Shadow a photocopied sheet. The klunker was an old car with its engine and fuel tank removed, which would be parked out on the ice for the winter. Sometime in the spring the lake ice would melt, and when it was too thin to bear the car’s weight the car would fall into the lake. The earliest the klunker had ever tumbled into the lake was February the twenty-seventh (“That was the winter of 1998. I don’t think you could rightly call that a winter at all”), the latest was May the first (“That was 1950. Seemed that year that the only way that winter <a id="page260"></a>would end was if somebody hammered a stake through its heart”). The beginning of April appeared to be the most common time for the car to sink—normally in mid-afternoon.</p>

    <p class="normal">All of the mid-afternoons in April had already gone, marked off in Hinzelmann’s lined notebook. Shadow bought a twenty-five-minute period on the morning of March the twenty-third, from 9:00 <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. to 9: 25 <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. He handed Hinzelmann forty dollars.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I just wish everybody in town was as easy a sell as you are,” said Hinzelmann.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s a thank-you for that ride you gave me that first night I was in town.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No, Mike,” said Hinzelmann. “It’s for the children.” For a moment he looked serious, with no trace of impishness on his creased old face. “Come down this afternoon, you can lend a hand pushing the klunker out onto the lake.”</p>

    <p class="normal">He passed Shadow five blue cards, each with a date and time written on it in Hinzelmann’s old-fashioned handwriting, then entered the details of each in his notebook.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Hinzelmann,” asked Shadow. “Have you ever heard of eagle stones?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Up north of Rhinelander? Nope, that’s Eagle River. Can’t say I have.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“How about thunderbirds?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well, there was the Thunderbird Framing Gallery up on Fifth Street, but that closed down. I’m not helping, am I?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Nope.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Tell you what, why don’t you go look at the library. Good people, although they may be kind of distracted by the library sale on this week. I showed you where the library was, didn’t I?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow nodded, and said so long. He wished he’d thought of the library himself. He got into the purple 4Runner and drove south on Main Street, following the lake around to the southernmost point, until he reached the castle-like building which housed the city library. He walked inside. A sign pointed to the basement: <span class="smallCaps">LIBRARY SALE</span>, it said. The library proper was on the ground floor, and he stamped the snow off his boots and went in.</p>

    <p class="normal">A forbidding woman with pursed, crimson-colored lips asked him pointedly if she could help him.</p>

    <a id="page261"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“I suppose I need a library card,” he said. “And I want to know all about thunderbirds.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The woman had him fill out a form, then she told him it would take a week until he could be issued with his card. Shadow wondered if they spent the week sending out inquiries to ensure that he was not wanted in any other libraries across America for failure to return library books.</p>

    <p class="normal">He had known a man in prison who had been imprisoned for stealing library books.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sounds kind of rough,” said Shadow, when the man told him why he was inside.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Half a million dollars’ worth of books,” said the man, proudly. His name was Gary McGuire. “Mostly rare and antique books from libraries and universities. They found a whole storage locker filled with books from floor to ceiling. Open and shut case.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Why did you take them?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I wanted them,” said Gary.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Jesus. Half a million dollars’ worth of books.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Gary flashed him a grin, lowered his voice and said, “That was just in the storage locker they <span class="italic">found</span>. They never found the garage in San Clemente with the <span class="italic">really</span> good stuff in it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Gary had died in prison, when what the infirmary had told him was just a malingering, feeling-lousy kind of day turned out to be a ruptured appendix. Now, here in the Lakeside library, Shadow found himself thinking about a garage in San Clemente with box after box of rare, strange and beautiful books in it rotting away, all of them browning and wilting and being eaten by mold and insects in the darkness, waiting for someone who would never come to set them free.</p>

    <p class="normal">Native American Beliefs and Traditions was on a single shelf in one castle-like turret. Shadow pulled down some books and sat in the window seat. In several minutes he had learned that thunderbirds were mythical gigantic birds who lived on mountaintops, who brought the lightning and who flapped their wings to make the thunder. There were some tribes, he read, who believed that the thunderbirds had made the world. Another half-hour’s reading did not turn up anything more, and he could find no mention of eagle stones anywhere in the books’ indexes.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow was putting the last of the books back on the shelf when he <a id="page262"></a>became aware of somebody staring at him. Someone small and grave was peeking at him from around the heavy shelves. As he turned to look, the face vanished. He turned his back on the boy, then glanced around to see that he was being watched once more.</p>

    <p class="normal">In his pocket was the Liberty dollar. He took it out of his pocket, held it up in his right hand, making sure the boy could see it. He finger-palmed it into his left hand, displayed both hands empty, raised his left hand to his mouth and coughed once, letting the coin tumble from his left hand into his right.</p>

    <p class="normal">The boy looked at him wide-eyed and scampered away, returning a few moments later, dragging an unsmiling Marguerite Olsen, who looked at Shadow suspiciously and said, “Hello, Mister Ainsel. Leon says you were doing magic for him.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Just a little prestidigitation, ma’am.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Please don’t,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m sorry. I was just trying to entertain him.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She shook her head, tautly. <span class="italic">Drop it.</span> Shadow dropped it. He said, “I never did say thank you for your advice about heating the apartment. It’s warm as toast in there right now.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“That’s good.” Her icy expression had not begun to thaw.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s a lovely library,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s a beautiful building. But the city needs something more efficient and less beautiful. You going to the library sale downstairs?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I wasn’t planning on it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well, you should. It’s for a good cause. Makes money for new books, cleans out shelf space, and it’s raising money to put in computers for the children’s section. But the sooner we get a whole new library built, the better.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll make a point of getting down there.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Head out into the hall and then go downstairs. Good seeing you, Mister Ainsel.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Call me Mike,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">She said nothing, just took Leon’s hand and walked the boy over to the children’s section.</p>

    <p class="normal">“But, Mom,” Shadow heard Leon say, “it wasn’t <span class="italic">pressed igitation</span>. It <span class="italic">wasn’t</span>. I <span class="italic">saw</span> it vanish and then it fell out of his <span class="italic">nose</span>. I <span class="italic">saw</span> it.”</p>

    <a id="page263"></a> 

    <p class="normal">An oil portrait of Abraham Lincoln gazed down from the wall at him. Shadow walked down the marble and oak steps to the library basement, through a door into a large room filled with tables, each table covered with books of all kinds, indiscriminately assorted and promiscuously arranged: paperbacks and hardcovers, fiction and non-fiction, periodicals and encyclopedias all side by side upon the tables, spines up or spines out.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow wandered to the back of the room where there was a table covered with old-looking leather-bound books, each with a library catalog number painted in white on the spine. “You’re the first person over in that corner all day,” said the man sitting by the stack of empty boxes and bags and the small, open, metal cashbox. “Mostly folk just take the thrillers and the children’s books and the Harlequin Romances. Jenny Kerton, Danielle Steel, all that.” The man was reading Agatha Christie’s <span class="italic">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.</span> “Everything on the tables is fifty cents a book, or you can take three for a dollar.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow thanked him and continued to browse. He found a copy of Herodotus’s <span class="italic">Histories</span> bound in peeling brown leather. It made him think of the paperback copy he had left behind in prison. There was a book called <span class="italic">Perplexing Parlour Illusions,</span> which looked like it might have some coin effects. He carried both the books over to the man with the cashbox.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Buy one more, it’s still a dollar,” said the man. “And if you take another book away, you’ll be doing us a favor. We need the shelf-space.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow walked back to the old leather-bound books. He decided to liberate the book that was least likely to be bought by anyone else, and found himself unable to decide between <span class="italic">Common Diseases of the Urinary Tract with Illustrations by a Medical Doctor</span> and <span class="italic">Minutes of the Lakeside City Council 1872–1884</span>. He looked at the illustrations in the medical book and decided that somewhere in the town there was a teenage boy who could use the book to gross out his friends. He took the <span class="italic">Minutes</span> to the man on the door, who took his dollar and put all the books into a Dave’s Finest Food brown paper sack.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow left the library. He had a clear view of the lake, all the way to the northeastern corner. He could even see his apartment building, a small brown box on the bank up past the bridge. And there were men on the ice near the bridge, four or five of them, pushing a dark green car into the center of the white lake.</p>

    <a id="page264"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“March the twenty-third,” Shadow said to the lake, under his breath. “Nine <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. to nine twenty-five <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>.” He wondered if the lake or the klunker could hear him—and if they would pay any attention to him, even if they could. He doubted it. In Shadow’s world, luck, the good kind, was something that other people had, not him.</p>

    <p class="normal">The wind blew bitter against his face.</p>

    <p class="normal">Officer Chad Mulligan was waiting outside Shadow’s apartment when he got back. Shadow’s heart began to pound when he saw the police car, to relax a little when he observed that the policeman was doing paperwork in the front seat.</p>

    <p class="normal">He walked over to the car, carrying his paper sack of books.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mulligan lowered his window. “Library sale?” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I bought a box of Robert Ludlum books there two, three years back. Keep meaning to read them. My cousin swears by the guy. These days I figure if I ever get marooned on a desert island and I got my box of Robert Ludlum books with me, I can catch up on my reading.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Something particular I can do for you, Chief?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Not a damn thing, pal. Thought I’d stop by and see how you were settling in. You remember that Chinese saying, ‘You save a man’s life, you’re responsible for him’? Well, I’m not saying I saved your life last week. But I still thought I should check in. How’s the Gunther Purple-mobile doing?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Good,” said Shadow. “It’s good. Running fine.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Pleased to hear it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I saw my next-door neighbor in the library,” said Shadow. “Miz Olsen. I was wondering…”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What crawled up her butt and died?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“If you want to put it like that.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Long story. You want to ride along for a spell, and I’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow thought about it for a moment. “Okay,” he said. He got into the car, sat in the front passenger seat. Mulligan drove north of town. Then he turned off his lights and parked beside the road.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Darren Olsen met Marge at UW Stevens Point and he brought her back north to Lakeside. She was a journalism major. He was studying, <a id="page265"></a>shit, hotel management, something like that. When they got here, jaws dropped. This was, what, thirteen, fourteen years ago. She was so beautiful…that black hair…” He paused. “Darren managed the Motel America over in Camden, twenty miles west of here. Except nobody ever seemed to want to stop in Camden and eventually the motel closed. They had two boys. At that time Sandy was eleven. The little one—Leon is it?—was just a babe in arms.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Darren Olsen wasn’t a brave man. He’d been a good high school football player, but that was the last time he was flying high. Whatever. He couldn’t find the courage to tell Margie that he’d lost his job. So for a month, maybe for two months, he’d drive off early in the morning, come home late in the evening complaining about the hard day he’d had at the motel.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What was he doing?” asked Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Mm. Couldn’t say for certain. I reckon he was driving up to Ironwood, maybe down to Green Bay. Guess he started out as a job hunter. Pretty soon he was drinking the time away, getting stoned, more than probably meeting the occasional working girl for a little instant gratification. He could have been gambling. What I do know for certain is that he emptied out their joint account in about ten weeks. It was only a matter of time before Margie figured out—there we go!”</p>

    <p class="normal">He swung the car out, flicked on the siren and the lights, and scared the daylights out of a small man with Iowa plates who had just come down the hill at seventy.</p>

    <p class="normal">The rogue Iowan ticketed, Mulligan returned to his story.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Where was I? Okay. So Margie kicks him out, sues for divorce. It turned into a vicious custody battle. That’s what they call ’em when they get into <span class="italic">People</span> magazine. Vicious Custody Battle. Always makes me think of lawyers with knives and assault weapons and brass knuckles. She got the kids. Darren got visitation rights and precious little else. Now, back then Leon was pretty small. Sandy was older, a good kid, the kind of boy who worships his daddy. Wouldn’t let Margie say nothing bad about him. They lost the house—had a nice place down on Daniels Road. She moved into the apartments. He left town. Came back every few months to make everybody miserable.</p>

    <p class="normal">“This went on for a few years. He’d come back, spend money on the <a id="page266"></a>kids, leave Margie in tears. Most of us just started wishing he’d never come back at all. His mom and pop had moved to Florida when they retired, said they couldn’t take another Wisconsin winter. So last year he came out, said he wanted to take the boys to Florida for Christmas. Margie said not a hope, told him to get lost. It got pretty unpleasant—at one point I had to go over there. Domestic dispute. By the time I got there Darren was standing in the front yard shouting stuff, the boys were barely holding it together, Margie was crying.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I told Darren he was shaping up for a night in the cells. I thought for a moment he was going to hit me, but he was sober enough not to do that. I gave him a ride down to the trailer park south of town, told him to shape up. That he’d hurt her enough…Next day he left town.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Two weeks later, Sandy vanished. Didn’t get onto the school bus. Told his best friend that he’d be seeing his dad soon, that Darren was bringing him a specially cool present to make up for having missed Christmas in Florida. Nobody’s seen him since. Non-custodial kidnappings are the hardest. It’s tough to find a kid who doesn’t want to be found, y’see?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said that he did. He saw something else as well. Chad Mulligan was in love with Marguerite Olsen himself. He wondered if the man knew how obvious it was.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mulligan pulled out once more, lights flashing, and pulled over some teenagers doing sixty. He didn’t ticket them, “just put the fear of God in them.”</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>hat evening Shadow sat at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to transform a silver dollar into a penny. It was a trick he had found in <span class="italic">Perplexing Parlour Illusions</span> but the instructions were infuriating, unhelpful, and vague. Phrases like “then vanish the penny in the usual way” occurred every sentence or so. In this context, Shadow wondered, what was “the usual way”? A French drop? Sleeving it? Shouting “Oh my god, look out—a mountain lion!” and dropping the coin into his side pocket while the audience’s attention was diverted?</p>

    <p class="normal">He tossed his silver dollar into the air, caught it, remembering the moon and the woman who gave it to him, then he attempted the illusion. It didn’t seem to work. He walked into the bathroom and tried it in front <a id="page267"></a>of the mirror, and confirmed that he was right. The trick as written simply didn’t work. He sighed, dropped the coins in his pocket and sat down on the couch. He spread the cheap throw rug over his legs and flipped open the <span class="italic">Minutes of the Lakeside Council 1872–1884</span>. The type, in two columns, was so small as to be almost unreadable. He flipped through the book, looking at the reproductions of the photographs of the period, at the several incarnations of the Lakeside city council therein: long side-whiskers and clay pipes and battered hats and shiny hats, worn with faces which were, many of them, peculiarly familiar. He was unsurprised to see that the portly secretary of the 1882 city council was a Patrick Mulligan: shave him, make him lose twenty pounds and he’d be a dead ringer for Chad Mulligan, his—what, great-great-grandson? He wondered if Hinzelmann’s pioneer grandfather was in the photographs, but it did not appear that he had been city council material. Shadow thought he had seen a reference to a Hinzelmann in the text, while flipping from photograph to photograph, but it eluded him when he leafed back for it, and the tiny type made Shadow’s eyes ache.</p>

    <p class="normal">He put the book down on his chest and realized his head was nodding. It would be foolish to fall asleep on the couch, he decided, soberly. The bedroom was only a few feet away. On the other hand, the bedroom and the bed would still be there in five minutes, and anyway, he was not going to go to sleep, only to close his eyes for a moment…</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Darkness roared.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He stood on an open plain. Beside him was the place from which he had once emerged, from which the earth had squeezed him. Stars were still falling from the sky and each star that touched the red earth became a man or a woman. The men had long black hair and high cheekbones. The women all looked like Marguerite Olsen. These were the star people.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">They looked at him with dark, proud eyes.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“Tell me about the thunderbirds,” said Shadow. “Please. It’s not for me. It’s for my wife.”</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">One by one they turned their backs on him, and as he lost their faces they were gone, one with the landscape. But the last of them, her hair streaked white on dark gray, pointed before she turned away, pointed into the wine-colored sky.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">“Ask them yourself,” she said. Summer lightning flickered, momentarily illuminating the landscape from horizon to horizon.</span></p>

    <a id="page268"></a> 

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">There were high rocks near him, peaks and spires of sandstone, and Shadow began to climb the nearest. The spire was the color of old ivory. He grabbed at a handhold, and felt it slice into his hand.</span> It’s bone, <span class="italic">thought Shadow.</span> Not stone. It’s old dry bone.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">But it was a dream, and in dreams, sometimes, you have no choices: either there are no decisions to be made, or they were made for you long before ever the dream began. Shadow continued to climb, pulling himself up. His hands hurt. Bone popped and crushed and fragmented under his bare feet, cutting them painfully. The wind tugged at him, and he pressed himself to the spire, and he continued to climb the tower.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">It was made of only one kind of bone, he realized, repeated over and over. Each of the bones was dry and ball-like. For a moment he had imagined they might be old yellow shells or the eggs of some dreadful bird. But another flare of lightning told him differently: they had holes for eyes, and they had teeth, which grinned without humor.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Somewhere birds were calling. Rain spattered his face.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He was hundreds of feet above the ground, clinging to the side of the tower of skulls, while flashes of lightning burned in the wings of the shadowy birds who circled the spire—enormous black, condor-like birds, each with a ruff of white at its neck. They were huge, graceful, awful birds, and the beats of their wings crashed like thunder on the night air.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">They were circling the spire.</span></p>

    <p class="normal">They must be fifteen, twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip, <span class="italic">thought Shadow.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Then the first bird swung out of its glide toward him, blue lightning crackling in its wings. He pushed himself into a crevice of skulls, hollow eye-holes stared at him, a clutter of ivory teeth smiled at him, but he kept climbing, pulling himself up the mountain of skulls, every sharp edge cutting into his skin, feeling revulsion and terror and awe.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">Another bird came at him, and one hand-sized talon sank into his arm.</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He reached out and tried to grasp a feather from its wing. If he returned to his tribe without a thunderbird’s feather he would be disgraced, he would never be a man, but the bird pulled up, so that he could not grasp even one feather. The thunderbird loosened its grip and swung back onto the wind. Shadow continued to climb.</span></p>

    <p class="normal">There must be a thousand skulls, <span class="italic">thought Shadow.</span> A thousand thousand. And not all of them are human. <span class="italic">He stood at last on the top of the spire, the great birds, the thunderbirds, circling him slowly, navigating the gusts of the storm with tiny flicks of their wings.</span></p>

    <a id="page269"></a> 

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He heard a voice, the voice of the buffalo man, calling to him on the wind, telling him who the skulls belonged to…</span></p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">The tower began to tumble, and the biggest bird, its eyes the blinding blue-white of forked lightning, plummeted down toward him in a rush of thunder, and Shadow was falling, tumbling down the tower of skulls…</span></p>

    <p class="normal">The telephone shrilled. Shadow had not even known that it was connected. Groggy, shaken, he picked it up.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What the fuck,” shouted Wednesday, angrier than Shadow had ever heard him. “What the almighty flying fuck do you think you are playing at?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I was asleep,” said Shadow into the receiver, stupidly.</p>

    <p class="normal">“What do you think is the fucking point of stashing you in a hiding place like Lakeside, if you’re going to raise such a ruckus that not even a dead man could miss it?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I dreamed of thunderbirds…,” said Shadow. “And a tower. Skulls…” It seemed to him very important to recount his dream.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I know what you were dreaming. Everybody damn well knows what you were dreaming. Christ almighty. What’s the point in hiding you, if you’re going to start to fucking advertise?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said nothing.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a pause at the other end of the telephone. “I’ll be there in the morning,” said Wednesday. It sounded like the anger had died down. “We’re going to San Francisco. The flowers in your hair are optional.” And the line went dead.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow put the telephone down on the carpet, and sat up, stiffly. It was six <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. and still night-dark outside. He got up from the sofa, shivering. He could hear the wind as it screamed across the frozen lake. And he could hear somebody nearby, crying, only the thickness of a wall away. He was certain it was Marguerite Olsen, and her sobbing was insistent and low and heartbreaking.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow walked into the bathroom and pissed, then went into his bedroom and closed the door, blocking off the sound of the crying woman. Outside the wind howled and wailed as if it, too, was seeking for a lost child, and he slept no more that night.</p>

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <a id="page270"></a> 

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">S</span></span>an Francisco in January was unseasonably warm, warm enough that the sweat prickled on the back of Shadow’s neck. Wednesday was wearing a deep blue suit, and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles that made him look like an entertainment lawyer.</p>

    <p class="normal">They were walking along Haight Street. The street people and the hustlers and the moochers watched them go by, and no one shook a paper cup of change at them, no one asked them for anything at all.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday’s jaw was set. Shadow had seen immediately that the man was still angry, and had asked no questions when the black Lincoln town car had pulled up outside the apartment that morning. They had not talked on the way to the airport. He had been relieved that Wednesday was in first class and he was back in coach.</p>

    <p class="normal">Now it was late in the afternoon. Shadow, who had not been in San Francisco since he was a boy, who had only seen it since then as a background to movies, was astonished at how familiar it was, how colorful and unique the wooden houses, how steep the hills, how very much it didn’t feel like anywhere else.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It’s almost hard to believe that this is in the same country as Lakeside,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday glared at him. Then he said, “It’s not. San Francisco isn’t in the same country as Lakeside any more than New Orleans is in the same country as New York or Miami is in the same country as Minneapolis.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Is that so?” said Shadow, mildly.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Indeed it is. They may share certain cultural signifiers—money, a federal government, entertainment; it’s the same <span class="italic">land,</span> obviously—but the only things that give it the illusion of being one country are the green-back, <span class="italic">The Tonight Show,</span> and McDonald’s.” They were approaching a park at the end of the road. “Be nice to the lady we are visiting. But not too nice.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ll be cool,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">They stepped onto the grass.</p>

    <p class="normal">A young girl, no older than fourteen, her hair dyed green and orange and pink, stared at them as they went by. She sat beside a dog, a mongrel, with a piece of string for a collar and a leash. She looked hungrier than the dog did. The dog yapped at them, then wagged its tail.</p>

    <a id="page271"></a> 

    <p class="normal">Shadow gave the girl a dollar bill. She stared at it as if she was not sure what it was. “Buy dog food with it,” Shadow suggested. She nodded, and smiled.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Let me put it bluntly,” said Wednesday. “You must be very cautious around the lady we are visiting. She might take a fancy to you, and that would be bad.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Is she your girlfriend or something?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Not for all the little plastic toys in China,” said Wednesday, agreeably. His anger seemed to have dissipated, or perhaps to have been invested for the future. Shadow suspected that anger was the engine that made Wednesday run.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a woman sitting on the grass, under a tree, with a paper tablecloth spread in front of her, and a variety of Tupperware dishes on the cloth.</p>

    <p class="normal">She was—not fat, no, far from fat: what she was, a word that Shadow had never had cause to use until now, was <span class="italic">curvaceous</span>. Her hair was so fair that it was white, the kind of platinum-blonde tresses that should have belonged to a long-dead movie starlet, her lips were painted crimson, and she looked to be somewhere between twenty-five and fifty.</p>

    <p class="normal">As they reached her she was selecting from a plate of deviled eggs. She looked up as Wednesday approached her, and put down the egg she had chosen, and wiped her hand. “Hello, you old fraud,” she said, but she smiled as she said it, and Wednesday bowed low, took her hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

    <p class="normal">He said, “You look divine.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“How the hell else should I look?” she demanded, sweetly. “Anyway, you’re a liar. New Orleans was <span class="italic">such</span> a mistake—I put on, what, thirty pounds there? I swear. I knew I had to leave when I started to waddle. The tops of my thighs rub together when I walk now, can you believe that?” This last was addressed to Shadow. He had no idea what to say in reply, and felt a hot flush suffuse his face. The woman laughed delightedly. “He’s <span class="italic">blushing</span>! Wednesday my sweet, you brought me a <span class="italic">blusher</span>. How perfectly wonderful of you. What’s he called?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“This is Shadow,” said Wednesday. He seemed to be enjoying Shadow’s discomfort. “Shadow, say hello to Easter.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow said something that might have been Hello, and the woman <a id="page272"></a>smiled at him again. He felt like he was caught in headlights—the blinding kind that poachers use to freeze deer before they shoot them. He could smell her perfume from where he was standing, an intoxicating mixture of jasmine and honeysuckle, of sweet milk and female skin.</p>

    <p class="normal">“So, how’s tricks?” asked Wednesday.</p>

    <p class="normal">The woman—Easter—laughed a deep and throaty laugh, full-bodied and joyous. How could you not like someone who laughed like that? “Everything’s fine,” she said. “How about you, you old wolf?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I was hoping to enlist your assistance.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Wasting your time.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“At least hear me out before dismissing me.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No point. Don’t even bother.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She looked at Shadow. “Please, sit down here and help yourself to some of this food. Here, take a plate and pile it high. It’s all good. Eggs, roast chicken, chicken curry, chicken salad, and over here is lapin—rabbit, actually, but cold rabbit is a delight, and in that bowl over there is the jugged hare, well, why don’t I just fill a plate for you?” And she did, taking a plastic plate and piling it high with foods and passing it to him. Then she looked at Wednesday. “Are you eating?” she asked.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I am at your disposal, my dear,” said Wednesday.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You,” she told him, “are so full of shit it’s a wonder your eyes don’t turn brown.” She passed him an empty plate. “Help yourself,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">The afternoon sun at her back burned her hair into a platinum aura. “Shadow,” she said, chewing a chicken leg with gusto. “That’s a sweet name. Why do they call you Shadow?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow licked his lips to moisten them. “When I was a kid,” he said. “We lived, my mother and I, we were, I mean, she was, well, like a secretary, at a bunch of U.S. embassies, we went from city to city all over Northern Europe. Then she got sick and had to take early retirement and we came back to the States. I never knew what to say to the other kids, so I’d just find adults and follow them around, not saying anything. I just needed the company, I guess. I don’t know. I was a small kid.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You grew,” she said.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Shadow. “I grew.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She turned back to Wednesday, who was spooning down a bowl of what looked like cold gumbo. “Is this the boy who’s got everybody so upset?”</p>

    <a id="page273"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“You heard?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I keep my ears pricked up,” she said. Then to Shadow, “You keep out of their way. There are too many secret societies out there, and they have no loyalties and no love. Commercial, independent, government, they’re all in the same boat. They range from the barely competent to the deeply dangerous. Hey, old wolf, I heard a joke you’d like the other day. How do you know the CIA wasn’t involved in the Kennedy assassination?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’ve heard it,” said Wednesday.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Pity.” She turned her attention back to Shadow. “But the spookshow, the ones you met, they’re something else. They exist because everyone knows they must exist.” She drained a paper cup of something that looked like white wine, and then she got to her feet. “Shadow’s a good name,” she said. “I want a mochaccino. Come on.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She began to walk away. “What about the food?” asked Wednesday. “You can’t just leave it here.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She smiled at him, and pointed to the girl sitting by the dog, and then extended her arms to take in the Haight and the world. “Let it feed them,” she said, and she walked, with Wednesday and Shadow trailing behind her.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Remember,” she said to Wednesday, as they walked, “<span class="italic">I’m</span> rich. I’m doing just peachy. Why should I help you?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re one of us,” he said. “You’re as forgotten and as unloved and unremembered as any of us. It’s pretty clear whose side you should be on.”</p>

    <p class="normal">They reached a sidewalk coffeehouse, went inside. There was only one waitress, who wore her eyebrow ring as a mark of caste, and a woman making coffee behind the counter. The waitress advanced upon them, smiling automatically, sat them down, took their orders.</p>

    <p class="normal">Easter put her slim hand on the back of Wednesday’s square gray hand. “I’m telling you,” she said, “I’m doing <span class="italic">fine</span>. On my festival days they still feast on eggs and rabbits, on candy and on flesh, to represent rebirth and copulation. They wear flowers in their bonnets and they give each other flowers. They do it in my name. More and more of them every year. In <span class="italic">my</span> name, old wolf.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And you wax fat and affluent on their worship and their love?” he said, dryly.</p>

    <a id="page274"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Don’t be an asshole.” Suddenly she sounded very tired. She sipped her mochaccino.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Serious question, m’dear. Certainly I would agree that millions upon millions of them give each other tokens in your name, and that they still practice all the rites of your festival, even down to hunting for hidden eggs. But how many of them know who you are? Eh? Excuse me, miss?” This to their waitress.</p>

    <p class="normal">She said, “You need another espresso?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No, my dear. I was just wondering if you could solve a little argument we were having over here. My friend and I were disagreeing over what the word ‘Easter’ means. Would you happen to know?”</p>

    <p class="normal">The girl stared at him as if green toads had begun to push their way between his lips. Then she said, “I don’t know about any of that Christian stuff. I’m a pagan.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The woman behind the counter said, “I think it’s like Latin or something for ‘Christ has risen’ maybe.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Really?” said Wednesday.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yeah, sure,” said the woman. “Easter. Just like the sun rises in the east, you know.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“The risen son. Of course—a most logical supposition.” The woman smiled and returned to her coffee grinder. Wednesday looked up at their waitress. “I think I <span class="italic">shall</span> have another espresso, if you do not mind. And tell me, as a pagan, who do <span class="italic">you</span> worship?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Worship?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“That’s right. I imagine you must have a pretty wide-open field. So to whom do you set up your household altar? To whom do you bow down? To whom do you pray at dawn and at dusk?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Her lips described several shapes without saying anything before she said, “The female principle. It’s an empowerment thing. You know.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Indeed. And this female principle of yours. Does she have a name?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“She’s the goddess within us all,” said the girl with the eyebrow ring, color rising to her cheek. “She doesn’t need a name.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Ah,” said Wednesday, with a wide monkey grin, “so do you have mighty bacchanals in her honor? Do you drink blood wine under the full moon, while scarlet candles burn in silver candleholders? Do you step naked into the sea-foam, chanting ecstatically to your nameless goddess <a id="page275"></a>while the waves lick at your legs, lapping your thighs like the tongues of a thousand leopards?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re making fun of me,” she said. “We don’t do any of that stuff you were saying.” She took a deep breath. Shadow suspected she was counting to ten. “Any more coffees here? Another mochaccino for you, ma’am?” Her smile was a lot like the one she had greeted them with when they had entered.</p>

    <p class="normal">They shook their heads, and the waitress turned to greet another customer.</p>

    <p class="normal">“There,” said Wednesday, “is one who ‘does not have the faith and will not have the fun.’ Chesterton. Pagan indeed. So. Shall we go out onto the street, Easter my dear, and repeat the exercise? Find out how many passers-by know that their Easter festival takes its name from Eostre of the Dawn? Let’s see—I have it. We shall ask a hundred people. For every one that knows the truth, you may cut off one of my fingers, and when I run out of them, toes; for every twenty who don’t know you spend a night making love to me. And the odds are certainly in your favor here—this is San Francisco, after all. There are heathens and pagans and Wiccans aplenty on these precipitous streets.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Her green eyes looked at Wednesday. They were, Shadow decided, the exact same color as a leaf in spring with the sun shining through it. She said nothing.</p>

    <p class="normal">“We <span class="italic">could</span> try it,” continued Wednesday. “But I would end up with ten fingers, ten toes, and five nights in your bed. So don’t tell me they worship you and keep your festival day. They mouth your name, but it has no meaning to them. Nothing at all.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Tears stood out in her eyes. “I know that,” she said, quietly. “I’m not a fool.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Wednesday. “You’re not.”</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">He’s pushed her too far,</span> thought Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday looked down, ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said. Shadow could hear the real sincerity in his voice. “We <span class="italic">need</span> you. We need your energy. We need your power. Will you fight beside us when the storm comes?”</p>

    <p class="normal">She hesitated. She had a chain of blue forget-me-nots tattooed around her left wrist.</p>

    <a id="page276"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” she said, after a while. “I guess I will.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday kissed his finger, touched it to her cheek. Then he called their waitress over and paid for their coffees, counting out the money carefully, folding it over with the check and presenting it to her.</p>

    <p class="normal">As she walked away, Shadow said, “Ma’am? Excuse me? I think you dropped this.” He picked up a ten-dollar bill from the floor.</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” she said, looking at the wrapped bills in her hand.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I saw it fall, ma’am,” said Shadow, politely. “You should count them.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She counted the money in her hand, looked puzzled and said, “Jesus. You’re right. I’m sorry.” She took the ten-dollar bill from Shadow, and walked away.</p>

    <p class="normal">Easter walked out onto the sidewalk with them. The light was just starting to fade. She nodded to Wednesday, then she touched Shadow’s hand and said, “What did you dream about, last night?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Thunderbirds,” he said. “A mountain of skulls.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She nodded. “And do you know whose skulls they were?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“There was a voice,” he said. “In my dream. It told me.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She nodded and waited.</p>

    <p class="normal">He said, “It said they were mine. Old skulls of mine. Thousands and thousands of them.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She looked at Wednesday, and said, “I think this one’s a keeper.” She smiled her bright smile. Then she patted Shadow’s arm and walked away down the sidewalk. He watched her go, trying—and failing—not to think of her thighs rubbing together as she walked.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the taxi on the way to the airport, Wednesday turned to Shadow. “What the hell was that business with the ten dollars about?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You shortchanged her. It comes out of her wages if she’s short.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“What the hell do you care?” Wednesday seemed genuinely irate.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow thought for a moment. Then he said, “Well, I wouldn’t want anyone to do it to me. She hadn’t done anything wrong.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No?” Wednesday stared off into the middle-distance, and said, “When she was seven years old she shut a kitten in a closet. She listened to it mew for several days. When it ceased to mew, she took it out of the closet, put it into a shoebox, and buried it in the back yard. She wanted to bury something. She consistently steals from everywhere she works. <a id="page277"></a>Small amounts, usually. Last year she visited her grandmother in the nursing home to which the old woman is confined. She took an antique gold watch from her grandmother’s bedside table, and then went prowling through several of the other rooms, stealing small quantities of money and personal effects from the twilight folk in their golden years. When she got home she did not know what to do with her spoils, scared someone would come after her, so she threw everything away except the cash.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I get the idea,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“She also has asymptomatic gonorrhea,” said Wednesday. “She suspects she might be infected but does nothing about it. When her last boyfriend accused her of having given him a disease she was hurt, offended, and refused to see him again.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“This isn’t necessary,” said Shadow. “I said I get the idea. You could do this to anyone, couldn’t you? Tell me bad things about them.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Of course,” agreed Wednesday. “They all do the same things. They may think their sins are original, but for the most part they are petty and repetitive.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And that makes it okay for you to steal ten bucks from her?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Wednesday paid the taxi and the two men walked into the airport, wandered up to their gate. Boarding had not yet begun. Wednesday said, “What the hell <span class="italic">else</span> can I do? They don’t sacrifice rams or bulls to me. They don’t send me the souls of killers and slaves, gallows-hung and raven-picked. <span class="italic">They</span> made me. <span class="italic">They</span> forgot me. Now I take a little back from them. Isn’t that fair?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“My mom used to say, ‘Life isn’t fair,’” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Of course she did,” said Wednesday. “It’s one of those things that moms say, right up there with ‘If all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?’”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You stiffed that girl for ten bucks, I slipped her ten bucks,” said Shadow, doggedly. “It was the right thing to do, and I did it.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Someone announced that their plane was boarding. Wednesday stood up. “May your choices always be so clear,” he said, and once again, he sounded totally sincere.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">It’s true what they say,</span> thought Shadow. <span class="italic">If you can fake sincerity, you’ve got it made.</span></p>

    <a id="page278"></a> 

    <p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

    <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he cold snap was easing when Wednesday dropped Shadow off, in the small hours of the morning. It was still obscenely cold in Lakeside, but it was no longer impossibly cold. The lighted sign on the side of the M&amp;I Bank flashed alternately 3:30 <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. and -5° <span class="smallCaps">F</span> as they drove through the town.</p>

    <p class="normal">It was 9:30 <span class="smallCaps">A.M</span>. when Chief of Police Chad Mulligan knocked on the apartment door and asked Shadow if he knew a girl named Alison McGovern.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I don’t think so,” said Shadow, sleepily.</p>

    <p class="normal">“This is her picture,” said Mulligan. It was a high school photograph. Shadow recognized the person in the picture immediately: the girl with the blue rubber-band braces on her teeth, the one who had been learning all about the oral uses of Alka-Seltzer from her friend.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Oh yeah. Okay. She was on the bus when I came into town.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Where were you yesterday, Mister Ainsel?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow felt his world begin to spin away from him. He knew he had nothing to feel guilty about (<span class="italic">You’re a parole-violating felon living under an assumed name,</span> whispered a calm voice in his mind. <span class="italic">Isn’t that enough</span>?).</p>

    <p class="normal">“San Francisco,” he said. “California. Helping my uncle transport a four-poster bed.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You got any way of proving it? Ticket stubs? Anything like that?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Sure.” He had both his boarding pass stubs in his back pocket, pulled them out. “What’s going on?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Chad Mulligan examined the boarding passes. “Alison McGovern’s vanished. She helped out up at the Lakeside Humane Society. Feed animals, walk dogs. She’d come out for a few hours after school. One of those animal kids. So. Dolly Knopf, who runs the Humane Society, she’d always run her home when they closed up for the night. Yesterday Alison never got there.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“She’s vanished.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yup. Her parents called us last night. Silly kid used to hitchhike up to the Humane Society. It’s out on County W, pretty isolated. Her parents told her not to, but this isn’t the kind of place where things happen…<a id="page279"></a>people here don’t lock their doors, you know? And you can’t tell kids. So, look at the photo again.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Alison McGovern was smiling. The rubber bands on her teeth in the photograph were red, not blue.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You can honestly say you didn’t kidnap her, rape her, murder her, anything like that?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I was in San Francisco. And I wouldn’t do that shit.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“That was what I figured, pal. So you want to come help us look for her?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Me?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You. We’ve had the K-9 guys out this morning—nothing so far.” He sighed. “Heck, Mike. I just hope she turns up in the Twin Cities with some dopey boyfriend.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You think it’s likely?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I think it’s possible. You want to join the hunting party?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow remembered seeing the girl in Henning’s Farm and Home Supplies, the flash of a shy blue-braced smile, how beautiful he had known she was going to be one day. “I’ll come,” he said.</p>

    <p class="normal">There were two dozen men and women waiting in the lobby of the fire station. Shadow recognized Hinzelmann, and several other faces looked familiar. There were several police officers, dressed in blue, and some men and women from the Lumber County sheriff’s department, dressed in brown.</p>

    <p class="normal">Chad Mulligan told them what Alison was wearing when she vanished (a scarlet snowsuit, green gloves, blue woolen hat under the hood of her snowsuit) and divided the volunteers into groups of three. Shadow, Hinzelmann, and a man named Brogan comprised one of the groups. They were reminded how short the daylight period was, told that if, god forbid, they found Alison’s body they were not repeat not to disturb anything, just to radio back for help, but that if she was alive they were to keep her warm until help came.</p>

    <p class="normal">They were dropped off out on County W.</p>

    <p class="normal">Hinzelmann, Brogan and Shadow walked along the edge of a frozen creek. Each group of three had been issued a small hand-held walkie-talkie before they left.</p>

    <a id="page280"></a> 

    <p class="normal">The cloud cover was low, and the world was gray. No snow had fallen in the last thirty-six hours. Footprints stood out in the glittering crust of the crisp snow.</p>

    <p class="normal">Brogan looked like a retired army colonel, with his slim moustache and white temples. He drove them, told Shadow he was a retired high school principal. “I took early retirement when I saw I wasn’t getting any younger. These days I still teach a little, do the school play—that was always the high point of the year anyhow—and now I hunt a little and have a cabin down on Pike Lake, spend too much time there.” As they set out Brogan said, “On the one hand, I hope we find her. On the other, if she’s going to be found, I’d be very grateful if it was someone else who got to find her, and not us. You know what I mean?”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow knew exactly what he meant.</p>

    <p class="normal">The three men did not talk much. They walked, looking for a red snowsuit, or green gloves, or a blue hat, or a white body. Now and again Brogan, who had the walkie-talkie, would check in with Chad Mulligan.</p>

    <p class="normal">At lunchtime they sat with the rest of the search party on a commandeered school bus and ate hot dogs and drank hot soup. Someone pointed out a red-tailed hawk in a bare tree, and someone else said that it looked more like a falcon, but it flew away and the argument was abandoned.</p>

    <p class="normal">Hinzelmann told them a story about his grandfather’s trumpet, and how he tried playing it during a cold snap, and the weather was so cold outside by the barn, where his grandfather had gone to practice, that no music came out.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Then after he came inside he put the trumpet down by the wood-stove to thaw. Well, the family’re all in bed that night and suddenly the unfrozen tunes start coming out of that trumpet. Scared my grandmother so much she nearly had kittens.”</p>

    <p class="normal">The afternoon was endless, unfruitful, and depressing. The daylight faded slowly: distances collapsed and the world turned indigo and the wind blew cold enough to burn the skin on your face. When it was too dark to continue, Mulligan radioed to them to call it off for the evening, and they were picked up and driven back to the fire station.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the block next to the fire station was the Buck Stops Here Tavern, and that was where most of the searchers wound up. They were exhausted and dispirited, talking to each other of the bald eagle that <a id="page281"></a>had circled them, how cold it had become, how more than likely Alison would show up in a day or so, no idea of how much trouble she’d caused everyone.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You shouldn’t think badly of the town because of this,” said Brogan. “It <span class="italic">is</span> a good town.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Lakeside,” said a trim woman whose name Shadow had forgotten, if ever they’d been introduced, “is the best town in the Northwoods. You know how many people are unemployed in Lakeside?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“No,” said Shadow.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Less than twenty,” she said. “There’s over five thousand people live in and around this town. We may not be rich, but everyone’s working. It’s not like the mining towns up in the northeast—most of them are ghost towns now. There were farming towns that were killed by the falling cost of milk, or the low price of hogs. You know what the biggest cause of unnatural death is among farmers in the Midwest?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Suicide?” Shadow hazarded.</p>

    <p class="normal">She looked almost disappointed. “Yeah. That’s it. They kill themselves.” She shook her head. Then she continued, “There are too many towns hereabouts that only exist for the hunters and the vacationers, towns that just take their money and send them home with their trophies and their bug bites. Then there are the company towns, where everything’s just hunky-dory until Wal-Mart relocates their distribution center or 3M stops manufacturing CD cases there or whatever and suddenly there’s a boatload of folks who can’t pay their mortgages. I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Ainsel,” said Shadow. “Mike Ainsel.” The beer he was drinking was a local brew, made with spring water. It was good.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m Callie Knopf,” she said. “Dolly’s sister.” Her face was still ruddy from the cold. “So what I’m saying is that Lakeside’s lucky. We’ve got a little of everything here—farm, light industry, tourism, crafts. Good schools.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow looked at her in puzzlement. There was something empty at the bottom of all her words. It was as if he were listening to a salesman, a good salesman, who believed in his product, but still wanted to make sure you went home with all the brushes or the full set of encyclopedias. Perhaps she could see it in his face. She said, “I’m sorry. When you love <a id="page282"></a>something you just don’t want to stop talking about it. What do you do, Mister Ainsel?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Heavy lifting,” said Shadow. “My uncle buys and sells antiques all over the country. He uses me to move big, heavy things. Without breaking them too badly. It’s a good job, but not steady work.” A black cat, the bar mascot, wound between Shadow’s legs, rubbing its forehead on his boot. It leapt up beside him onto the bench and went to sleep.</p>

    <p class="normal">“At least you get to travel,” said Brogan. “You do anything else?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“You got eight quarters on you?” asked Shadow. Brogan fumbled for his change. He found five quarters, pushed them across the table to Shadow. Callie Knopf produced another three quarters.</p>

    <p class="normal">He laid out the coins, four in each row. Then, with scarcely a fumble, he did the Coins Through the Table, appearing to drop half the coins through the wood of the table, from his left hand into his right.</p>

    <p class="normal">After that, he took all eight coins in his right hand, an empty water glass in his left, covered the glass with a napkin and appeared to make the coins vanish one by one from his right hand and land in the glass beneath the napkin with an audible clink. Finally, he opened his right hand to show it was empty, then swept the napkin away to show the coins in the glass.</p>

    <p class="normal">He returned their coins—three to Callie, five to Brogan—then took a quarter back from Brogan’s hand, leaving four coins. He blew on it, and it was a penny, which he gave to Brogan, who counted his quarters and was dumbfounded to find that he still had all five in his hand.</p>

    <p class="normal">“You’re a Houdini,” cackled Hinzelmann in delight. “That’s what you are!”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Just an amateur,” said Shadow. “I’ve got a long way to go.” Still, he felt a smidgen of pride. It had, he realized, been his first adult audience.</p>

    <p class="normal">He stopped at the food store on the way home to buy a carton of milk. The ginger-haired girl on the checkout counter looked familiar, and her eyes were red-rimmed from crying. Her face was one big freckle.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I know you,” said Shadow. “You’re—” And he was about to say the Alka-Seltzer girl, but bit it back and finished, “You’re Alison’s friend. From the bus. I hope she’s going to be okay.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She sniffed and nodded. “Me too.” She blew her nose on a tissue, hard, and pushed it back into her sleeve.</p>

    <a id="page283"></a> 

    <p class="normal">Her badge said <span class="smallCaps">HI</span>! <span class="smallCaps">I’M</span> SOPHIE! <span class="smallCaps">ASK</span> ME <span class="smallCaps">HOW</span> YOU <span class="smallCaps">CAN LOSE</span> 20 <span class="smallCaps">LBS</span>. <span class="smallCaps">IN</span> 30 <span class="smallCaps">DAYS</span>!</p>

    <p class="normal">“I spent today looking for her. No luck yet.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Sophie nodded, blinked back tears. She waved the milk carton in front of a scanner and it chirped its price at them. Shadow passed her two dollars.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I’m leaving this fucking town,” said the girl in a sudden, choked voice. “I’m going to live with my mom in Ashland. Alison’s gone. Sandy Olsen went last year. Jo Ming the year before that. What if it’s me next year?”</p>

    <p class="normal">“I thought Sandy Olsen was taken by his father.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said the girl, bitterly. “I’m sure he was. And Jo Ming went out to California, and Sarah Lindquist got lost on a trail hike and they never found her. Whatever. I want to go to Ashland.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She took a deep breath and held it for a moment. Then she smiled at him. There was nothing insincere about that smile. It was just the smile of someone who knew that it was her job to smile when she gave someone their change, and as she put Shadow’s change and receipt into his hand she told him to have a nice day. Then she turned to the woman with the full shopping cart behind him and began to unload-and-scan. A boy no older than Sophie sauntered over to bag the groceries.</p>

    <p class="normal">Shadow took his milk and drove away, past the gas station and the klunker on the ice, and over the bridge and home.</p>

    <a id="page284"></a> 

    <p class="chapterDateline"><span class="bold">Coming to America<br/> 1778</span></p>

    <p class="normal1">There was a girl, and her uncle sold her, <span class="italic">wrote Mr. Ibis in his perfect copperplate handwriting.</span></p>

    <p class="normal">That is the tale; the rest is detail.</p>

    <p class="normal">There are stories that are true, in which each individual’s tale is unique and tragic, and the worst of the tragedy is that we have heard it before, and we cannot allow ourselves to feel it too deeply. We build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit, coating it with smooth pearl layers in order to cope. This is how we walk and talk and function, day in, day out, immune to others’ pain and loss. If it were to touch us it would cripple us or make saints of us; but, for the most part, it does not touch us. We cannot allow it to.</p>

    <p class="normal">Tonight, as you eat, reflect if you can: there are children starving in the world, starving in numbers larger than the mind can easily hold, up in the big numbers where an error of a million here, a million there, can be forgiven. It may be uncomfortable for you to reflect upon this or it may not, but still, you will eat.</p>

    <p class="normal">There are accounts which, if we open our hearts to them, will cut us too deeply. Look—here is a good man, good by his own lights and the lights of his friends: he is faithful and true to his wife, he adores and lavishes attention on his little children, he cares about his country, he does his job punctiliously, as best he can. So, efficiently and good-naturedly, he exterminates Jews: he appreciates the music that plays in the background to pacify them; he advises the Jews not to forget their identification numbers as they go into the showers—many people, he tells them, forget their numbers, and take the wrong clothes, when they come out of the showers. This calms the Jews: there will be life, they assure themselves, after the showers. And they are wrong. Our man supervises the detail taking the bodies to the ovens; and if there is anything he feels bad about, it is that he still allows the gassing of vermin to affect him. Were he a truly good man, he knows, he would feel nothing but joy, as the earth is cleansed of its pests.</p>

    <a id="page285"></a> 

    <p class="normal">Leave him; he cuts too deep. He is too close to us and it hurts.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">There was a girl, and her uncle sold her.</span> Put like that it seems so simple.</p>

    <p class="normal"><span class="italic">No man,</span> proclaimed Donne, <span class="italic">is an Island,</span> and he was wrong. If we were not islands, we would be lost, drowned in each others’ tragedies. We are insulated (a word that means, literally, remember, <span class="italic">made into an island</span>) from the tragedy of others, by our island nature, and by the repetitive shape and form of the stories. We know the shape, and the shape does not change. There was a human being who was born, lived, and then, by some means or other, died. There. You may fill in the details from your own experience. As unoriginal as any other tale, as unique as any other life. Lives are snowflakes—unique in detail, forming patterns we have seen before, but as like one another as peas in a pod (and have you ever looked at peas in a pod? I mean, really <span class="italic">looked</span> at them? There’s not a chance you’d mistake one for another, after a minute’s close inspection.)</p>

    <p class="normal">We need individual stories. Without individuals we see only numbers: a thousand dead, a hundred thousand dead, “casualties may rise to a million.” With individual stories, the statistics become people—but even that is a lie, for the people continue to suffer in numbers that themselves are numbing and meaningless. <span class="italic">Look,</span> see the child’s swollen, swollen belly, and the flies that crawl at the corners of his eyes, his skeletal limbs: will it make it easier for you to know his name, his age, his dreams, his fears? To see him from the inside? And if it does, are we not doing a disservice to his sister, who lies in the searing dust beside him, a distorted, distended caricature of a human child? And there, if we feel for them, are they now more important to us than a thousand other children touched by the same famine, a thousand other young lives who will soon be food for the flies’ own myriad squirming children?</p>

    <p class="normal">We draw our lines around these moments of pain, and remain upon our islands, and they cannot hurt us. They are covered with a smooth, safe, nacreous layer to let them slip, pearl-like, from our souls without real pain.</p>

    <p class="normal">Fiction allows us to slide into these other heads, these other places, and look out through other eyes. And then in the tale we stop before we die, or we die vicariously and unharmed, and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book, and we resume our lives.</p>

    <p class="normal">A life, which is, like any other, unlike any other.</p>

    <a id="page286"></a> 

    <p class="normal">And the simple truth is this: <span class="italic">there was a girl and her uncle sold her</span>.</p>

    <p class="normal">This is what they used to say, where the girl came from: no man may be certain who fathered a child, but the mother, ah, that you could be certain of. Lineage and property was something that moved in the matrilineal line, but power remained in the hands of the men: a man had complete ownership of his sister’s children.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was a war in that place, and it was a small war, no more than a skirmish between the men of two rival villages. It was almost an argument. One village won the argument, one village lost it.</p>

    <p class="normal">Life as a commodity, people as possessions. Enslavement had been part of the culture of those parts for thousands of years. The Arab slavers had destroyed the last of the great kingdoms of East Africa, while the West African nations had destroyed each other.</p>

    <p class="normal">There was nothing untoward or unusual about their uncle selling the twins, although twins were considered magical beings, and their uncle was scared of them, scared enough that he did not tell them that they were to be sold in case they harmed his shadow and killed him. They were twelve years old. She was called Wututu, the messenger bird; he was called Agasu, the name of a dead king. They were healthy children, and, because they were twins, male and female, they were told many things about the gods, and because they were twins they listened to the things that they were told, and they remembered.</p>

    <p class="normal">Their uncle was a fat and lazy man. If he had owned more cattle, perhaps he would have given up one of his cattle instead of the children, but he did not. He sold the twins. Enough of him: he shall not enter further into this narrative. We follow the twins.</p>

    <p class="normal">They were marched, with several other slaves taken or sold in the war, for a dozen miles to a small outpost. Here they were traded, and the twins, along with thirteen others, were bought by six men with spears and knives who marched them to the west, toward the sea, and then for many miles along the coast. There were fifteen slaves now altogether, their hands loosely bound, tied neck to neck.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu asked her brother Agasu what would happen to them.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I do not know,” he said. Agasu was a boy who smiled often: his teeth were white and perfect, and he showed them as he grinned, his happy smiles making Wututu happy in her turn. He was not smiling now. In<a id="page287"></a>stead he tried to show bravery for his sister, his head back and shoulders spread, as proud, as menacing, as comical as a puppy with its hackles raised.</p>

    <p class="normal">The man in the line behind Wututu, his cheeks scarred, said, “They will sell us to the white devils, who will take us to their home across the water.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“And what will they do to us there?” demanded Wututu.</p>

    <p class="normal">The man said nothing.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Well?” asked Wututu. Agasu tried to dart a glance over his shoulder. They were not allowed to talk or sing as they walked.</p>

    <p class="normal">“It is possible they will eat us,” said the man. “That is what I have been told. That is why they need so many slaves. It is because they are always hungry.”</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu began to cry as she walked. Agasu said, “Do not cry, my sister. They will not eat you. I shall protect you. Our gods will protect you.”</p>

    <p class="normal">But Wututu continued to cry, walking with a heavy heart, feeling pain and anger and fear as only a child can feel it: raw and overwhelming. She was unable to tell Agasu that she was not worried about the white devils eating her. She would survive, she was certain of it. She cried because she was scared that they would eat her brother, and she was not certain that she could protect him.</p>

    <p class="normal">They reached a trading post, and they were kept there for ten days. In the morning of the tenth day they were taken from the hut in which they had been imprisoned (it had become very crowded in the final days, as men arrived from far away, some of them from hundreds of miles, bringing their own strings and skeins of slaves). They were marched to the harbor, and Wututu saw the ship that was to take them away.</p>

    <p class="normal">Her first thought was how big a ship it was, her second that it was too small for all of them to fit inside. It sat lightly on the water. The ship’s boat came back and forth, ferrying the captives to the ship where they were manacled and arranged in low decks by sailors, some of whom were brick-red or tan skinned, with strange pointy noses and beards that made them look like beasts. Several of the sailors looked like her own people, like the men who had marched her to the coast. The men and the women and the children were separated, forced into different areas on the slave <a id="page288"></a>deck. There were too many slaves for the ship to hold easily, so another dozen men were chained up on the deck in the open, beneath the places where the crew would sling their hammocks.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu was put in with the children, not with the women; and she was not chained, merely locked in. Agasu, her brother, was forced in with the men, in chains, packed like herrings. It stank under that deck, although the crew had scrubbed it down since their last cargo. It was a stink that had entered the wood: the smell of fear and bile and diarrhea and death, of fever and madness and hate. Wututu sat in the hot hold with the other children. She could feel the children on each side of her sweating. A wave tumbled a small boy into her, hard, and he apologized in a tongue that Wututu did not recognize. She tried to smile at him in the semi-darkness.</p>

    <p class="normal">The ship set sail. Now it rode heavy in the water.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu wondered about the place the white men came from (although none of them were truly white: sea-burned and sunburned they were, and their skins were dark). Were they so short of food that they had to send all the way to her land for people to eat? Or was it that she was to be a delicacy, a rare treat for a people who had eaten so many things that only black-skinned flesh in their cook pots made their mouths water?</p>

    <p class="normal">On the second day out of port the ship hit a squall, not a bad one, but the ship’s decks lurched and tumbled, and the smell of vomit joined the mixed smells of urine and liquid feces and fear-sweat. Rain poured down on them in bucketloads from the air gratings set in the ceiling of the slave deck.</p>

    <p class="normal">A week into the voyage, and well out of sight of land, the slaves were allowed out of irons. They were warned that any disobedience, any trouble, and they would be punished more than they had ever imagined.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the morning the captives were fed beans and ship’s biscuits, and a mouthful each of vinegared lime juice, harsh enough that their faces would twist, and they would cough and splutter, and some of them would moan and wail as the lime juice was spooned out. They could not spit it out, though: if they were caught spitting or dribbling it out they were lashed or beaten.</p>

    <p class="normal">The night brought them salted beef. It tasted unpleasant, and there <a id="page289"></a>was a rainbow sheen to the gray surface of the meat. That was at the start of the voyage. As the voyage continued, the meat grew worse.</p>

    <p class="normal">When they could, Wututu and Agasu would huddle together, talking of their mother and their home and their playfellows. Sometimes Wututu would tell Agasu the stories their mother had told them, like those of Elegba, the trickiest of the gods, who was Great Mawu’s eyes and ears in the world, who took messages to Mawu and brought back Mawu’s replies.</p>

    <p class="normal">In the evenings, to while away the monotony of the voyage, the sailors would make the slaves sing for them and dance the dances of their native lands.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu was lucky that she had been put in with the children. The children were packed in tightly and ignored; the women were not always so fortunate. On some slave ships the female slaves were raped repeatedly and continually by the crew, simply as an unspoken perquisite of the voyage. This was not one of those ships, which is not to say that there were no rapes.</p>

    <p class="normal">A hundred men, women and children died on that voyage and were dropped over the side; and some of the captives who were dropped over the side had not yet died, but the green chill of the ocean cooled their final fever and they went down flailing, choking, lost.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu and Agasu were traveling on a Dutch ship, but they did not know this, and it might as easily have been British, or Portuguese, or Spanish, or French.</p>

    <p class="normal">The black crewmen on the ship, their skins even darker than Wututu’s, told the captives where to go, what to do, when to dance. One morning Wututu caught one of the black guards staring at her. When she was eating, the man came over to her and stared down at her, without saying anything.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Why do you do this?” she asked the man. “Why do you serve the white devils?”</p>

    <p class="normal">He grinned at her as if her question was the funniest thing he ever had heard. Then he leaned over, so his lips were almost brushing her ears, so his hot breath on her ear made her suddenly feel sick. “If you were older,” he told her, “I would make you scream with happiness from my penis. Perhaps I will do it tonight. I have seen how well you dance.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She looked at him with her nut-brown eyes and she said, unflinching, <a id="page290"></a>smiling even, “If you put it in me down there I will bite it off with my teeth down there. I am a witch girl, and I have very sharp teeth down there.” She took pleasure in watching his expression change. He said nothing and walked away.</p>

    <p class="normal">The words had come out of her mouth, but they had not been her words: she had not thought them or made them. No, she realized, those were the words of Elegba the trickster. Mawu had made the world and then, thanks to Elegba’s trickery, had lost interest in it. It was Elegba of the clever ways and the iron-hard erection who had spoken through her, who had ridden her for a moment, and that night before she slept she gave thanks to Elegba.</p>

    <p class="normal">Several of the captives refused to eat. They were whipped until they put food into their mouths and swallowed, although the whipping was severe enough that two men died of it. Still, no one else on the ship tried to starve themselves to freedom. A man and a woman tried to kill themselves by leaping over the side. The woman succeeded. The man was rescued and he was tied to the mast and lashed for the better part of a day, until his back ran with blood, and he was left there as the day became night. He was given no food to eat, and nothing to drink but his own piss. By the third day he was raving, and his head had swollen and grown soft, like an old melon. When he stopped raving they threw him over the side. Also, for five days following the escape attempt the captives were returned to their manacles and chains.</p>

    <p class="normal">It was a long journey and a bad one for the captives, and it was not pleasant for the crew, although they had learned to harden their hearts to the business, and pretended to themselves that they were no more than farmers, taking their livestock to the market.</p>

    <p class="normal">They made harbor on a pleasant, balmy day in Bridgetown, Barbados, and the captives were carried from the ship to the shore in low boats sent out from the dock, and taken to the market square, where they were, by dint of a certain amount of shouting, and blows from cudgels, arranged into lines. A whistle blew, and the market square filled with men, poking, prodding, red-faced men, shouting, inspecting, calling, appraising, grumbling.</p>

    <p class="normal">Wututu and Agasu were separated then. It happened so fast—a big man forced open Agasu’s mouth, looked at his teeth, felt his arm muscles, <a id="page291"></a>nodded, and two other men hauled Agasu away. He did not fight them. He looked at Wututu and called “Be brave,” to her. She nodded, and then her vision smeared and blurred with tears, and she wailed. Together they were twins, magical, powerful. Apart they were two children in pain.</p>

    <p class="normal">She never saw him again but once, and never in life.</p>

    <p class="normal">This is what happened to Agasu. First they took him to a seasoning farm, where they whipped him daily for the things he did and didn’t do, they taught him a smattering of English and they gave him the name of Inky Jack, for the darkness of his skin. When he ran away they hunted him down with dogs and brought him back, and cut off a toe with a chisel, to teach him a lesson he would not forget. He would have starved himself to death, but when he refused to eat his front teeth were broken and thin gruel was forced into his mouth, until he had no choice but to swallow or to choke.</p>

    <p class="normal">Even in those times they preferred slaves born into captivity to those brought over from Africa. The free-born slaves tried to run, or they tried to die, and either way, there went the profits.</p>

    <p class="normal">When Inky Jack was sixteen he was sold, with several other slaves, to a sugar plantation on St. Domingue. They called him Hyacinth, the big, broken-toothed slave. He met an old woman from his own village on that plantation—she had been a house slave before her fingers became too gnarled and arthritic—who told him that the whites intentionally split up captives from the same towns and villages and regions, to avoid insurrection and revolts. They did not like it when slaves spoke to each other in their own languages.</p>

    <p class="normal">Hyacinth learned some French, and was taught a few of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Each day he cut sugar cane from well before the sun rose until after the sun had set.</p>

    <p class="normal">He fathered several children. He went with the other slaves, in the small hours of the night, to the woods, although it was forbidden, to dance the Calinda, to sing to Damballa-Wedo, the serpent god, in the form of a black snake. He sang to Elegba, to Ogu, Shango, Zaka, and to many others, all the gods the captives had brought with them to the island, brought in their minds and their secret hearts.</p>

    <p class="normal">The slaves on the sugar plantations of St. Domingue rarely lived more than a decade. The free time they were given—two hours in the heat of <a id="page292"></a>noon, and five hours in the dark of the night (from eleven until four)—was also the only time they had to grow and tend the food they would eat (for they were not fed by their masters, merely given small plots of land to cultivate, with which to feed themselves), and it was also the time they had to sleep and to dream. Even so, they would take that time and they would gather and dance, and sing and worship. The soil of St. Domingue was a fertile soil and the gods of Dahomey and the Congo and the Niger put down thick roots there and grew lush and huge and deep, and they promised freedom to those who worshiped them at night in the groves.</p>

    <p class="normal">Hyacinth was twenty-five years of age when a spider bit the back of his right hand. The bite became infected and the flesh on the back of his hand was necrotic: soon enough his whole arm was swollen and purple, and the hand stank. It throbbed and it burned.</p>

    <p class="normal">They gave him crude rum to drink, and they heated the blade of a machete in the fire until it glowed red and white. They cut his arm off at the shoulder with a saw, and they cauterized it with the burning blade. He lay in a fever for a week. Then he returned to work.</p>

    <p class="normal">The one-armed slave called Hyacinth took part in the slave revolt of 1791.</p>

    <p class="normal">Elegba himself took possession of Hyacinth in the grove, riding him as a white man rode a horse, and spoke through him. He remembered little of what was said, but the others who were with him told him that he had promised them freedom from their captivity. He remembered only his erection, rod-like and painful; and raising both hands—the one he had, and the one he no longer possessed—to the moon.</p>

    <p class="normal">A pig was killed, and the men and the women of that plantation drank the hot blood of the pig, pledging themselves and binding themselves into a brotherhood. They swore that they were an army of freedom, pledged themselves once more to the gods of all the lands from which they had been dragged as plunder.</p>

    <p class="normal">“If we die in battle with the whites,” they told each other, “we will be reborn in Africa, in our homes, in our own tribes.”</p>

    <p class="normal">There was another Hyacinth in the uprising, so they now called Agasu by the name of Big One-Arm. He fought, he worshiped, he sacrificed, he planned. He saw his friends and his lovers killed, and he kept fighting.</p>

    <p class="normal">They fought for twelve years, a maddening, bloody struggle with <a id="page293"></a>the plantation owners, with the troops brought over from France. They fought, and they kept fighting, and, impossibly, they won.</p>

    <p class="normal">On January the first, 1804, the independence of St. Domingue, soon to be known to the world as the Republic of Haiti, was declared. Big One-Arm did not live to see it. He had died in August 1802, bayoneted by a French soldier.</p>

    <p class="normal">At the precise moment of the death of Big One-Arm (who had once been called Hyacinth, and before that, Inky Jack, and who was forever in his heart Agasu), his sister, whom he had known as Wututu, who had been called Mary on her first plantation in the Carolinas, and Daisy when she had become a house slave, and Sukey when she was sold to the Lavere family down the river in New Orleans, felt the cold bayonet slide between her ribs and started to scream and weep uncontrollably. Her twin daughters woke and began to howl. They were cream-and-coffee colored, her new babies, not like the black children she had borne when she was on the plantation and little more than a girl herself—children she had not seen since they were fifteen and ten years old. The middle girl had been dead for a year, when she was sold away from them.</p>

    <p class="normal">Sukey had been whipped many times since she had come ashore—once, salt had been rubbed into the wounds, on another occasion she had been whipped so hard and for so long that she could not sit, or allow anything to touch her back, for several days. She had been raped several times when younger: by black men who had been ordered to share her wooden palette, and by white men. She had been chained. She had not wept then, though. Since her brother had been taken from her she had only wept once. It was in North Carolina, when she had seen the food for the slave children and the dogs poured into the same trough, and she had seen her little children scrabbling with the dogs for the scraps. She saw that happen one day—and she had seen it before, every day on that plantation, and she would see it again many times before she left—she saw it that one day and it broke her heart.</p>

    <p class="normal">She had been beautiful for a while. Then the years of pain had taken their toll, and she was no longer beautiful. Her face was lined, and there was too much pain in those brown eyes.</p>

    <p class="normal">Eleven years earlier, when she was twenty-five, her right arm had withered. None of the white folk had known what to make of it. The flesh <a id="page294"></a>seemed to melt from the bones, and now her right arm hung by her side, little more than a skeletal arm covered in skin, and almost immobile. After this she had become a house-slave.</p>

    <p class="normal">The Casterton family, who had owned the plantation, were impressed by her cooking and house skills, but Mrs. Casterton found the withered arm unsettling, and so she was sold to the Lavere family, who were out for a year from Louisiana: M. Lavere was a fat, cheerful man, who was in need of a cook and a maid of all work, and who was not in the slightest repulsed by the slave Daisy’s withered arm. When, a year later, they returned to Louisiana, slave Sukey went with them.</p>

    <p class="normal">In New Orleans the women came to her, and the men also, to buy cures and love charms and little fetishes, black folks, yes, of course, but white folks too. The Lavere family turned a blind eye to it. Perhaps they enjoyed the prestige of having a slave who was feared and respected. They would not, however, sell her her freedom.</p>

    <p class="normal">Sukey went into the bayou late at night, and she danced the Calinda and the Bamboula. Like the dancers of St. Domingue and the dancers of her native land, the dancers in the bayou had a black snake as their <span class="italic">voudon;</span> even so, the gods of her homeland and of the other African nations did not possess her people as they had possessed her brother and the folk of St. Domingue. She would still invoke them and call their names, to beg them for favors.</p>

    <p class="normal">She listened when the white folk spoke of the revolt in St. Domingo (as they called it), and how it was doomed to fail—“Think of it! A cannibal land!”—and then she observed that they no longer spoke of it.</p>

    <p class="normal">Soon, it seemed to her that they pretended that there never had been a place called St. Domingo, and as for Haiti, the word was never mentioned. It was as if the whole American nation had decided that they could, by an effort of belief, command a good-sized Caribbean island to no longer exist merely by willing it so.</p>

    <p class="normal">A generation of Lavere children grew up under Sukey’s watchful eye. The youngest, unable to say “Sukey” as a child, had called her Mama Zouzou, and the name had stuck. Now the year was 1821, and Sukey was in her mid-fifties. She looked much older.</p>

    <p class="normal">She knew more of the secrets than old Sanité Dédé, who sold candies in front of the Cabildo, more than Marie Saloppé, who called herself the <a id="page295"></a>voodoo queen: both were free women of color, while Mama Zouzou was a slave, and would die a slave, or so her master had said.</p>

    <p class="normal">The young woman who came to her to find what had happened to her husband styled herself the Widow Paris. She was high-breasted and young and proud. She had African blood in her, and European blood, and Indian blood. Her skin was reddish, her hair was a gleaming black. Her eyes were black and haughty. Her husband, Jacques Paris, was, perhaps, dead. He was three-quarters white as these things were calculated, and the bastard of a once-proud family, one of the many immigrants who had fled from St. Domingo, and as freeborn as his striking young wife.</p>

    <p class="normal">“My Jacques. Is he dead?” asked the Widow Paris. She was a hair-dresser who went from home to home, arranging the coiffures of the elegant ladies of New Orleans before their demanding social engagements.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mama Zouzou consulted the bones, then shook her head. “He is with a white woman, somewhere north of here,” she said. “A white woman with golden hair. He is alive.” This was not magic. It was common knowledge in New Orleans just with whom Jacques Paris had run off, and the color of her hair.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mama Zouzou was surprised to realize that the Widow Paris did not already know that Jacques was sticking his quadroon little <span class="italic">pipi</span> into a pink-skinned girl up in Colfax every night. Well, on the nights that he was not so drunk he could use it for nothing better than pissing. Perhaps she did know. Perhaps she had another reason for coming.</p>

    <p class="normal">The Widow Paris came to see the old slave woman one or two times a week. After a month she brought gifts for the old woman: hair ribbons, and a seed-cake, and a black rooster.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Mama Zouzou,” said the girl, “it is time for you to teach me what you know.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Yes,” said Mama Zouzou, who knew which way the wind blew. And besides, the Widow Paris had confessed that she had been born with webbed toes, which meant that she was a twin and she had killed her twin in the womb. What choice did Mama Zouzou have?</p>

    <p class="normal">She taught the girl that two nutmegs hung upon a string around the neck until the string breaks will cure heart murmurs, while a pigeon that has never flown, cut open and laid on the patient’s head, will draw a fever. She showed her how to make a wishing bag, a small leather bag contain<a id="page296"></a>ing thirteen pennies, nine cotton seeds and the bristles of a black hog, and how to rub the bag to make wishes come true.</p>

    <p class="normal">The Widow Paris learned everything that Mama Zouzou told her. She had no real interest in the gods, though. Not really. Her interests were in the practicalities. She was delighted to learn that if you dip a live frog in honey and place it in an ants’ nest, then, when the bones are cleaned and white, a close examination will reveal a flat, heart-shaped bone, and another with a hook on it: the bone with the hook on it must be hooked onto the garment of the one you wish to love you, while the heart-shaped bone must be kept safely (for if it is lost, your loved one will turn on you like an angry dog). Infallibly, if you do this, the one you love will be yours.</p>

    <p class="normal">She learned that dried snake powder, placed in the face powder of an enemy, will produce blindness, and that an enemy can be made to drown herself by taking a piece of her underwear, turning it inside out, and burying it at midnight under a brick.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mama Zouzou showed the Widow Paris the World Wonder Root, the great and the little roots of John the Conqueror, she showed her dragon’s blood, and valerian and five-finger grass. She showed her how to brew waste-away tea, and follow-me water and faire-Shingo water.</p>

    <p class="normal">All these things and more Mama Zouzou showed the Widow Paris. Still, it was disappointing for the old woman. She did her best to teach her the hidden truths, the deep knowledge, to tell her of Elegba, of Mawu, of Aido-Hwedo the <span class="italic">voudon</span> serpent, and the rest, but the Widow Paris (I shall now tell you the name she was born with, and the name she later made famous: it was Marie Laveau. But this was not the great Marie Laveau, the one you have heard of, this was her mother, who eventually became the Widow Glapion), she had no interest in the gods of the distant land. If St. Domingo had been a lush black earth for the African gods to grow in, this land, with its corn and its melons, its crawfish and its cotton, was barren and infertile.</p>

    <p class="normal">“She does not want to know,” complained Mama Zouzou to Clémentine, her confidant, who took in the washing for many of the houses in that district, washing their curtains and coverlets. Clémentine had a blossom of burns on her cheek, and one of her children had been scalded to death when a copper overturned.</p>

    <a id="page297"></a> 

    <p class="normal">“Then do not teach her,” says Clémentine.</p>

    <p class="normal">“I teach her, but she does not see what is valuable—all she sees is what she can do with it. I give her diamonds, but she cares only for pretty glass. I give her a demi-<span class="italic">bouteille</span> of the best claret and she drinks river water. I give her quail and she wishes to eat only rat.”</p>

    <p class="normal">“Then why do you persist?” asks Clémentine.</p>

    <p class="normal">Mama Zouzou shrugs her thin shoulders, causing her withered arm to shake.</p>

    <p class="normal">She cannot answer. She could say that she teaches because she is grateful to be alive, and she is: she has seen too many die. She could say that she dreams that one day the slaves will rise, as they rose (and were defeated) in LaPlace, but that she knows in her heart that without the gods of Africa they will never overcome their white captors, will never return to their homelands.</p>

    <p class="normal">When she woke that terrible night almost twenty years earlier, and felt the cold steel between her ribs, that was when Mama Zouzou’s life had ended. Now she was someone who did not live, who simply hated. If you asked her about the hate she would have been unable to tell you about a twelve-year-old girl on a stinking ship: that had scabbed over in her mind—there had been too many whippings and beatings, too many nights in manacles, too many partings, too much pain. She could have told you about her son, though, and how his thumb had been cut off when their master discovered the boy was able to read and to write. She could have told you of her daughter, twelve years old and already eight months pregnant by an overseer, and how they dug a hole in the red earth to take her daughter’s pregnant belly, and then they whipped her until her back had bled. Despite the carefully dug hole, her daughter had lost her baby and her life on a Sunday morning, when all the white folks were in church…</p>

    <p class="normal">Too much pain.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Worship them,” Mama Zouzou told the young Widow Paris in the bayou, one hour after midnight. They were both naked to the waist, sweating in the humid night, their skins given accents by the white moonlight.</p>

    <p class="normal">The Widow Paris’s husband Jacques (whose own death, three years later, would have several remarkable features) had told Marie a little <a id="page298"></a>about the gods of St. Domingo, but she did not care. Power came from the rituals, not from the gods.</p>

    <p class="normal">Together Mama Zouzou and the Widow Paris crooned and stamped and keened in the swamp. They were singing in the blacksnakes, the free woman of color and the slave woman with the withered arm.</p>

    <p class="normal">“There is more to it than just, you prosper, your enemies fail,” said Mama Zouzou.</p>

    <p class="normal">Many of the words of the ceremonies, words she knew once, words her brother had also known, these words had fled from her memory. She told pretty Marie Laveau that the words did not matter, only the tunes and the beats, and there, singing and tapping in the blacksnakes, in the swamp, she has an odd vision. She sees the beats of the songs, the Calinda beat, the Bamboula beat, all the rhythms of equatorial Africa spreading slowly across this midnight land until the whole country shivers and swings to the beats of the old gods whose realms she had left. And even that, she understands somehow, in the swamp, even that will not be enough.</p>

    <p class="normal">She turns to pretty Marie and sees herself through Marie’s eyes, a black-skinned old woman, her face lined, her bony arm hanging limply by her side, her eyes the eyes of one who has seen her children fight in the trough for food from the dogs. She saw herself, and she knew then for the first time the revulsion and the fear the younger woman had for her.</p>

    <p class="normal">Then she laughed, and crouched, and picked up in her good hand a blacksnake as tall as a sapling and as thick as a ship’s rope.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Here,” she said. “Here will be our <span class="italic">voudon</span>.”</p>

    <p class="normal">She dropped the unresisting snake into a basket that yellow Marie was carrying.</p>

    <p class="normal">And then, in the moonlight, the second sight possessed her for a final time, and she saw her brother Agasu, not the twelve-year-old boy she had last seen in the Bridgetown market so long ago, but a huge man, bald and grinning with broken teeth, his back lined with deep scars. In one hand he held a machete-knife. His right arm was barely a stump.</p>

    <p class="normal">She reached out her own good left hand.</p>

    <p class="normal">“Stay, stay a while,” she whispered. “I will be there. I will be with you soon.”</p>

    <p class="normal">And Marie Paris thought the old woman was speaking to her.</p>
