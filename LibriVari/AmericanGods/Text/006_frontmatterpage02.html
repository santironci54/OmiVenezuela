      <p class="normal1"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he book you’re holding is slightly different from the version of the book that was previously published.</p>

      <p class="normal">Shortly after it was published, Pete Atkins and Peter Schneider, the partners in Hill House Publishers, a (now, alas, defunct) small-press book publisher, arranged with the book’s U.S. publishers to do a special edition of <span class="italic">American Gods.</span> As they told me about the wonderful treats they had planned for the limited edition—something they planned to be a miracle of the bookmaker’s art—I began feeling more and more uncomfortable with the text that they would be using.</p>

      <p class="normal">Would they, I inquired rather diffidently, be willing to use my original, untrimmed text?</p>

      <p class="normal">As it turned out, they would.</p>

      <p class="normal">And then it became more complicated, as I realized that, of course, <span class="italic">after</span> I had trimmed <span class="italic">American Gods</span>, I had made other editorial corrections and changes, many of which were for the better. So the only way someone could create a definitive <span class="italic">American Gods</span> text would be by comparing my final, unedited version with my final edited version, and then with the final printed version (because I had cheerfully scrawled changes on the galley proofs, and just as cheerfully not actually bothered to keep track of them), and then making a number of judgment calls.</p>

      <p class="normal">It was going to be an enormous amount of work. So I did the only sane thing under the circumstances that I could do: I sent several enormous <a id="pagexiv"></a>computer files and two copies of the book (the English and the American editions) to Pete Atkins, along with my list of errors and typos I’d noticed since the book was published, and I asked him to sort it out. He did, excellently. Then I took the manuscript that Pete had prepared and went through it myself, fixing things and tidying and sometimes restoring cuts I’d made for a reason that wasn’t just making the book shorter, to come up with a final version of the text that I was perfectly happy with (given that a novel is always, as I might have mentioned, a long piece of prose with something wrong with it).</p>

      <p class="normal">Hill House published it in a limited edition of about 750 copies (described as “a miracle of the bookmaker’s art” and not by them this time). It was very expensive. I’m grateful that my publishers were willing to publish the expanded version of the book on the tenth anniversary of its publication, and in a much larger edition than 750 copies, and for a lot less money. The version of <span class="italic">American Gods</span> that you are holding is about twelve thousand words longer than the one that won all the awards, and it’s the version of which I’m the most proud.</p>

      <p class="normal">I would like to thank Jennifer Hershey, who was the book’s original editor, Jennifer Brehl, who midwifed this edition to the world, and above all I would like to thank Pete Atkins for his help in the preparation of this manuscript.</p>
