  <h1>26</h1>

  <p class="normal">THE Archkerri trotted elephantinely up to them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He was trying to tell me that the gateway was moving," he said. "It apparently has been moving very slowly all along. That would, I think, be because the aggregation of matter in space, which makes the gateway, is also changing in density and location. The end of the log was about to slip off when I started over it!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He buzzed the equivalent of "Whew!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know if that hairy-faced man intended to come back over the log or if he just wanted to take one last look at this universe. Whatever the reason, it is indeed fortunate that he emerged. Otherwise, I would have dropped quite a distance. I am tough but not tough enough to survive a fall from that altitude."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wonder where that water came from," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've a theory about that, which I'll tell you about later. It involves a satellite of Earth and its effect upon the ocean. I'm more interested in that man. He was wearing garments which I've seen depicted in my prism, but men wore them only during a brief period early in their history. That was an unimaginable number of sleep-times ago, unimaginable to you, I mean.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why was he wearing them? And the hair on his face? Men haven't had facial hair for a thousand times a thousand times four hundred sleep-times. Obviously, then, the man is by no means our contemporary. If not, then what is he? It is most puzzling, very engaging."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think he was a demon who assumed the form of an ancient," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed scornful contempt.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's more believable than that he could be an ancient who'd lived since man's early days," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">For five sleep-times, the shimmering continued to spill water at regular intervals. Then it ceased. Sloosh made a rope to which he tied a heavy rock. He heaved it through the shimmering, where it remained. Then he tied the other end of the rope to a tree trunk. Two more sleep-times passed, the rope tightened, and the rock fell out of the shimmering.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's moving," the plant-man said. "Upward at an angle."</p>

  <p class="normal">In the meantime, he had gone down to the base of the cliff above which the shimmering hovered. He tasted the water that had fallen from it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Salty. The ocean there, if it is an ocean and not a lake, contains salt. So did Earth's at one time and several times after that. Perhaps that other planet in that other universe is a young one. That doesn't mean that if we should get through another gateway, we'll find ourselves in the world to which this gateway is the entrance. There must be many universes, and so there can be different gateways to these."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh finally decided that the hairy-faced stranger had not originated in Earth's universe. It seemed to him highly unlikely that he had come on purpose to this island to enter the gateway. How could he know there was one here? Not only that, but a thorough search of the shore had failed to yield any craft which he might have used to get to the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, the man had come into this world from the neighboring one.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But he cut down a tree here to make a log-bridge to get to the gateway," Deyv said. "He didn't make one in his world to get to ours,"</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. What must have happened is that he came through from his world when the gateway was much lower in ours than when we found it. The gateway ascended afterward, and he had to cut a log here to get back."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri was worried that the gateway which Feersh said was in The Shemibob's land might no longer be there. It, too, must be changing location. Or it might even have disappeared.</p>

  <p class="normal">Meanwhile, Sloosh also looked the dead sailship-beast over very carefully. For a while, he'd thought that perhaps they could right it, launch it, and sail it back to the mainland. He gave up the idea when he considered the labor it would take to do all this.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv organized the slaves and Feersh's family to make boats. In a comparatively short time they had four dugouts of varying sizes, each fitted with a mast and sail. But these were swept away when an earthquake shook the island, which was followed sometime later by a tremendous sea wave. They all had to flee to higher ground to save themselves. The carcass of the sail-beast was also carried far out and, presumably, sunk. The upper part of the cliff near the shimmering broke off during the quake and fell to its base. About a fourth of the trees on the island were uprooted.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometime during the near-catastrophe, the shimmering pivoted a half-circle. Sloosh was the first to see this. He came huffing and puffing into the camp from the other side of the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If you stand behind the shimmering, you can't see it," he buzzed. "You have to go around to the other side for it to be visible."</p>

  <p class="normal">"So what does that mean?" Vana asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What it means is that we may have passed other shimmerings and not seen them because we were on the wrong side. And the same thing may happen in the future. It is most disconcerting. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Vana listened politely and then resumed making a second dugout. They had no intention of going through a gateway unless someone forced them, and then they'd have to be thrown through. Also, they had decided that this time the boats would not be a community venture. They would make their own, and if the others didn't want to, so much the worse for them.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Deyv and Vana weren't working on the boat, hunting, eating, or sleeping, they stood on a promontory and watched the sail-beasts. From their observations they were convinced that they could sail against the wind, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">Once, Sloosh came up to stand beside them while they watched.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Those white slugs you see on their decks are the young of those beasts," he said. "The larvae, in fact. After a certain amount of time, the larvae change form and go into the sea. They metamorphose into small duplicates of the mother. After a while, they become adults. The male beasts fight for the females, and the winner then has to chase down the females to prove how good a sailor he is. From their union the eggs are fertilized, and these hatch out the slugs. And so on."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do they manage to mate?" Vana asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know. I do have three different speculations, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">In his circuitous way, Sloosh was leading up to a lecture on the <i>tharakorm.</i> These, he said, were sailship-beasts of the air. Well, not really animals, since they were composed of viri, and they didn't mate. But they were, in a way, higher on the evolutionary ladder than their oceanic animal analogs.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What has been happening in the last stages of Earth's existence is that Nature, or the Creator, or call it what you will, has burst out with many previously unknown life-forms. It has done this, I'm convinced, so that some life will be saved from the final catastrophe. Animals that had never given rise to any form of sapiency are now doing so. Take the Yawtl, for instance. He comes from a species that once was confined to quadrupedal locomotion. A very successful form in its place, but still it seemed impossible that it would ever evolve into a biped with fingers and a thumb and a brain the size of man's. Yet, here it is. Too late, unfortunately, because the Yawtl, though it is self-conscious and intelligent, doesn't have time to evolve a brain which can figure out a way to save itself from the holocaust.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But for that matter, man, who's been on Earth far far longer than the Yawtl, doesn't seem to have the intelligence to save himself either. Though I may be wrong.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Then there is the Tsimmanbul. It developed from a highly intelligent sea-mammal. In fact, it had a sapiency the equal of man's when man first evolved from the ape. But it couldn't use it, at least not as man did, because of its environment and its form, which kept it from the land. Until recently, anyway.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And look at the Archkerri. We evolved from a plant form, though we have a tradition that the ancient humans helped us do this, just as they helped the Tsimmanbul. In any event, we are the vegetable kingdom's leap into sentiency, its final desperate effort to make a form which will survive the coming doom.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are other sapient forms of the animal kingdom, which we may or may not encounter during this quest. There is only one sapient form of the plant kingdom. And so far as I know, the mineral kingdom hasn't produced a champion. But then I don't know everything, no matter how I may appear to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">"And then there is the <i>tharakorm,</i> the end product of the half-alive, half-dead kingdom. It is without self-consciousness or a brain, as we know brains. Nevertheless, it may survive where all the other kingdoms perish. I should modify that. The mineral kingdom will not perish, but it will lose its present forms, all melted into one cosmic ball of fire at the end.</p>

  <p class="normal">"However, the tharakorm, which is now confined to sailing the air, may become a sailor of space itself. It is evolving toward that state now. For all I know, there may be some tharakorm which have already succeeded in leaving this atmosphere. They could be voyaging through space, outward bound, their sails spread to catch the light of the dying universe and be pushed by it toward that space where there is no matter whatsoever. That is, of course, if there can be such a thing as space without matter.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But when the big bang comes, and a new universe is born, the tremendous expulsion of light will also push the <i>tharakorm</i> away from the ejected matter. No pieces will catch up with the sailship-things of outer space. Eventually, when there are abysses of space between the various pieces of matter, and stars are forming, the <i>tharakorm</i> will sail toward them. They will fall into worlds where air has formed, and they will be dissolved, and once again viri will live in unassociated forms on these worlds.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There will be countless <i>tharakorm</i> or their equivalents falling upon countless planets. That is because, I surmise, <i>tharakorm</i> will have formed on every inhabited planet now falling toward its fiery doom. And those which come back from the far reaches of truly empty space to habitable planets will, as I've said, revert to the unassociated forms. And these will evolve into forms that are fully alive, the too-tiny-to-be-seen single-celled plants and animals that are the basis of fully alive forms, plants and animals. At one time, the ancients believed that life was formed in the warm soup seas of young planets. But that is not true. Full life evolved from half-life, the countless things that made up the <i>tharakorm</i> or similar forms.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's possible that this process has been going on since the first cosmic egg of flaming matter hatched. Universes are born and expand, contract and become fires, explode and expand, contract and become fires, and so on. But life in its many forms continues, passed on from one world to the next in a half-alive, half-dead state.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Meanwhile, the increasing density of matter in every contracting universe forms strange, temporary, but not unpassable gateways to other universes. And it is these that enable those forms of life which cannot survive as the <i>tharakorm</i> do to get to young universes. Perhaps."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Vana were awed at these visions, though they didn't really believe they were true.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "This is all very well, but how does it concern me? I won't live nearly as long as a <i>tharakorm,</i> and these gateways terrify me. They are not guaranteed entrances to places where the Earth won't die—for an unimaginably long time yet. Anyway, what is life to me without my own soul egg and my tribe, the people I know and love?</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, I'm not going one step further on this crazy quest of yours. I'm going home to live out my life, as all men should do, and I'll die when my time comes, as all men should do."</p>

  <p class="normal">"After all that you've seen?" Sloosh said, and he walked away.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You are right, of course," Vana said. "However, what if you do get back to your native land? Only to be captured by a woman of another tribe and then have to live the rest of your life with a strange tribe? That happens now and then to your people, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, but the nine tribes in my area are not complete strangers," he said. "I've met them during the Trading Season. Besides, the tribe of my wife, when I get one, will then become my own. And I will see my relatives during the Season. It's not that bad. What is bad is to be without a tribe at all."</p>

  <p class="normal">When Deyv and Vana had finished the dugout, they took it out at once for a trial sail. Though they upset the boat a .number of times, they finally became fairly skillful sailors. Meantime, the others had completed their larger craft, and they too experimented on the waters close to shore. Whenever the sail-beasts approached them, they quickly retreated to the shallows. This maneuver always worked except when one of the immature beasts chased them. Then they had to beach their boats and wait until the young predator gave up on them.</p>

  <p class="normal">After one such incident, Vana said, "I really don't see how we're going to get to the mainland. We'd have to be very lucky to escape being noticed by them. I just don't feel like trusting to luck. I've a feeling that we've used up all that the gods gave us at our birth."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was inclined to agree with her, but he couldn't stand the idea of spending the rest of his life on the island. The slaves and Feersh's children, except Jowanarr, were seriously considering this. They'd said nothing while the boat making was going on. But now that the setting-out was due—overdue, actually—they were close to mutiny. Feersh railed at them and threatened them with torture and death. Her sons didn't laugh at her, but the slaves weren't hesitant to tell her that she was no longer the feared witch. She was just an old woman whose only weapon was her sharp venomous tongue. One slave, Shlip, dared to tell her that if she didn't shut up he'd wring her scrawny neck. Feersh turned red, so red that she looked as if she were going to have a stroke. Gasping, she swayed, then had to sit down to keep from falling.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl enjoyed this very much. He agreed that the dissenters were probably right. Nevertheless, he wasn't going to stay. What was needed was some other method of travel. He'd have to think about it. But since this required some time, he wasn't going to leave yet either.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh had been observing the birds and winged animals. Shortly after Feersh had been put down by the slave, the Archkerri returned to the camp from the other side of the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I've been watching the birds for quite a while. There are those who make this place their permanent home. And there are those who fly in from the mainland, stay awhile, then fly on out over the water. They must be going on to land across the waters. Which means that this is not the ocean but a lake." He paused, then said, "Unless they're going to another island."</p>

  <p class="normal">"You can do what you want to do," Deyv said. "I'll wish you good fortune, though. You've been a good comrade, even if you are rather exasperating at times."</p>

  <p class="normal">"The same to you," the plant-man said. "There have been times when I've almost thought of you as an Archkerri. If only you could think as clearly as I do . . ."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv's warmth toward him was threaded with another feeling. This was not just sadness at having to leave him. It was something close to panic. Somehow the Archkerri had become a substitute for the man's soul egg. He wasn't a completely satisfactory replacement, far from it. But Sloosh had given Deyv a certain amount of security, and the Archkerri's wisdom, however distorted it was in some ways, had made Deyv feel toward him as he'd felt toward his grandmother. Several times he'd had to repress the impulse to ask Sloosh to cuddle him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sleep-time after sleep-time passed. Still, nobody had said, "Now is the time to set out." There were too many sail-beasts cruising around the island and too many giant fish exploding from the water.</p>

  <p class="normal">One day Deyv was up on the promontory, watching the marine life, when Sloosh joined him and said, "I've observed that the adult sailship-beasts never attack the young ones."</p>

  <p class="normal">Smiling, Deyv turned toward the Archkerri.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You just gave me an idea. We'll capture a young beast that's not too large to handle. And we'll sail it back to the land."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed an exclamation, then said, "Why didn't I think of that? Because it's too aggressive an idea? Sometimes, in certain situations, personality can be more valuable than intelligence. However ... let me consider this."</p>

  <p class="normal">After a while he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"How do you propose to control the beast?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think I know how to do that. Now, here's what I have in mind."</p>
