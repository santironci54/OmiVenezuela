  <h1>16</h1>

  <p class="normal">THERE it is," Sloosh said, pointing down. "The Yawtl's impression."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv looked but of course didn't see the tracks. What he did see was a very wide valley through the center of which a river snaked. All five were standing high on the slope of a mountain. The plant-man had insisted that they climb over it so that he could get a view of a large expanse of territory. The labor had been hard but had paid off.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The thief came around the foot of that mountain," Sloosh said. He indicated one to his left. "Then he made a dugout or a raft and went down the river to that point there." His finger jabbed toward a mountain across the valley to the right. "He abandoned his dugout or raft and went through that pass there."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana groaned and said, "I hope he's getting close to his home. Do you realize that we must have traveled over four hundred miles?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Five hundred and fifty-six to be exact," Sloosh said. "That is, if you include both horizontal and vertical travel."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv didn't ask him how he could be so certain. Though the plant-man had little sense of time, he seemed to have a inborn sense of distance. Actually, Deyv's own idea of it was rather vague. A <i>vathakishmikl,</i> a mile, was a measure which depended upon psychical as well as physical factors. If a <i>half-vathakishmikl</i> tired you as much as a full <i>vathakishmikl</i> did, then one length was equal to the other.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh estimated that the travel from where they were to the place at which the Yawtl had left the river would take four sleep-times. That is, approximately forty miles. But if the terrain slowed them down, then it might be fifty miles. Or even more.</p>

  <p class="normal">As it turned out, it took them sixty miles. What delayed them was the Athmau.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went down the mountain, built a raft with a rudder, and floated down to where the thief's trail went ashore. The path he'd taken led them to a village on a tributary of the river. After sneaking around this, they traveled on another much less used path. Two sleep-times later, they came to an open area. Long before they reached it, they heard a hubbub which made them very cautious.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the jungle they peered out at an interesting but possibly dangerous situation.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the midst of the clearing was a low broad hill made of a cementlike substance resembling that which the honey beetles excreted. It was dotted with numerous small holes. At the moment hordes of creatures were pouring out of them to defend themselves. These were a strange mixture, purple antlike things about a foot long and six inches high, covered all over with breathing pipes, ten- to twelve-foot-long snakes, and furry bipedal mammals. The latter were about two feet high and gray-colored except for their badgerlike faces, which were white. Their paws were wide and armed with short curving nails. Their teeth looked like the teeth of humans.</p>

  <p class="normal">A hundred or so human warriors, all wearing wet bark-cloth filters over their noses and mouths, were battling the hill-things. They had the light skin, thin lips, and kinky yellow hair of Vana's tribe. Deyv thought they must be from three different tribes who had banded together for the onslaught. A third of them wore feathered headdresses; another, fur caps with horns; and the rest, tall conical hats of woven reeds. All carried shields with the different tribal markings, and they fought with spears, axes, and flails. Some carried nets, but these warriors hung behind the others until a furry biped had been seized. Then they dashed in and threw the net over the captive, tied it up, and dragged it off struggling to the edge of the clearing.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Athmau," Deyv said. "I've heard of them, though they live far away from my tribe. My grandfather, however, said he once brought one home."</p>

  <p class="normal">He became aware of a musky reek and said, "That strange odor's from the Athmau. We'd better move on."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh was curious, as usual. "Why the face masks?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Athmau exudes a perfume which makes those who breathe it very happy but also very indolent. That's why the tribes are raiding. They want to bring the Athmau to their villages. They'll put them in cages and then enjoy them. The trouble is, the Athmau don't breed in captivity, and they die too soon."</p>

  <p class="normal">There were about ten of the little animals in nets, lying together, five warriors standing guard over them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Their captors had paid for them, however. The poisonous snakes had felled four men; the long mandibles of the antoids had severely wounded six and killed three. And the Athmau's claws had dragged down and ripped apart five.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why don't they just stay in the hill?" Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"If they did, they'd be smoked out. They know that, so they come out and fight. At least, that's what my grandfather said."</p>

  <p class="normal">By now the men were outnumbered six to one. Though the flails crushed the antoids and the spears stabbed the snakes, there weren't enough men to stop the hill-things. A tall warrior wearing an orange kilt, the only such color among the raiders, blew a piercing note on a bone whistle. Immediately, the warriors turned and ran for the jungle. The netted Athmau were picked up and carried away.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, one of the furry bipeds was being pursued by two men. It ran directly toward the hiding place of the travelers.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "Run!"</p>

  <p class="normal">It was too late. Before they could get back on the path, the Athmau had burst through the foliage and was among them. Behind it came the two warriors. One of them threw his axe, and its blunt side caught the animal on the back of his head. It was an excellent throw, doing just what it was intended to do. It stunned the Athmau, which fell by Deyv's feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Aejip leaped for the axe thrower's throat. Jum grabbed the leg of the other, whose spear was raised to drive into the dog's back. Vana forestalled him by hitting him on the head with the sharp edge of her axe. Then she slammed the tomahawk into the side of the other warrior's head. Aejip finished him off.</p>

  <p class="normal">Meanwhile, Deyv had sat down with the Athmau in his arms. He cuddled it, rocking it back and forth, and looking pleased and dreamy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana started toward him. Sloosh buzzed, "Stop! He's been caught by the perfume! Don't go near him! I'll do it!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri grabbed hold of the still half-senseless creature. Deyv tightened his embrace on it. Sloosh said, "Let loose!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He lifted the Athmau up with Deyv clinging to it. At that moment another warrior, bleeding from a dozen wounds, staggered through the bush. Aejip leaped on him, and the man went down screaming.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh dropped Deyv and the Athmau, and he grabbed Deyv's hands and pulled them outward. The animal fell away, rolled over, then stood up unsteadily, chirruping. Sloosh seized it and threw it at least ten feet. It rolled away behind a bush.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana pulled Deyv to his feet. He stood smiling, seeming not to hear her cries to run. By then the cat had stopped the warrior's screams by tearing out his throat. The yells of men on the other side of the bushes showed that they were aware that something was wrong.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana took Deyv's hand and pulled him along, at the same time ordering Aejip and Jum to leave the trail. She dragged Deyv off it after them, and Sloosh joined them a few seconds later. By the time they'd pushed and shoved their way through the dense undergrowth, far enough so that the tribesmen's voices were faint, Deyv had begun to recover.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What happened?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana told him. He looked ashamed, but he said, "I couldn't help it. And it was a wonderful experience. Better even than when I chew <i>thrathyumi."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"Think about that when they find you and kill you," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said angrily, "It wasn't my fault."</p>

  <p class="normal">By then the warriors were beating the bush. Sloosh led his companions through the heavy thick vegetation, his great body crushing the growth. He made noise, but their hunters were yelling so loudly at each other and thrashing around so much that they wouldn't be able to hear the Archkerri. After a long struggle, the party came to a trail. Possibly, this was the one they'd left, but the tracks in the soft earth indicated that they had been made by some very large hoofed animals.</p>

  <p class="normal">Presently, they came to another plain covered with yellow grass, dotted here and there with trees. Halfway across, they heard the yells of their pursuers. These warriors had come out of the same trail and now, twenty strong, were running after them, their spears held high.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said that there was only one thing they could do. Which they did. They removed the cube from his back, and he pulled out its , rod. By the time the warriors reached them, they found the cylinder fully expanded and their quarry inside. Fortunately, the wind wasn't strong enough to roll the cylinder with its occupants.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a long while, during which they heard no sound, Sloosh opened the door. A cautious reconnoiter convinced him that the men had given up. Since there had been no beating on the walls, the warriors probably hadn't even come close to this strange and thus scary object.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh looked across the plain at its far end.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There are the impressions of the Yawtl. We won't have to backtrack to pick them up."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv awoke after the next sleep-time to find the rooms of the vehicle ablaze with light. He jumped up, his heart beating hard, and called, "Sloosh!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The plant-man appeared from the next room a minute later. "I found the plate that activates the mechanisms that provide the illumination."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where does it come from?" Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"From the entire material itself. Note that there are no shadows. I have also located the plates for the illumination of individual rooms. I'm progressing, progressing."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was pleased that they would no longer have to be in the dark. However, the Archkerri's investigations made him uneasy. One of these times he was going to make a mistake and press the wrong plate. Then, willy-nilly, they'd be flying through the air with no idea of how to pilot the vehicle.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went on through a high pass, and they came to another valley. This was far broader than the one behind them. Sloosh stood looking down the slope at the smaller mountains in the valley.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The trail ends there."</p>

  <p class="normal">A river twisted and turned from one end of the horizon to the other. In the middle it split to form around a large island. Something tiny hung above it, gleaming whitely.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I hope it's where he lives and that he's not just resting," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">It took them two sleep-times to get to the foot of the mountain but a short time to reach the river. They made another raft with a rudder and floated down, using a sweep to give them more control. The river was about a mile across until they came to the roughly diamond-shaped island. Here the right branch was only half a mile across. It was unusually heavily populated with <i>athaksum.</i> These came close to the raft, regarding its passengers with cold blue eyes though making no attack. A swimmer would not have lasted long.</p>

  <p class="normal">The object hanging above the island was larger. It was still so far away, however, that it could not be identified.</p>

  <p class="normal">Evidently, the island had no paths through the jungle, which meant that there were few if any people here. Sloosh waded into a swamp, following the impressions visible only to him. The others followed, putting each foot down with dread. Snakes hissed at them and slid off branches or rocks into the stinking bubbling dark-green water. Swarms of insects attacked them. Froglike amphibians weighing perhaps fifty pounds leaped out from hummocks of mud and belly-crashed resoundingly. Then they dived, only to reappear close to the legs of the travelers. Their tongues flicked out and lacerated legs with tiny sharp barbs.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "They may hurt, but they can't be fatal. If they were, the Yawtl wouldn't have passed this way."</p>

  <p class="normal">The water got deeper. Aejip and Jum started swimming. Abruptly, the bottom sloped upward, and they were soon on higher land. Now they were beneath colossal trees under which little brush grew. They stopped to smear mud over their insect-bitten bodies and to rest. There was a strange silence under the branches, no buzz, hiss, caw, scream, chitter. A greenish-gray fungus clothed the lower trunks of the trees, a fluffy ill-smelling stuff two to three feet thick.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nobody spoke. Sloosh held a finger to the end of his beak to indicate quiet. After a while he gestured, and he started walking. They rose wearily, since it was past bedtime, and followed. In a short time they'd passed through the forest and emerged on the rim of a shallow valley. Its surface seemed to be covered mostly with sand and gigantic dark-blue boulders. Here and there were some lone trees or small copses.</p>

  <p class="normal">About a mile away, above the center of the valley, hovered the white object. It was restrained from floating away by a massive cable of some sort in its center and slimmer cables on its edges.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv spoke softly. "Three <i>tharakorm.</i> Tied together side by side."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh's gaze circled the area. "The Yawtl has been up on them. But he came down without the benefit of a ladder."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you mean?" Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He either jumped or was thrown off." He pointed. "He's out there now, somewhere behind that extraordinarily large rock."</p>

  <p class="normal">They went down the slope and onto the soft, very warm sand. They had not gone more than forty feet when Sloosh stopped, holding up a hand. They wondered why he'd done so, but his manner indicated that they keep silent.</p>

  <p class="normal">Presently, the sand began boiling. A little pit appeared, and two long tentacles, bilious green with narrow yellow stripes, slid out. They snaked around as if feeling for something. Sloosh gestured that they should back up. After about twenty paces, he stopped. They waited while the-tentacles slid out to a length of fifteen feet.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then, so suddenly that it caused them to jump back, a long curved barbed pole like a giant scorpion's sting shot out of the sand not ten feet ahead of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">A minute passed. As swiftly as it had appeared, the sting-pole slid back beneath the sand.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's strange," Sloosh buzzed softly. "It shouldn't be there. It's right in the Yawtl's trail."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you mean?" Deyv whispered.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can see the impressions of many creatures I've never encountered before. It's evident that they are under the ground. I suspected that they've been set there to catch the unwelcome. But the Yawtl's path curved here and there so much that it was evident he knew where they were. I followed his path so we, too, could avoid those sand-beasts.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But then I perceived one directly under the trail over which the Yawtl had gone. I also see the impressions of three humans around here. They've moved around freely. And it looks to me as if they've led the sand-beasts to other places."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why didn't you tell us this?" Deyv asked fiercely.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would have. In time. It wasn't necessary as long as we were on the safe path."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh looked at the side-by-side <i>tharakorm.</i> "Let's hope that their sleep-times correspond to ours. And that they don't keep a watch then. Otherwise, they've seen us. We will proceed as if they haven't. There is nothing else to do."</p>

  <p class="normal">He closed his eyes for a while. When he opened them, he said, "The Yawtl's impressions are still strong. I can't see their end, so I don't know if he's still living."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv understood this. He'd been told that when a creature died, it emitted a large yellow ball. No matter what colors its living impressions made, its decease was marked with yellow. Sometime later, the yellow ball would fade and eventually disappear.</p>

  <p class="normal">"A good thing, too," Sloosh had said. "If every impression didn't fade out, my vision would be so full of them, I'd never be able to untangle them. The world, to me, would be a nightmare of complexities."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh emitted a long rising and falling buzz, for him a sigh. "As before, single file. Step softly. And don't stray from the path."</p>

  <p class="normal">It took a long time. Sloosh zigzagged and even circled and once took them back only a hundred yards from their starting point. When they finally got close to the tremendous boulder, he stopped.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now be especially careful. There is a sand-beast on each side. If you panic and move too far to one side to avoid one, the other will get you."</p>

  <p class="normal">Aejip was directly in front of Vana, and Jum was just ahead of Deyv. Though extremely nervous, the two animals did just as Deyv ordered. The cat slunk along, looking quickly to each side. The dog's hair was bristling, but his bushy tail was high in the air. Every now and then he growled softly.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now the sand boiled at either hand, whirlpools formed, and tentacles shot out. They slid like snakes toward the ankles of the trespassers, stopping only a few inches from them. It was terrifying to walk between the two pairs of waving seeking tips, each ending in a long hooked claw. Deyv whispered soft encouragement to Jum, and Vana urged Aejip to stay immediately behind the Archkerri.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv sweated more in a minute than he had in most hours.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then they were out of danger.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh veered away from the boulder and approached it in a wide arc. When they got to its other side, they saw that a copse of trees was beyond it, about twenty yards away. Deyv thought that the Yawtl might be hiding in it. Sloosh, however, turned toward the base of the boulder. As Deyv neared it, he saw the rim of a large pit.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri stopped short of the edge and pointed downward.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There is the thief."</p>
