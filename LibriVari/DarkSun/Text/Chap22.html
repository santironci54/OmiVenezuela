  <h1>22</h1>

  <p class="normal">GREEDY Hoozisst had taken the Emerald and hung it from his neck, and then the captives' hands and feet had been tied. All but one had been put in a room whose open exit was a window to the outside. Hoozisst had told Sloosh how to control those chambers which had sliding doors. They used the little animal on the wall of Feersh's quarters to close the room in which the bound prisoners were kept. To make sure that the witch couldn't kill herself by getting out through a window, they enclosed her in a room without one. Since she would soon have died of oxygen-starvation, Sloosh punched a hole in the hull.</p>

  <p class="normal">All of Deyv's party except the Archkerri wanted to puncture the gas cells immediately. Sloosh, however, said that it would be too dangerous at this time. To convince them, he took them back up to the top deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Look at that peak on the horizon," he said. "Notice how fast it's going by, yet it must be a long way off. We must be traveling at least a hundred miles an <i>ukhromikhthanshukh."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">"What's that?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh had given the particular groups of buzzes corresponding to certain sounds in Vana's language. But the word was unknown to her.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri explained that the Earth rotated on its axis about once every 142.8 hours. An hour, that is, an ukhromikhthanshukh, was a unit of time. There were about thirteen of these between sleep-time and sleep-time, though that was not by any means exact. At one time the Earth had rotated on its axis once every twenty-four hours. At other times, it had not rotated at all, but this state had not lasted long, since the ancients of that time had set it back to spinning every twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p class="normal">The others still didn't at all understand what the word meant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is because you have a very feeble idea of time. You can't be blamed for that, since your technology and science are undeveloped."</p>

  <p class="normal">Stung, Deyv said, "You have much less sense of time than we do!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Not true. What I have is a lesser sense of urgency. Though it's much more developed now because of my association with you people. My people would be appalled if they knew how strong it was. Perhaps it would be better if all the Archkerri had this, however. A lack of that sense may explain, in part, why we are so few and you other sapients are, in comparison, so many."</p>

  <p class="normal">He closed his eyes, then opened them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let me put it this way. You remember when we crash-landed in that other <i>tharakorm?</i> We were going only about fifty miles an hour. We're going twice as fast now. If we land now, we'll be killed. The <i>tharakorm</i> probably wouldn't be damaged, but we'd be smashed to pulp. So, landing now is out."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But this storm might last a long time!" Vana said. "By the time we could land, we might be more than a thousand miles from our home!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"More like three thousand miles," Sloosh said. "It could even be six thousand or ten thousand. Who knows?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They were horrified. Tears ran down the cheeks of Vana and Deyv. The Yawtl didn't weep, but he looked as if he'd like to. Jum and Aejip didn't know what the cause of the grief was, but the dog whimpered, and the cat licked Vana's leg. Perhaps they thought that the approaching thunder and lightning were making their masters afraid.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a while the roar and crash and dazzling whiteness drove them belowdecks. Deyv had thought that they might as well question Feersh now, but he decided that it would be well near impossible. It was far too noisy. Every time a lightning bolt exploded nearby, he jumped and then shook. He wouldn't have the concentration that the interrogation would require.</p>

  <p class="normal">Even so, he regretted that he couldn't make her tell him where his soul egg was. It would be so soothing to hold it in his hand, to stroke it, to press it against his chest, to kiss it. It radiated comfort and courage, and by bending his thoughts around it, he could make the thunder and lightning seem remote, undangerous. At this time, he hated the witch more than he ever had. When the storm was over, he was going to make her reveal the hiding place of the eggs if he had to unravel her nerve by nerve.</p>

  <p class="normal">He huddled in an inner room, where Sloosh said they would have less chance of being struck by the lightning. His arm was around the dog, who pressed closely against him. Vana was embracing the cat. Sloosh stood in a corner, his eyes closed. He might have been asleep or thinking about something remote from human affairs or even his own. The Yawtl was nervous, but he had no one to cling to, so he had gone into an embryonic position. His knees were against his chest, his arms around his knees, his head bent to touch them. When a bolt ripped the air close by, he started as if he had awakened in his mother's womb, hearing the call to be born.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now and then Deyv managed to doze, only to be awakened trembling from sleep by a deafening and darkness-dispelling blast. He ate now and then, and when he had to relieve himself, he would go to the room where the witch was imprisoned. The others also did this to lower her morale. None of the captives were fed, though they were given water. If hunger weakened them, so much the better. They would have less resistance to the inquisition. And lying in their own excrement would make them more miserable.</p>

  <p class="normal">After an almost intolerable length of time, the black thunder and his white sisters went away. Observation from the top deck showed that the wind was still as strong. Moreover, they were just over a particularly mountainous region, and now the <i>tharakorm</i> dropped sickeningly in downdrafts or cannoned upward so suddenly that they momentarily floated. They had to go back to their room and lie down again.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh, who should have known better by now, insisted on telling the others what might happen.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The downdrafts could take us all the way to the ground. The updrafts could take us so high we'd pass out or even die from lack of oxygen. And we might be dashed against a mountainside."</p>

  <p class="normal">He couldn't understand why they told him to shut up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ignoring the facts or wishing to be ignorant of them is unrealistic. However, as you wish. So ... I won't irritate you by telling you about these mountains."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Good," Deyv said. After a while, though, he asked, "What about the mountains?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, curiosity is stronger than fear. These mountains are part of a mighty range that extends from one ocean-shore to the other. It bisects this land mass. It'll make our return on foot very difficult. But we can bypass if by making a boat and traveling along ,the shore. Of course, that isn't without its perils. There are tsunamis and giant carnivorous fish and sea-mammals and hostile sapients. It might be better to take the land route. But if we do, we'll take much more time for passage. Also, the quakes make the range very perilous. Landslides, the earth opening under us, all sorts of unpleasant events."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Shut up!" the others said in unison. The mountains fell behind, and the flight became more comfortable. The wind slackened considerably, though Sloosh estimated by a little less than half. The band of light on the horizon widened a trifle, causing Sloosh to remark that he had seriously underestimated the wind velocity.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It must have gotten up to one hundred fifty miles per hour at times, maybe even two hundred. In any event, we still can't take a chance on landing. However, the <i>tharakorm</i> haven't been fed since we took off, and eight sleep-times without food will result in some loss of the lifting gas. So, eventually, like it or not, we'll sink to the ground."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv regretted that they'd thrown the corpses overboard instead of feeding them to the ship-creatures.</p>

  <p class="normal">By then the stink of excrement and unwashed bodies was pervading the <i>tharakorm.</i> The captives were released, by couples, to clean up themselves and the floors. There was still enough drinking water to spare for washing the filthier parts of their bodies. Empty vases and bowls were set out to catch rainwater. So far, the food supply was sufficient. Even so, the captives were now fed only sparingly.</p>

  <p class="normal">After the tenth sleep-time, the wind began dropping. In the meantime, the <i>tharakorm</i> were thoroughly searched. Even the yardarms were examined. They could find none of their soul eggs or the Archkerri's crystal. It was time for the questioning.</p>

  <p class="normal">The slaves were tried first, though it was unlikely that they would know where the soul eggs were kept. Feersh and .her children were present at the sessions so they could witness—in the witch's case, hear—what was in store for them. The slaves were not tortured, since it wasn't worthwhile, but Deyv and his companions made plenty of references to their plans to do so.</p>

  <p class="normal">As expected, the slaves had no idea where Feersh had put the eggs. Even when they were threatened with being thrown out a window, they insisted on this. The Yawtl was all for heaving them out anyway, but Deyv and Vana felt that they might be useful later on. Sloosh said nothing about this. He either didn't care or had not yet considered the problem.</p>

  <p class="normal">Next, the two surviving sons of Feersh, Kiyt and Jeydee, and the daughter, Jowanarr, were worked upon. All three normally wore floor-length robes, but they'd been naked when captured and had remained so. They had no soul, eggs, since their original witch ancestors had been people whose eggs had "soured," as the saying went. Thus, they couldn't be threatened with the loss of these.</p>

  <p class="normal">However, their lack of clothes when outside their cabins did humiliate them and make them feel powerless. As the first step in the interrogation, the Yawti passed water all over their bodies. This was, in witch culture, a peculiarly insulting deed. The slaves must have enjoyed this, since they'd had to undergo the same treatment whenever Feersh's brood wished to punish them. They had difficulty suppressing their smiles.</p>

  <p class="normal">The slaves were then told to pummel the witch's children. They hesitated until Hoozisst said they'd be thrown out the window if they didn't obey. They must not beat them so severely, though, that they couldn't answer questions clearly. At first somewhat diffident, the slaves became enthusiastic after a while. The Yawtl called them off when he thought the three had had enough softening.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now," he said, "the hard part starts. I have in mind burning wooden splints under the fingernails first. If that doesn't work, I'll put burning wooden splints up your genitals. After that, I'll start getting tough."</p>

  <p class="normal">The sons began weeping and sobbing and moaning that they did not know where the eggs were. Their mother did know, but she would never take them into her confidence about them. Jowanarr said nothing, nor had she cried out when being beaten.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jeydee spoke out of a mouth which had lost half its teeth. "Mother, tell them! We cannot take this!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh stood in a corner, her hands tied behind her. She, top, was naked and no doubt very conscious of her ugly scrawny body and breasts, which sagged almost to her navel. The long narrow face with its bulging cheekbones and hairy upper lip was set as if it were a wax mask. The blind eyes stared straight ahead.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said, "It is a waste of time to give pain to these creatures. You might enjoy this, Yawtl, but I don't. I'm very sensitive to the pain of others. I can permit torture, if there is a rational reason for it, even if I too suffer, though not of course to the same degree as the tortured.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But my main objection is the uselessness of this. The witch isn't going to tell us anything which will keep her children from being hurt. She doesn't really care about them. She's spoiled them, kept them from maturing, not from love but because they'd be weak and easier to handle. Her eldest daughter has been raised somewhat more strictly because she will someday be the chief, and so she has a stronger character. However, Feersh isn't going to give in if you torture Jowanarr. In fact, she might even enjoy it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So, I suggest you tackle Feersh herself. Not with pain or threats. She's too tough for those. She—"</p>

  <p class="normal">For the first time, the witch spoke. "What is the plant-man saying?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst raised his thick tangled eyebrows as if he thought they might be making progress. He translated for her.</p>

  <p class="normal">She said, "What he says is true. You could kill me, and I still wouldn't cry out, let done tell you what you want to know. However, I wouldn't hesitate at all telling you where the eggs are hidden if I believed you'd not kill me. If I could think of some way to guarantee that we'd be freed once I told you, I'd do it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Kiyt cried out, "Mother! Why didn't you say this before? Why let us be degraded and beaten?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The witch smiled, revealing very yellow teeth. "I've been too soft with you. I thought that perhaps the ordeal might strengthen your character."</p>

  <p class="normal">His face twisted with anger, Kiyt spat blood at her. Then he stepped back as if he feared that she might strike him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh either didn't know that he was the one spitting or she was ignoring him. She said, "Vegetable-thing, can't we make a deal? One which you can enforce? I don't trust these savages."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vegetable-thing!" Sloosh said. "You don't arrange such matters by starting with an insult!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst translated for Feersh.</p>

  <p class="normal">She said, "I apologize—for the first time in my life. Actually, it wasn't an insult. I am a flesh-thing, and you are what I said. But since it offends you . . . Now, what about my proposal?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri closed his eyes. Except for the coughing of a slave and the muted groaning of the two sons, there was silence. Finally, he opened his eyes. "It's a reasonable suggestion. I think we should accept."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No!" Hoozisst shouted. "What about my revenge? Would you cheat me of that? We can have what is owing me and the eggs also!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Ah, but if revenge is in order," Sloosh said, "what about Vana's and Deyv's? You stole their eggs, and it was only with difficulty that I could keep them from torturing, and then killing you. The reason I could is that they needed you to help get the eggs back. The same logic applies here."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst was too angry to talk for a while. Then he said, "But I was under duress! I had to steal the eggs or I wouldn't have gotten the Emerald of Anticipation! Also, she would have killed me if I hadn't done what she wanted!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"She didn't tell you to rob me of my crystal," Sloosh said. "She didn't want that. Yet, you took it. Besides, all you had to do was promise her you'd steal the eggs and then run away. She could never have found you."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What? And be forever separated from my tribe?"</p>

  <p class="normal">" 'Forever' is not exact. It would have lasted only until you died. However, you do have a point there. Though it's not much."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl, scowling, stomped around for a moment, taking time to knock Kiyt down with his fist. He started toward the witch, but Sloosh said, "No, Hoozisst."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I smell a trick," the Yawtl said. "We'll give her our promise, and then we'll find out she'll tell us but we still won't have the eggs."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A good point," Sloosh said. "Tell Feersh that we don't just want the location of the eggs. We must be able to get our hands on them. It's possible that she's set traps around them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh listened to the translation. She said, "You tell the plant-man that I agree to those terms. But first we must be unbound. I give my word that we won't attack you if you don't attack us."</p>

  <p class="normal">"A witch's word!" Hoozisst said harshly.</p>

  <p class="normal">"As good as a Yawtl's," she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Which would mean no good at all," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst raised his fist and said, "Aargh!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Aejip rose to her feet and snarled. The Yawtl lowered his fist and backed away.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wasn't going to hit you. I wouldn't be that stupid. But I'm furious!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It doesn't take eyes to see that," the witch said. "Now, tell the plant-man that I'll cooperate to the fullest, that I'll withhold nothing, so that you may get your eggs and his crystal back."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "You must also tell us why you wanted them."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'll be very happy to do that. In fact, if you hadn't attacked us, if you'd only gotten as far as the place beneath the <i>tharakorm,</i> I'd have told you why. I never dreamed that you'd have a plant-man in your group. One of the reasons I threw the Yawtl overboard was that he'd disobeyed me. I hadn't told him to steal an Archkerri's crystal. I had no use for one.</p>

  <p class="normal">"But I never suspected that the plant-man would follow the Yawtl. If I had, I'd not have been so negligent. I'd have had sentinels. I knew that the cable-vines wouldn't give an alarm if a plant-man touched them. But who would have thought that one of those creatures would <i>care</i> if his crystal was stolen?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh also asked that she and her children be robed at once. It wasn't proper for them to appear before their slaves without clothing, except when these were in bed with them or bathing them, of course.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh said that that was all right with him. Hoozisst objected to any agreement. He still believed that the witch was somehow tricking them. The others overruled him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Feersh, now clad in a robe covered with many strange figures and a few of The Dark Beast and wearing a tall blue cylindrical hat, said that she was ready to give them their information. But she wanted them to reaffirm that they would do nothing to her once they got it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That doesn't need repeating," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst groaned and said, "She must have a good-reason for making sure of thatl I tell you, she's playing us for fools!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I can't do anything that the goddesses haven't already done," she said.</p>

  <p class="normal">She paused, licked dry lips, then spoke. "Very well. Your eggs and crystal are embedded inside one of the fungus growths at the base of a tree in the forest that rings the sandy plain around the place where the <i>tharakorm</i> were moored. In fact, from what you tell me, you camped by that tree."</p>
