  <h1>19</h1>

  <p class="normal">DEYV whirled, tense, hoping nobody had heard the crack of weapon against bone. Sometime later the faint splop of a body smashing into earth reached him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv went back to the hole quietly, pausing to listen at a cabin window. There wasn't a sound. Sloosh came up shortly after, breathing heavily through his chest-mouth. Deyv helped him up, unloaded the cube, and untied Aejip. The cat bounded onto the deck, grimacing soundlessly. Deyv patted and stroked her to soothe her and whispered that she should stay there until Vana came. It had been agreed beforehand that the woman would be Aejip's partner during the attack.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl came next, toiling upward with Jum bound to his back. Deyv also petted and quieted him. Vana boarded close behind Hoozisst. Deyv told them what he'd observed and that he'd killed a man.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I thought I saw something falling through the dark," the Yawtl said. "I was afraid it was you. But when I heard no alarm, I knew that it must have been one of them. If he came from that cabin, he was one of Feersh's sons. I hope it wasn't Skibroziy. I want him to suffer much before he dies."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst had described in detail the layout of the rooms and corridors of the ship-creatures. Feersh slept in a chamber on the lower deck. Sometimes, she was alone; sometimes, with a male slave. Jowanarr spent her sleep-time in the aft cabin with two or three slaves, male and female. Seelgee was in the cabin nearest the bow. Kiyt was in a cabin near his mother's. Jeydee and Skibroziy were usually in the middle cabin, either by themselves or with a couple of male or female slaves. Hoozisst had also described the sons and daughters so that they wouldn't be confused with the slaves.</p>

  <p class="normal">The only way to get belowdecks was to go through the cabins—unless you were a <i>khratikl.</i> The plan was to seize Feersh as a hostage. Hoozisst had said that he believed they would be safe as long as they had her in their power. The others would do what she said—he hoped. Of course, there was the possibility that Jowanarr, who no doubt was impatient to be the chief, might let her mother be killed.</p>

  <p class="normal">The raiders went behind the central cabin, where Vana passed around torches she'd brought up on her back. Using the cabin and a fiber sheet, found on the deck, as protection from the wind, they lit the torches. First, they poured out from a gourd some fish-oil they'd prepared. Then the Yawtl used his iron and flint to rain sparks on the oil. After a few failures, it finally lit. He poured more oil on the blaze, and they took turns dipping the ends of their fish-oil-soaked torches in the fire.</p>

  <p class="normal">Just as the third torch was set to burning, they heard a scream to their right. They spun toward the sound but could see nothing. A moment later, a furious shrieking <i>khratikl</i> swept at them from the darkness. Its leathery wings beat at Deyv, and its claws ripped into his face. Shouting with pain, he dropped his torch and grabbed the stinking loathsome thing and threw it on the deck. Before it could rise, it was tomahawked by the Yawtl.</p>

  <p class="normal">It was too late to carry out their original plan. They'd intended to split up the party so all three cabins could be invaded at once. Now they had to get inside the central cabin at once. Somewhere something metallic was being struck, its deep bongs vibrating through the air. And from the <i>tharakorm</i> housing the <i>khratikl</i> came many screams of rage.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst, holding his torch in one hand, opened the door to the central cabin with the other. He snatched his tomahawk from his belt and, yelling, charged inside. Vana followed, the now roaring cat close behind her. Deyv picked his torch up, felt the blood streaming down his face, grimaced at the pain, and, sword in hand, bounded after the others. The dog, growling, leaped after him. The plant-man, the slowest, had been chosen to form the rearguard.</p>

  <p class="normal">The cabin was made of a heavy wood stained a brown-reddish color and painted with horizontal bands of yellow and green. Spears, blowguns, tomahawks, war clubs, and one of the ancient metal swords hung on the walls. Two corners held beds, wide, mattressed, and covered with some beautiful cloth Deyv had never seen before. There was a chest of drawers and two stands with washbowls, and soap, towels, and bottles of some dark-green substance.</p>

  <p class="normal">In the middle of the room was a table of glossy hardwood which held a base on which was a large ball of quartz. It pulsed with a fierce orange glow that made the torches unnecessary. It struck Deyv with astonishment, since it had not been on fire until a moment before. Jowanarr must have summoned the light through witchery.</p>

  <p class="normal">A man, a well-built slave with dark-brown skin and wavy hair dyed green and yellow, lay face down on the floor. Blood spread out from under him. On the bed by him sat a naked woman, Jowanarr. Her hands were clutching her chest and under her dark skin was a paleness. She was long-legged and slim but had huge breasts and a long narrow face, a long hooked nose, and dark eyes great with terror.</p>

  <p class="normal">On the other bed sprawled another male slave, Vana's short spear sticking out of his throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">Jowanarr, seeing Deyv's bloody face, started to stand up. Aejip and Jum snarled at her, and she sat back down.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv went past the table with the glowing, quartz sphere and removed a square trap, door by its metal ring. The opening revealed a dark well from which descended a flight of wooden steps that had been placed over the steep ramp grown by the <i>tharakorm.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">He looked up. Vana was pulling on the spear caught in the slave's windpipe.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Forget that!" he said. "Take that sword off the wall!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl beat her to it. Swinging the blade around over his head, he whooped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv had no time to be disgusted with Hoozisst's greediness. He could handle the sword better than Vana anyway, being the stronger. She shot out her tongue at him, an expression of contempt in her tribe, and turned around to withdraw the spear.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh had closed the door behind him. A good thing, too, for immediately thereafter paws pounded on it, claws scratched, and screeching filled the cabin. Ratlike faces looked through the windows, followed shortly by bodies. Aejip flew along the walls, raking the faces with her claws. Jum leaped up and bit down on others. Vana thrust her spear into a dripping mouth.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell the witch's daughter to order them to stay out!" Deyv whistled at the Yawtl in Archkerri.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl spat words at Jowanarr. She hesitated, but when Hoozisst, his sword raised, stepped toward her, she screamed out at the beasts. They ceased trying to get through the windows, though their din filled the cabin.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv grabbed the woman's hand and yanked her off the bed. He pulled her to the opening in the floor and thrust her down ahead of him. She fell down the wooden stairs but would have been up on her feet and down a corridor if he hadn't leaped down on top of her. Her head hit the floor, and she passed out. He hoped he hadn't killed her, since he might need her later.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana came down swiftly, followed by the two animals. Hoozisst took the steps two at a time, surrounded by light. He'd abandoned his torch for the glowing quartz sphere.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It makes a much better light," he said, grinning. "Besides, I want to make sure nobody else grabs it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv didn't wait for the Archkerri to make his ponderous way down the steps. He raced ahead toward where the Yawtl had said the witch slept. Open entrances, dark, silent, flashed past. The doorway to Feersh's room was about ten feet away when he slammed headlong into a wall that shot out of a recess. He fell back onto the floor, the sword and the torch fallen from his suddenly limp hands. For a moment he didn't know what had happened. Added to the flow of blood from the claw wounds was blood from his nose.</p>

  <p class="normal">He rose shakily and picked up the torch. The wall had slid out or dropped down from hollows within the corridor walls. It had come out so swiftly he hadn't even been aware of it. Nor had he heard it thud into the floor.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned, automatically picking up the sword. Ten feet behind him another wall barred his passage. He was trapped.</p>

  <p class="normal">Someone was hammering on that wall. He strode to it and shouted. Silence rolled through the chamber. He put his mouth as close as he could to the very tough but very thin material and yelled, "It's I, Deyv! Who's there?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Putting his ear against the wall, he heard, "Quiet, Jum, Aejip!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Now he could distinguish the low growlings of the animals.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Vana! I'm caught between two walls. Where are the others?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Hoozisst has gone down another corridor. He'll then go down the one which runs alongside the hull and see if he can get to the witch's room from its other end."</p>

  <p class="normal">"She wouldn't leave that side open—I think," Deyv yelled back. "Where's Sloosh?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"He's holding off the <i>khratikl</i> in the room below the entrance."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv managed to shove down the panic that was growing like yeast in a pot, pushing up the lid of his self-control. The air in this chamber would last only so long, and any energetic action would bum it up that much faster. He knew that Feersh wouldn't want to trap herself, so she must have an escape route. It wouldn't be through the bottom of the hull because she'd have to have a huge windlass to let herself down on a rope-ladder to the ground. Besides, she wouldn't abandon the tharakorm and so be at the mercy of enemies who might be below.</p>

  <p class="normal">This was the lower deck. At this point the hull curved inward, like the hull of a canoe. This level had no direct contact with the hull of the neighboring <i>thardkorm.</i> But there probably was a window through which Feersh could put a plank so that she could then cross over to the adjacent ship-creature. She might already be in it. Or she might be waiting to see what happened.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv told Vana his speculations. Then he said, "I'm going to cut through the hull—if I can—and find out if she's gone across. That'll give me air, too. I only hope that the hull isn't as tough as the walls guarding the gas cells."</p>

  <p class="normal">"But even if you find that out," Vana called, "what good will it do? You won't be able to follow her."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I told you I have to have air. And for all I know, there is more than one wall between her door and this wall."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana shouted, "Sloosh is having trouble. I have to go. I'll be back soon, if I'm able."</p>

  <p class="normal">He listened but could hear nothing. He called to her and got no reply. Shrugging, he turned and began punching at the hull with the point of his sword. It was hard work, the stuff resisting over fifty punches before the tip of the blade went through. He would have liked to quench his torch because it was burning up the oxygen so swiftly. But he had to see so he could hit the same spot each time. Besides, there was nothing with which he could put the flame out. When it did go out, it would have used up all the air, and he'd be dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">By the time he made a small slit, he was sweating heavily, his arms were getting numb, and his senses were fading. He lengthened the incision a trifle, then inserted his blade, and with a mighty effort—relatively mighty, anyway—bent the edges of the cut outward. He put his nose to the hole and breathed in. Fresh air greeted him. He managed to smile, he was so relieved. There could have been an inner wall to the hull, and if there had been, he soon would have been dead.</p>

  <p class="normal">His strength regained, he worked until he'd made a hole big enough to put his head through. Above him was much noise, men and women screaming and yelling, <i>khratikl</i> screeching and cluttering. To his right he could see a large opening in the hull. The witch could have gotten through that, but there was nothing bridging the gap. However, Feersh wouldn't have left the plank there so she could be followed.</p>

  <p class="normal">He turned to batter at the wall through which he'd spoken to Vana. Suddenly it shot up into its slot, startling him and leaving him with a knocking heart.</p>

  <p class="normal">Behind him the Yawtl said, "I thought you might be dead by now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst, holding the glowing sphere, was standing just beyond where the other wall had been. He was grinning as if he'd played a big joke on somebody. Sweat plastered his long reddish hairs to his body.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I cut through the wall barring my way," he said, "and I got to the witch's quarters. She was gone from there, but I saw the edge of a board on the rim of the window of the <i>tharakorm</i> opposite. I looked around, and I found the control which operates the traps. It's a strange little animal which seems to be glued to the wall. It—"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Never mind that," Deyv said. "Follow me!"</p>

  <p class="normal">He ran down the corridor toward the uproar, holding the torch in his left hand. He found Sloosh standing near the bottom of the steps, gesturing at the small remnant of survivors with his torch. Bodies lay around him, <i>khratikl</i> battered with his club and burned with his brand. Vana and the two animals were not in sight.</p>

  <p class="normal">Seeing the two newcomers, the <i>khratikl</i> fled back up the steps.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv, panting, said, "Where's—?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Down the corridor," Sloosh buzzed. "She thinks the slaves and Feersh's children are waiting above to get us when we come back up. They aren't capable of much action on their own. They depend upon the witch too much for orders. Which is a weakness we must take advantage of. I presume the witch escaped, otherwise you'd have told me differently."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv nodded. Above them, ringing the opening, were the pointed faces and bright-yellow eyes of the <i>khratikl.</i> The steps were smeared with blood from the wounded who had fled up them. The Archkerri had lost some of his leaves and others were torn. His skin was pink but looked thick. No veins were visible.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv said, "Feersh should be up there by now organizing the humans and <i>khratikl.</i> We must've killed half of their beasts, though, and I doubt that the slaves will fight well."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's right," Hoozisst said, great contempt in his voice. "Slaves don't make good warriors. Not unless they're fighting against their masters."</p>

  <p class="normal">A high harsh voice reached them. They looked up to glimpse a narrow bony face with a gray topknot of hair. The Emerald, an egg-sized stone, dangled from a cord around her neck. The face shot away, and the <i>khratikl</i> by it also disappeared. A moment later, the trap door slid out to cover almost the entire opening. A thick dark fluid began flowing down the steps. It had an acrid odor.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl said, "She's going to smoke us out!"</p>
