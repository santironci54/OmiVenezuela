  <h1>17</h1>

  <p class="normal">AT first, Deyv thought that the Yawtl had been seized by a sand-beast and dragged into the pit. There was no evidence of a struggle, though. It was also doubtful that the Yawtl could have resisted for very long anything so monstrous. Whatever had happened, he was injured and in pain. Nevertheless, the reddish eyes glared challengingly at them. He tried to raise himself and to lift the rock gripped in one of his hands. He grimaced and fell back.</p>

  <p class="normal">Though he was naked, his loincloth having somehow been lost, he had managed to retain the bone whistle. Sloosh pointed his beak down at him and said in Archkerri, "We are not here to kill you, Hoozisst. All we want is the recovery of the eggs and my crystal."</p>

  <p class="normal">Once more, Sloosh had flabbergasted Deyv. Deyv said, "You <i>know</i> him?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes. I met him a long time ago when he visited us with some others of his kind. How else would he know our language?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You knew it was him all the time? Why didn't you say so?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"It was his theft, not his identity, that concerned me."</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana, her face twisted, said, "I swear, I swear, I'm going to kick you so hard all your leaves will fall off!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"If it will help your infantile emotional state, go ahead. However, you'll only hurt your foot."</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl said, "If you don't mean to kill me or torture me, then quit standing there talking. Get down here and get me out. I have a broken arm, my pelvis feels as if it's fractured, I've bled a lot, and I'm very thirsty and hungry."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where are the eggs?" Deyv whistled.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Tell me, or I'll tear your heart out!" Vana whistled.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl's thin lips opened in a very malicious smile, revealing the teeth of a carnivore. Then he closed his mouth and put the whistle to it. "They're up there. On the ship-creatures. Feersh the Blind has them. Help me, and I'll help you. I want my own egg, and even more I want <i>revenge."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">The two humans went down into the pit and carried him back up between them. When he was let down on the edge, he said, "They're all sleeping now, or should be. Let's hope so; otherwise we're done for. Get me back to the forest, and I'll tell you my story. You Can't do anything without knowing it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That seems sensible," Sloosh said. "Put him on my back."</p>

  <p class="normal">They had to endure the ordeal of the tentacles again, but otherwise the return was much less frightening than the original venture. Once within the shelter of the trees, they gave Hoozisst what he wanted. They set his arm and put it in a splint. Vana brought water to bathe the bruises and lacerations. Deyv threw his spear up among the tree branches and knocked off many of the large purplish pear-shaped fruit. The Yawtl devoured a dozen of these with such pleasure that the others decided to eat some with him. Deyv thought they were the most delicious fruit he'd ever tasted.</p>

  <p class="normal">When the Yawtl's needs had been fulfilled, he closed his eyes. No one bothered him until he opened them a long time later. They understood that he had to probe his body with his mind to locate every cell that needed repair. Having done this, he could then direct the healing substances to those parts. He could also fix the rate of speed at which the healing would be done. There was an upper limit to this, but the procedure was considerably faster than the natural process. However, the degree of speed depended upon the amount of food and water ingested. Which meant that since Hoozisst had to get well soon, he would require much sustenance. Which meant that his captors were going to be busy providing him with all his belly could hold.</p>

  <p class="normal">The probing and directions would take about half an hour if he was as skillful in technique as the two humans, and he was. Then he would sleep for a while and wake up ravenous.</p>

  <p class="normal">The animals curled up and went to sleep. Sloosh and the humans would have liked to join them, but they had to find fuel for the Yawtls racing metabolism. Deyv and Vana speared two of the froggish beasts. The Archkerri tore out a young tree, trimmed it with Vana's tomahawk, and used its end to knock off more fruit. Then the vehicle was opened, and they carried Hoozisst into it.</p>

  <p class="normal">Between eating and sleeping, the Yawtl talked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Feersh the Blind is a wicked old witch."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh, interrupting, said, "By 'witch' he doesn't mean one who practices magic. Such a being exists only in the minds of the ignorant and superstitious. He means one who has found artifacts of the ancients and has discovered how to use them."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst looked annoyed. "Like most of her kind, she is tribeless. She lives with her family, some human slaves, and some <i>beezee</i> (or <i>khratikl),</i> whom she's raised from cubhood.</p>

  <p class="normal">"My tribe has had some contact with her, since her sons and daughters occasionally visit our village. We give them smoked meat and other goods. In return, she doesn't use her powers to do us evil. This burns us, but we can do nothing about it. Anyway, when one of her sons, Skibroziy, came to our village, he "drew me aside and ordered me to come with him to see his mother. I asked him why she wanted me. He replied, in that sneering imperious manner we Yawtl have to endure, that she would tell me why when she saw me.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was afraid. I've no shame admitting that. But I went. Besides, I thought there might be some profit in it for me. After all, I'd done nothing to offend Feersh. Skibroziy and I traveled through the jungle—our village is only three sleep-times away—and he guided me through the sand trap, and we climbed the ladder which hangs down from the central part of the three ship-creatures.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Feersh sat me down and gave me the best food and drink. Then she said she'd picked me to run an errand for her. Some <i>errand!</i> She had heard that I was the bravest, most cunning, and stealthiest thief of all the six tribes of this area. Thus, I was the best candidate to do what she wanted.</p>

  <p class="normal">"She demanded that I go out, no matter how far or how long it took me, and steal soul eggs. Not just anybody's. They had to indicate a certain type of character. She described the character of the owners, and she also described, in minute detail, how the eggs would indicate this.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I didn't like leaving my tribe for a long time, nor did I care for the unknown dangers I might run into. On the other hand, I was flattered because she'd chosen me. I wasn't going to do it for nothing, though. So I asked her what reward I would get for my time and perilous labors. To my surprise, she replied that I could have whatever I wanted from a group of rare or unique treasures of the ancients. She took me to where they lay on the deck and asked me to pick one. I finally did so after some agonizing and chose the Emerald of Anticipation. I'll tell you what it is later.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I was somewhat suspicious and didn't really believe her promise. But I thought that if she went back on it, I'd steal the Emerald from her. That shows you how valuable it was, that I would think of doing that when I was so scared of her powers. Though I must admit that there isn't a Yawtl around here who hasn't dreamed of stealing from Feersh. We all lacked the guts to try it, though.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So I went out, and the first egg I stole was from the Riverpig Tribe. I wouldn't steal from my own tribe unless it was absolutely necessary. Anyway, mine had no eggs like those she wanted. Except for my own egg. Which, as you see, she now has. I found two more in other Yawtl tribes, and then I had to go to the human and Tsimmanbul villages and Houses."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv asked, "What's a Tsimmanbul?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"A sapient species descended from an animal that once lived in the ocean," Sloosh said. "They didn't evolve naturally from their flippered state into land-dwelling bipeds. The ancients used their powers to change them into these. But their intelligence was equal to that of humans."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think I must sleep now," Hoozisst said.</p>

  <p class="normal">This irritated and frustrated his listeners, and he probably enjoyed their reactions.</p>

  <p class="normal">When Deyv relieved Vana from guard duty, he stationed himself on the edge of the forest. Standing there facing the sand traps, he thought that if it hadn't been for his missing egg and the nearness of Feersh the Blind, he could enjoy being there. For some reason which the Yawtl didn't know, this thin circle of woods was free of insects. Moreover, the animals, safe or dangerous, avoided it. If this was because Feersh had cast a spell on it, the magic hadn't influenced Jum and Aejip. They seemed at ease. The hunting in the swamp and the fishing in the river beyond the forest were as good as could be asked for.</p>

  <p class="normal">He fantasized the Earth as a place where such forests were interspersed among the jungles he knew. After the necessary hunting, a man could retreat to such a forest and "enjoy life without the dangers" of predators and the vexatious and sometimes painful or fatal insect and snake bites.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was, however, a realist. Into his thoughts of the paradise of such forests crawled visions of humans. There would be bachelors who'd sneak in and kill, or a raid by warriors fixed on wiping out Deyv and his tribe. And there would be bothersome and sometimes infuriating interferences by parents and other relatives, not to mention the shaman and his wife or friends. And there would be a wife who would too often want her own way. And ...</p>

  <p class="normal">But this was normal human life and, whatever its vexations, it was overall enjoyable, rewarding, and fulfilling. This was the only way open to a man if he was to be a completely rounded human.</p>

  <p class="normal">So, counting all the advantages and disadvantages, there would be no better place than a forest like this.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv couldn't see the humans aboard the <i>tharakorm.</i> But at least fifty leathery-winged ratlike <i>khratikl were</i> out feeding the sand monsters. They flew in couples which carried between each member a large chunk of raw meat. When they came above the places where the beasts hid, they dropped the flesh and flapped off for the jungle beyond the ship-creatures. The Yawtl had said that there were corrals there where cattle were raised. These were tended by <i>khratikl</i> supervised by human slaves. They provided food for the sand things, the slaves, the <i>khratikl,</i> Feersh's family, and the captive <i>tharakorm.</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv, watching the tentacles crawl out to seize the meat or giant stings readying to pierce it, thought that the feeding was a flaw in the idea of the sand traps. An observer in the forest could note the location of the <i>shishvenomi,</i> as Hoozisst called the sand-beasts, and then avoid the traps. But he'd have to have a good memory.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst had also told them that the <i>shishvenomi</i> didn't need food very often. They went into a semi-hibernation until their sensors detected vibrations on the surface. Then they became fully awake, only to fall back into their sleep after eating or if their prey eluded them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv had asked why the slaves didn't try to escape.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They have a fairly good life," Hoozisst had said. "And they're descendants of slaves. Feersh's great-great-grandmother captured their ancestors. In fact, they worship Feersh as a goddess. They also sacrifice to her. When the population gets too large, they reduce it by killing the useless old people and the babies who don't have matching soul eggs."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was indifferent to the babies' fate, since his own tribe had the same custom. But he was horrified by what happened to the old people. "Those slaves are beasts! They deserve to be slaves!"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl had smiled but had not replied.</p>

  <p class="normal">Now, watching the <i>khratikl,</i> Deyv didn't feel as repulsed or as indignant. It seemed to him that perhaps Feersh had done the right thing. After all, if the slaves got too numerous, they'd starve. And they couldn't just drive the old ones into the jungle to fend for themselves. It really was better, more humane, that they be spared that horror.</p>

  <p class="normal">Perhaps he'd misjudged the witch. Could anyone who'd prepared a forest like this, such a delightful place, be wicked? It didn't seem likely. And if she wasn't a witch but was a good-magic person, then perhaps her motive in stealing the soul eggs was good. She may have intended, and probably did, some benefit for those who had been robbed. However, since they wouldn't have voluntarily come to her with their eggs because of her bad reputation—no doubt the result of lies by her enemies—she'd sent the Yawtl to steal the eggs. Thus, the robbed would have to track him down and follow him to Feersh. And she would then explain just why she'd done this thing that had seemed so terrible to them only because of their ignorance of her true motive.</p>

  <p class="normal">Hadn't the Yawtl said that he took care that those pursuing him didn't lose the trail? If he'd not left much physical evidence of his passage for Deyv's party, it was because he knew Sloosh was in it. Contrary to what the plant-man had stated, Hoozisst was well aware of Sloosh's ability to see psychic tracks. Deyv couldn't actually define what connection this had with his growing belief that Feersh meant them no harm. But he was sure that it strengthened his reasoning about her.</p>

  <p class="normal">He didn't understand why Feersh had placed the dangerous <i>shishvenomi</i> in ambush. That certainly wasn't friendly. But then she could have excellent reasons for it. Maybe she had to have some test to weed out unfit candidates for whatever benefits she would bestow. Deyv's party had proved itself worthy.</p>

  <p class="normal">Since they'd come this far, and since the goal was in sight, why not just come out of hiding and show themselves?</p>

  <p class="normal">So thought, so done. Almost, anyway. He had to talk to his colleagues and find out if they agreed or disagreed. If they should disagree, though it. didn't seem likely, since Deyv's logic was irresistible, then he'd act on his own. But he owed it to them to discuss this with them first</p>

  <p class="normal">He was pleasantly surprised when the Yawtl said that he'd been thinking along the same lines. Hoozisst was up and about, his broken arm almost entirely knit, his bruises and contusions gone.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Let's see what the plant-man thinks."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where's Vana?" Deyv asked. "We should talk to her at the same time and so save time."</p>

  <p class="normal">"She went hunting with Aejip."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv felt a little angry.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Why should she want to do that? We don't need meat any more. The purple fruit is more than enough to eat. It's all we need."</p>

  <p class="normal">Hoozisst nodded. "That's what I was thinking. Why go out into that swamp with all its stinging insects and poisonous snakes and only Khrukhrukhru knows what else? She was inclined to agree, but the cat was hungry and wanted Vana to go with her. She's very fond of Vana, isn't she?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Yawtl had needled Deyv before about this. Deyv, however, no longer felt pangs of jealousy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"There's no reasoning with a cat. She'd bug Vana until she got her way, and Vana knows that. Well, we can talk to her when she gets back. There's no hurry."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh was stuffing the purplish fruit into the chest-mouth when they came up to him. His eyes were closed, his brain seemingly orbiting, or perhaps entangled with, some philosophical problem.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was mistaken. Sloosh had been engaged with the same subject as the others. His logic was similar, too.</p>

  <p class="normal">"As soon as Vana gets back, we'll tell her what we're going to do. I'm sure she'll agree with us. If she doesn't, then we'll leave her here. After a while, she'll follow us. What else can she do?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They strapped the folded-up vessel onto the plant-man's back and then ate some more of the fruit. It didn't sate or cloy but seemed to get more delicious with each bite. The time passed pleasantly as they talked idly of many things. They noted that The Dark Beast would soon be covering this part of the sky. They'd planned to cross the sand traps when the semi-darkness would make their passage much less visible from the <i>tharakorm.</i> Now they wouldn't wait.</p>

  <p class="normal">Presently, they heard Vana calling loudly, and they walked slowly to the edge of the forest facing the swamp. Here she came, splashing through the dark stinking waters, blood upon her arm and the tip of her spear. Behind her swam a dozen or so sleek greenish creatures about two feet long. They had weasellike heads with long thick whiskers and large blue eyes.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Anything wrong?" Deyv called out.</p>

  <p class="normal">" <i>'Anything wrong?' "</i> she screamed. "This is no time for your twisted sense of humor!"</p>

  <p class="normal">She left the swamp and ran up the gently sloping bank and into the trees. There she sat down, panting. The beasts followed her a minute later, clucking, their sharp teeth exposed in wicked grins. But they stopped when they came within a few feet of the edge of the forest. Some sat up on their hind legs and waved broad paws with webbed toes.</p>

  <p class="normal">Having regained her breath, Vana stood up. The blood on her arm was flowing heavily. Deyv suggested that she stanch the wound with mud.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What's the matter with you?" she cried. "You're all acting as if you didn't care that I could've been killed and that Aejip is treed by those beasts. I killed six with my darts and two with my spear. They could have caught me when I was in the water, but they were so busy eating their own dead that they let me get ahead of them. As it was—!"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Well, you're safe now," Deyv said. "But I suppose we'll have to rescue Aejip."</p>

  <p class="normal">" <i>'Suppose'!"</i> she cried. "What's the matter with you, Deyv? What's wrong with all of you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Nothing at all," he said. "We feel really fine."</p>

  <p class="normal">He proceeded to tell her what he and the others planned to do.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana heard them out with increasing incredulity. She didn't, however, say anything until after she'd smeared mud on her wound.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Do you know, I'd been feeling somewhat the way you have. Not nearly to that degree, though. Still, I was wondering this morning if perhaps we weren't mistaken about Feersh. But when I went with Aejip I got too busy to think about anything but hunting."</p>

  <p class="normal">She paused to look at them.</p>

  <p class="normal">"You're all eating that fruit. Standing there munching away and looking blissful. You aren't bothered by what happened and yet you should all be excited, ready to drive those beasts away and save Aejip. For all you know, she could be dead by now. Those beasts can climb trees, you know."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv began to feel just a little uneasy.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What're you thinking?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Narrow-eyed, Vana stared closely into his eyes. Then she looked into Hoozisst's and Sloosh's.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Yes, they seem a little glazed. I'd be in the same drugged condition if I hadn't gone hunting and gotten rid of some of its effects. That has to be it."</p>

  <p class="normal">"What do you mean?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's that fruit! It's making us think this crazy way! I'll bet that Feersh planted these trees here. She did it so that if people hid here to spy on her, they'd eat the purple stuff and it would affect their minds."</p>

  <p class="normal">The three males looked at each other. Deyv and Hoozisst burst out laughing. The plant-man buzzed his equivalent of loud scornful mirth.</p>

  <p class="normal">Her face flushed and angry, Vana said, "You lamebrains! You can't see I'm telling the truth because you're drugged!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed his equivalent of "Tut, tut!" Then he said, "Even if we were, why should we decide that Feersh wasn't dangerous? You're surely not saying that the fruits contain mental suggestions implanted somehow by the witch? That'd be a scientific impossibility."</p>

  <p class="normal">"No, but the fruit might affect you so that you'd want to take the easy way out, no matter how foolish it might be. Look at you now! You're not the least bit worried about my wound or the cat!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh spoke even more slowly than usual. "I think you're quite mistaken. However, there is only one way to determine if you are. I'm loath to take that course, since it means giving up the eating of this superb fruit. It also entails a considerable output of energy, which, frankly, I don't feel up to just now. But if it's to be done, we should do it now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Hoozisst didn't want to venture out into the swamp. The plant-man said that he sympathized with their feelings, but logic demanded that they test Vana's theory. They armed themselves and went out to meet the greenish beasts. Sloosh carried a big dead branch, the first time Deyv had seen him bear a weapon. The Yawtl and Vana shot darts with their blowguns; Deyv slashed with his sword. Within a few minutes, the predators were dead or fleeing.</p>

  <p class="normal">They sloshed through the water and the mud, Vana leading. When they arrived at the tree up which Aejip had fled, they found some dead or dying beasts at its foot. Aejip was also there, eating one. She was bleeding lightly where claws had raked her, but evidently she'd not been bitten.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they returned to the forest, Vana said, "If I catch anybody eating that fruit, I'll knock his skull in."</p>

  <p class="normal">"That would be a rather excessive measure," Sloosh said. "Or are you exaggerating again?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"You should know by now."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh buzzed the equivalent of a sigh. "Ah, the hyperbole of humans. Why can't you be exact in your speech?"</p>
