  <h1>14</h1>

  <p class="normal">THE trail left the river near the foot of the Brobdingnagian stone, where the waters fell in roaring sheets. They followed it into the forest until they came to a very narrow, very deep canyon. This gave them rough access to the other side of the mountain. There they were confronted by another valley, but it was much wider than the one they'd left. Much of it was occupied by a large lake, the other side of which was too distant to be seen. Several miles from the shore was an island. It seemed to consist mostly of steep-sided hills centered around a peak perhaps three thousand feet high. Small black clouds circled around and over the island, settled down on it, or suddenly ascended from it.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Flocks of birds," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the top of the peak something whitish and fluid flowed out, running down the sides in great streaks.</p>

  <p class="normal">A tiny white object floated up from the foothills of the island and was swept with the wind from the end of the valley. It rose higher and higher, gleaming, then was lost. It was headed toward the other end of the valley, where it could exit between two peaks.</p>

  <p class="normal">Near the travelers was the freshly cut stump of another <i>iyvrat</i> tree, severed branches, and chips.</p>

  <p class="normal">"He went to that island," Sloosh said. "Whether or not he got there, I can't tell. But he did get near his goal."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh's doubt was caused by the monstrous fish that now and then surfaced or dived back into the water. They looked big enough to swallow a war canoe of twenty men without straining themselves.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We could go around the lake and pick up his trail on the other side," Deyv said. "That would put us far, far behind him, though."</p>

  <p class="normal">"We wouldn't find his trail there," the Archkerri said. "The crafty creature intends to get aboard a young <i>tharakorm</i> and sail off with it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Vana asked him what he meant.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That island must be a breeding grounds for the <i>tharakorm.</i> 'Breeding' is not the correct term, though, since the <i>tharakorm</i> are not animals. You remember my description of 'the tiny invisible-to-the-eye creatures called bacteria and viri? Those white streams from the top of the peak are the overflow from a great mass of viri continually duplicating itself. The mass lies in a hollow within the top, and it draws those birds you see circling around within the peak and onto the sides. It does this by emitting a powerful perfume, clouds of molecules which entice the birds.</p>

  <p class="normal">"As you know, I have no sense of smell, unlike you humans. That is one sense you're up on me, though of course I'm compensated by my greater intelligence, not to mention other senses.</p>

  <p class="normal">"However, we can observe these molecular masses, which draw the birds as if they were tied to strings. The birds eat the boiling pulsing mass of viri, and they die shortly thereafter. They continue to flock in by the thousands, though they see their fellows die. The dead are used as food by the viri to duplicate themselves. Hence, the continual ferment and flow of the viri down the mountainside."</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't smell anything unusual," Vana said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That is because the wind carries it off at right angles to us. But when we get near enough, if we get near enough and are not swallowed by a great fish, then you'll smell it"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Will we be enticed as the birds are?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"No. In fact, human beings find the odor most disagreeable."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Where does all the stuff go?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"To the foothills of the island, where it collects in pools and then into hardening clumps. These eventually form into the young of <i>tharakorm,</i> those creatures which generate a levitating gas from dead flesh and plants and which sail the winds. That object in the sky you saw a little while ago was one of the young. Ah! See! There is another!"</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh was silent for a moment as they watched the white thing rise and float toward the pass. Then he said, "The Yawtl is on that one. I can just make out the thin reddish line trailing from him."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was in despair. Even if they could get on a <i>tharakorm</i> and take off into the air, how could they ever trail the thief? The winds would change, and the Yawtl's ship-creature would go on a different path from theirs. Their situation was hopeless.</p>

  <p class="normal">Vana looked pale, and her features were drawn. But she said, "Well, let's get busy."</p>

  <p class="normal">They set to work and by sleep-time almost had their work done. This time, they were using a single large boat.</p>

  <p class="normal">When they woke, they saw a great flock of birds flying upwind toward the island.</p>

  <p class="normal">"More food for the pot," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I would think the valley would be cleaned out of birds in a short time," Deyv observed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"The odor is strong and doesn't thin out entirely for hundreds of miles. And sometimes the supply of birds is low. When that happens, the viri become inactivated. There are long periods when there is no odor emitted. During that time, the birds breed and flourish. Moreover, for some reason, not all birds of each species are attracted, and those that are are usually males. There is a very complicated balance of nature in this, which I hope to study some time. Meanwhile, don't you think we should launch our craft?"</p>

  <p class="normal">They paddled upwind along the bank for a long time. Then they set out directly toward the opposite bank. They knew that the current would be strong and that it would carry them at an angle downward. They hoped the angle would end on the island. According to Sloosh, the Yawtl had done the same thing as they. Its trail went along the shore and when it turned, they turned too.</p>

  <p class="normal">Despite the group's fears, the giant fish didn't attack them. Once, one fish chasing a somewhat smaller one, though still large enough to engulf their boat, came up alongside them. An eye, as large as Deyv's head, looked coldly at them. Then it dived, causing a small whirlpool to rock the boat.</p>

  <p class="normal">As the craft got closer to the island, its occupants could hear the screaming of the birds. A short time later, they smelled the odor. Deyv thought he was going to vomit. Vana looked as if she'd like to. Though they didn't seem sick, the animals were uneasy. Jum whined, and Aejip growled deep in her throat.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri said, "From your reactions I'd say that lacking a sense of smell has advantages in certain situations. But then anything that has its advantages also has its disadvantages."</p>

  <p class="normal">Some of the white stuff had failed to collect in the hollows and was running off into the lake. Birds were swarming on the rocky beaches and diving into the water. Fish made the offshore water boil as they fought with each other and the birds for the stuff.</p>

  <p class="normal">The group beached the boat and advanced through thousands of screaming, cawing, shrieking birds. These hopped or ran out of their way but immediately closed behind them. Carcasses lay around by the hundreds, many of them covered with birds tearing at their flesh. Now and then one of the feeders staggered around in circles, then fell, its wings flopping, its eyes glazing.</p>

  <p class="normal">The stench of decaying flesh was horrible, but it wasn't as bad as the viri perfume. Feathers swirled and fell on or in front of the group. Now and then dung spattered on their hair or skin. Deyv and Vana were in terror that these droppings might infect them.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh, however, said, "As far as I know, the viri can't attack humans. Of course, I could be wrong."</p>

  <p class="normal">"Thanks for your reassurance," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">At last they got to the hills. Here they roamed around looking for the hollows. They saw some young <i>tharakorm</i> being formed in the pools, a fascinating sight. Apparently, first the keel was shaped by the uncountable number of viri. Then the hull was formed as the things lined up row upon row, each virus attached to its neighbors.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I think the viri go into a sort of suspended animation when they're in place," Sloosh said. "It's a wonderful thing, this organization of mindless nerveless half-alive units. I believe that something that might be called a mind even forms deep in the hull. And lines of them form analogs of nerves. Of course, the brain, if it can be called such, is unconscious. But by the time the <i>thardkorm,</i> the ship-creature, is complete, it is ready to take on its symbionts, the <i>khratikl."</i></p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv looked around nervously. "Where are they?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"Don't worry. Not yet anyway."</p>

  <p class="normal">A number of the pools contained only the unformed sticky-looking liquid, in which lay many birds, dead and alive. Some pools had half-laid.—half-formed, rather —keels. Others held almost complete tharakorm, which now did not emit the stink. Not until they had gotten to the foot of the mountain, where the odor choked the two humans and brought tears to their eyes, did they find what they sought.</p>

  <p class="normal">It stood at the bottom of a deep wide hollow supported by buttresses of the hard stuff. These, Sloosh said, would separate from the hull when it was time for flight. The creature had a long and rather wide hull. Its front was shaped like a ship's, but the back part was flared out to make a nearly square stem.</p>

  <p class="normal">"So it'll give the wind plenty of area to push against," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv estimated that it was about one hundred and twenty feet long, thirty feet high, not counting the masts, and forty feet across, not counting the flared stern. It had three mastlike projections about ten feet high. On each side, at right angles, thin arms extended for about fifty feet The sails, so thin that light shone through them, were furled on the bottom arm. Threads ran down the arms to the sails. The whole ship was composed of very thin material, which was semiopaque.</p>

  <p class="normal">Going closer to look, because the birds swarming over it were obstructing his view, Deyv saw knoblike swellings on the masts and arms. These, Sloosh said, were mechanisms for hoisting or lowering the sails. They also allowed the arms to swing out to a limited degree.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It can sail against the wind if if s not more than a gentle breeze."</p>

  <p class="normal">"How can it do that?" Deyv said. "It doesn't have the resistance against the hull that a water boat does."</p>

  <p class="normal">"It creates a magnetic field which operates with or against the currents of the Earth. But that requires some power, so I suppose the <i>tharakorm</i> seldom does anything but go where the wind pushes it. It does, however, have sensors which detect both the strength of the wind and the alignment of earth currents. In former times, I believe, it could tack against stronger winds. But now that the Earth has a more feeble magnetic field, it lacks the power."</p>

  <p class="normal">There were also round openings on the sides. Deyv couldn't see those on the bottom, but he knew they would be there.</p>

  <p class="normal">From the top of the hill, he could see that there were three larger openings on the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Observe," Sloosh said. "The birds are disappearing into the hull. They're being tempted by a perfume even stronger, hence, more enticing, than that emitted by the liquid."</p>

  <p class="normal">It was true. The avians were fighting to get through the openings.</p>

  <p class="normal">"They'll be trapped and eaten belowdecks. The <i>tharakorm</i> then uses their bodies to generate the gas."</p>

  <p class="normal">They waited until sleep-time. Sloosh told them they must appoint watches.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Notice that more birds are settling on it. But a time will come when the birds will suddenly avoid it. You'll smell another type of perfume then. This will drive the birds away. When this happens, the watch must wake everybody up. I can't smell that perfume, of course, but if I'm on watch then, I'll see that the birds are staying away from it."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv didn't ask why this happened. He had figured out that the thing was repulsing the birds so that it could lift up. If it was covered by hundreds of them, it would never be able to get off the ground.</p>

  <p class="normal">When all were awake, they saw that the time had not yet come for levitation. They sat under the bright hot sky or took short walks. The fruit and berries they'd brought in baskets were eaten. Jum and Aejip devoured some of the newly dead birds. When they wanted water, they went down to the shore and looked for relatively unpolluted water.</p>

  <p class="normal">"What'll we do for food and water when we're aboard?" Deyv asked.</p>

  <p class="normal">"We'll suffer until we can endure it no longer," the Archkerri said complacently. "Then we'll punch a hole in the gas containers of the tharakorm. It'll sink, and we'll get off when it grounds. That, I imagine, is what the Yawti will do."</p>

  <p class="normal">Another sleep-time came. The humans and the Archkerri were getting hungry. But they went to bed, such as it was, with Vana standing watch. It seemed to Deyv he had just shut his eyes when he was awakened. Vana was shaking his shoulder. A very fragrant odor hung in the air.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It must be time. The birds are gone."</p>

  <p class="normal">He got up. The others were all awake. At least, he supposed the Archkerri was. He slept standing up.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Now's the time," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">They went down the hillside and onto the sticky white-streaked mud at the bottom of the hollow. Deyv felt repulsion and some fear. Despite what the Archkerri said, or maybe because of it, he wasn't sure that the stuff wasn't fatal to humans.</p>

  <p class="normal">Approaching the <i>tharakorm,</i> Deyv looked up one of the supports. Then he climbed up its curve, gripping with his hands and walking on his feet like a monkey. While Vana was ascending, he lowered his rope. Sloosh tied the end around Jum, and Deyv hauled the dog up. He repeated the feat with Aejip, whose claws couldn't grip the smooth hard stuff.</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh then tied the rope around the junction of his lower and upper torsos. He bent the latter until it was parallel to the ground, and he began inching up the support. His four thighs gripped the arch of the <i>tharakorm</i> and moved in coordination with his two hands. Meanwhile, the two humans pulled on the rope to relieve him of some of his weight. After much sweating and straining, they got the plant-man over the edge of the deck.</p>

  <p class="normal">He stood up and said, "Now, we'll see if my weight added to yours is too much. I doubt it, since the pack of <i>khratikl</i> it carries must be more than our combined weights."</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv, Vana, and the cat went belowdecks to explore. Instead of ladders, the thing had grown ramps with corrugated surfaces. These allowed the claws of its symbionts enough purchase to ascend them. They were also good enough for the humans and the cat. But the dog and the Archkerri might have trouble.</p>

  <p class="normal">There were four decks, each about seven and a half feet high. The <i>tharakorm</i> had a number of rooms and corridors, but most of the ship-creature was walled off. According to Sloosh, the space behind the walls contained the large cells for the gas, the gas-generating organs, the central nervous system, or what corresponded to such, and perhaps space for unknown "equipment" and ballast.</p>

  <p class="normal">The illumination within was enough to see by. The portholes on the sides and bottom and the entrances on top admitted light The very thin though hard walls leaked light. Only in the innermost rooms was it so dark that the humans could barely make out their way. The <i>khratikl,</i> however, had catlike eyes, so they would have no more trouble seeing than Aejip.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv and Vana went back up and described what they'd found to Sloosh.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's like all the others. I've examined a dead, or, to be exact, a nonoperating, one."</p>

  <p class="normal">They waited. Deyv and Vana became more and more nervous as time passed. Finally, just as it was about sleep-time, the <i>tharakorm</i> began lifting. Its ascent was so gentle that they would not have noticed it if their eyes had been closed and if the supports hadn't fallen in the mud with a soft sound. The area around them receded below.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv was frightened. He felt that he was in an unreal situation, one which he'd never experienced before and which shouldn't have ever happened. But there he was. The birds and the island they were on began to shrink, and presently they were over the lake, the island below and behind.</p>

  <p class="normal">One of the strange sensations was that he didn't feel the wind.</p>

  <p class="normal">"That's because we're going at the same speed as the wind," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">He was walking around the deck, so Deyv decided that he could get up. Evidently, the deck wasn't going to tilt if he went to one side of it.</p>

  <p class="normal">The animals didn't seem to be bothered. Deyv felt somewhat ashamed of his near-panic. However, Vana's paleness and tight voice indicated that she shared his reactions.</p>

  <p class="normal">The powerful pleasant perfume had faded.</p>

  <p class="normal">"Soon will come the hard part," Sloosh said.</p>

  <p class="normal">He estimated they were about five thousand feet high. A thousand feet ahead was the pass. Deyv became alarmed then because it looked as if the <i>tharakorm</i> would come very near one side of a mountain.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I wouldn't worry about that," the Archkerri said. "The two we saw ascend also floated close to that projection of the mountain. There's a reason for it The reason is wnat we have to worry about."</p>

  <p class="normal">The trees along the edge of the outthrust were alive with <i>khratild.</i> Their squealdngs and chitterings reached Deyv before he saw them. Then, as the <i>tharakorm</i> drifted nearer, he saw the brownish shapes swarming everywhere along the lip. Now he understood what Sloosh had meant The dangerous animals were waiting for the <i>tharakorm</i> as it came along. There would be a race, and those who got there first would be its crew. If you could call them a crew, since they'd have nothing to do with the sailing. All they did was to provide food for the generation of gas. But that was a vital service. In return, the shipcreature gave the crew a splendid chance to feed themselves, to observe from above potential victims, and to swoop down on them. Their feeding territory was constantly changing, and so they couldn't deplete it</p>

  <p class="normal">"The Yawti's impressions go as far as I can see," the Archkerri said. "Evidently, he made it to that point, and he had nobody to help him. However, the tracks of the <i>khratikl</i> also go as far as I can see. So perhaps they overcame him. Well, we shall see what we can do."</p>

  <p class="normal">Before the tharakorm got to the nearer edge of the projection, a cloud of khratikl dropped off the outer tips of the tree branches. They fell toward the lake, their wings flapping. Presently, long before they neared the surface, they ceased to fall, and their wings caught hold of the air. Then they were coming up toward their intended berth.</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv counted about fifty of them.</p>

  <p class="normal">They came in a closely packed group from ahead and below and then were around their would-be host. Instead of attacking at once, as he had expected, they broke into a circle four deep. Around and around they flew, getting nearer as time went by. Then he could see the rattish faces, the wet dull-yellow incisors, the humanlike hands, the leathery wings, and the yellow eyes. Their cries came to him, and after a while he thought he could detect intonations and rhythms similar to human speech.</p>

  <p class="normal">Whether they were actually using language or had a system of signals, they didn't sound angry or hostile. They seemed more puzzled than anything else.</p>

  <p class="normal">The vessel passed beyond the mountain, and soon they were over a broad plain. Beyond that were other peaks, but these seemed less tall. Now the calls from the wheeling beasts were plaintive. No doubt about that. Then one, probably the leader, headed back for the pass, and the others followed.</p>

  <p class="normal">"By Tirsh, what happened?" Vana asked. She looked as relieved, but as astounded, as Deyv felt.</p>

  <p class="normal">"I don't know," Deyv said.</p>

  <p class="normal">"It's a revelation to me," Sloosh said. "But you can't blame me for not knowing what would happen. The crystal never showed me anything like that. And apparently the crystals of my predecessors and contemporaries didn't either. I think, though, that I know why we, and the Yawtl, survived."</p>

  <p class="normal">There was a long pause while Sloosh stood with his eyes closed. Finally, Deyv, irritated, asked, "Why?"</p>

  <p class="normal">The Archkerri opened his green eyes. "That opened a path to relevant exploration. Yes. What happened was that the khratikl came against a novel experience. They seem to be fairly intelligent, though they are not sentient, that is, capable of self-consciousness. Still, it might be possible that there could be an intelligence equal even to mine which could, at the same time, be without self-consciousness."</p>

  <p class="normal">Sloosh closed his eyes again.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a short while, Deyv said loudly, "Sloosh! Where are you?"</p>

  <p class="normal">"I'm here, where I've always been. I was here when you last addressed me. Oh! I see what you mean. These symbionts of the ship-creature, though they have a certain intelligence, are still primarily guided by instinct. They expect, guided by their evolutionarily programmed genes, to board an unoccupied <i>tharakorm.</i> So, when they encountered a <i>tharakorm</i> occupied by the Yawtl and one occupied by us, they were in a new situation. They didn't know how to handle it. Thus, instead of attacking us, as true sentients would have, they rejected the situation as outside their instinctual experience. And they returned to the ledge of the mountain to board the next <i>tharakorm</i> that comes along.</p>

  <p class="normal">"However, their programs have been upset. What will happen to those who come back but who should have been comfortably situated? Will they then have to battle with those who expected that they would inhabit the third one? Is there a pecking order that determines who gets in the front of the line? Or is this determined entirely by the age of the <i>khratikl?</i> Or ... ?"</p>

  <p class="normal">Deyv sometimes found the Archkerri's speculations interesting. Just now he wanted to know how they were going to survive. Everybody aboard was suffering from hunger, and soon they'd all be thirsty.</p>
